      <text bytes="78614" xml:space="preserve">'''DNA damage''' is distinctly different from [[mutation]], although both are types of error in [[DNA]].  DNA damage is an abnormal chemical structure in DNA, while a mutation is a change in the sequence of standard base pairs. DNA damages cause changes in the structure of the genetic material and prevents the replication mechanism from functioning and performing properly.&lt;ref name="Köhler 2016 443–460"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Initiation of DNA Replication in Eukaryotes |last=Köhler |first=Kerstin |last2=Ferreira |first2=Pedro |last3=Pfander |first3=Boris |last4=Boos |first4=Dominik | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016 |publisher=Springer, Cham|isbn=9783319246949|pages=443–460|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-24696-3_22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA damage and mutation have different biological consequences.  While most DNA damages can undergo [[DNA repair]], such repair is not 100% efficient.  Un-repaired DNA damages accumulate in non-replicating cells, such as cells in the brains or muscles of adult mammals, and can cause aging.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Payne CM, Bernstein C, Garewal H, Dvorak K (2008).

In replicating cells, such as cells lining the colon, errors occur upon replication past damages in the [[DNA replication|template]] strand of DNA or during repair of DNA damages.  These errors can give rise to [[mutation]]s or [[epigenetic]] alterations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Hagan HM, Mohammad HP, Baylin SB | title = Double strand breaks can initiate gene silencing and SIRT1-dependent onset of DNA methylation in an exogenous promoter CpG island | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = e1000155 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18704159 | pmc = 2491723 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these types of alteration can be replicated and passed on to subsequent cell generations.  These alterations can change gene function or regulation of gene expression and possibly contribute to progression to cancer.

Throughout the cell cycle there are various checkpoints to ensure the cell is in good condition to progress to mitosis. The three main checkpoints are at G1/s, G2/m, and at the spindle assembly checkpoint regulating progression through anaphase. [[G1 phase|G1]] and [[G2 phase|G2]] checkpoints involve scanning for damaged DNA.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/cellular-molecular-biology/stem-cells-and-cancer/a/cell-cycle-checkpoints-article|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During S phase the cell is more vulnerable to DNA damage than any other part of the cell cycle. G2 checkpoint checks for damaged DNA and DNA replication completeness. '''DNA damage''' is an alteration in the chemical structure of [[DNA]], such as a break in a strand of DNA, a base missing from the backbone of DNA, or a chemically changed base such as [[8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine|8-OHdG]]. DNA damage can occur naturally or via environmental factors. The DNA damage response (DDR) is a complex signal transduction pathway which recognizes when DNA is damaged and initiates the cellular response to the damage.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ciccia A, Elledge SJ | title = The DNA damage response: making it safe to play with knives | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 179–204 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20965415 | pmc = 2988877 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2010.09.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Damage to DNA that occurs naturally can result from [[Metabolism|metabolic]] or [[Hydrolysis|hydrolytic]] processes.  Metabolism releases compounds that damage DNA including [[reactive oxygen species]], [[reactive nitrogen species]], reactive [[carbonyl]] species, [[lipid peroxidation]] products and [[Alkylation|alkylating agents]], among others, while hydrolysis cleaves chemical bonds in DNA.&lt;ref name="DeBont"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = De Bont R, van Larebeke N | title = Endogenous DNA damage in humans: a review of quantitative data | journal = Mutagenesis | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 169–85 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15123782 | doi = 10.1093/mutage/geh025 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturally occurring oxidative DNA damages arise at least 10,000 times per cell per day in humans and 50,000 times or more per cell per day in rats,{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}} as documented below.

Other types of endogeneous DNA damages, given below with their frequencies of occurrence, include [[depurination]]s, [[APEX1|depyrimidinations]], [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|double-strand breaks]], [[6-O-Methylguanine|O6-methylguanines]] and [[Deamination#cytosine|cytosine deamination]].

DNA can be damaged via environmental factors as well. Environmental agents such as UV light, ionizing radiation, and genotoxic chemicals. Replication forks can be stalled due to damaged DNA and double strand breaks are also a form of DNA damage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cell Cycle: Principles of Control|last=Morgan|first=David|publisher=New Science Press|year=2006|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important endogenous DNA damage is [[M1G|M1dG]], short for (3-(2'-deoxy-beta-D-erythro-pentofuranosyl)-pyrimido[1,2-a]-purin-10(3H)-one).  The excretion in urine (likely reflecting rate of occurrence) of M1dG may be as much as 1,000-fold lower than that of 8-oxodG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan SW, Dedon PC | title = The biological and metabolic fates of endogenous DNA damage products | journal = Journal of Nucleic Acids | volume = 2010 | issue =  | pages = 929047 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21209721 | pmc = 3010698 | doi = 10.4061/2010/929047 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more important measure may be the steady-state level in DNA, reflecting both rate of occurrence and rate of DNA repair. The steady-state level of M1dG is higher than that of 8-oxodG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kadlubar FF, Anderson KE, Häussermann S, Lang NP, Barone GW, Thompson PA, MacLeod SL, Chou MW, Mikhailova M, Plastaras J, Marnett LJ, Nair J, Velic I, Bartsch H | display-authors = 6 | title = Comparison of DNA adduct levels associated with oxidative stress in human pancreas | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 405 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–33 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9748537 | doi = 10.1016/s0027-5107(98)00129-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This points out that some DNA damages produced at a low rate may be difficult to repair and remain in DNA at a high steady-state level.

===Steady-state levels===
Steady-state levels of DNA damages represent the balance between formation and repair.  More than 100 types of oxidative DNA damage have been characterized, and 8-oxodG constitutes about 5% of the steady state oxidative damages in DNA.&lt;ref name="pmid11353081"/&gt; Helbock et al.&lt;ref name="Helbock"/&gt; estimated that there were 24,000 steady state oxidative DNA adducts per cell in young rats and 66,000 adducts per cell in old rats.  This reflects the accumulation of DNA damage with age.  DNA damage accumulation with age is further described in [[DNA damage theory of aging]].

Swenberg et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swenberg JA, Lu K, Moeller BC, Gao L, Upton PB, Nakamura J, Starr TB | title = Endogenous versus exogenous DNA adducts: their role in carcinogenesis, epidemiology, and risk assessment | journal = Toxicological Sciences | volume = 120 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S130-45 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21163908 | pmc = 3043087 | doi = 10.1093/toxsci/kfq371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; measured average amounts of selected steady state endogenous DNA damages in mammalian cells.

Evaluating steady-state damages in specific tissues of the rat, Nakamura and Swenberg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakamura J, Swenberg JA | title = Endogenous apurinic/apyrimidinic sites in genomic DNA of mammalian tissues | journal = Cancer Research | volume = 59 | issue = 11 | pages = 2522–6 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10363965 }}&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that the number of abasic sites varied from about 50,000 per cell in liver, kidney and lung to about 200,000 per cell in the brain.

== Biomolecular pathways ==
Proteins promoting endogenous DNA damage were identified in a 2019 paper as the DNA "damage-up" proteins (DDPs).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xia J, Chiu LY, Nehring RB, Bravo Núñez MA, Mei Q, Perez M, Zhai Y, Fitzgerald DM, Pribis JP, Wang Y, Hu CW, Powell RT, LaBonte SA, Jalali A, Matadamas Guzmán ML, Lentzsch AM, Szafran AT, Joshi MC, Richters M, Gibson JL, Frisch RL, Hastings PJ, Bates D, Queitsch C, Hilsenbeck SG, Coarfa C, Hu JC, Siegele DA, Scott KL, Liang H, Mancini MA, Herman C, Miller KM, Rosenberg SM | display-authors = 6 | title = Bacteria-to-Human Protein Networks Reveal Origins of Endogenous DNA Damage | journal = Cell | volume = 176 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 127–143.e24 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30633903 | pmc = 6344048 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2018.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DDP mechanisms fall into 3 clusters:

* reactive oxygen increase by transmembrane transporters,
* chromosome loss by replisome binding,
* replication stalling by transcription factors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The DDP human homologs are over-represented in known cancer drivers, and their RNAs in tumors predict heavy mutagenesis and a poor prognosis.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Repair of damaged DNA==
In the presence of DNA damage, the cell can either repair the damage or induce cell death if the damage is beyond repair.

==Aging and cancer==

[[File:DNA damage leads to Aging, Cancer or Apoptosis.jpg|thumb|600px|DNA damage in non-replicating cells, if not repaired and accumulated can lead to aging.  DNA damage in replicating cells, if not repaired can lead to either apoptosis or to cancer.]]

The schematic diagram indicates the roles of insufficient DNA repair in aging and cancer, and the role of apoptosis in cancer prevention.  An excess of naturally occurring DNA damage, due to inherited deficiencies in particular DNA repair enzymes, can cause premature aging or increased risk for cancer (see [[DNA repair-deficiency disorder]]).  On the other hand, the ability to trigger [[apoptosis]] in the presence of excess un-repaired DNA damage is critical for prevention of cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid23070009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nowsheen S, Yang ES | title = The intersection between DNA damage response and cell death pathways | journal = Experimental Oncology | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 243–54 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23070009 | pmc = 3754840 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apoptosis and cancer prevention==

[[DNA repair]] proteins are often activated or induced when DNA has sustained damage.  However, excessive DNA damage can initiate [[apoptosis]] (i.e., programmed cell death) if the level of DNA damage exceeds the repair capacity.  Apoptosis can prevent cells with excess DNA damage from undergoing mutagenesis and progression to cancer.&lt;ref name=Bernsteindual&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein C, Bernstein H, Payne CM, Garewal H | title = DNA repair/pro-apoptotic dual-role proteins in five major DNA repair pathways: fail-safe protection against carcinogenesis | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 511 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–78 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12052432 | doi = 10.1016/s1383-5742(02)00009-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Inflammation#Mediators and DNA damage in cancer|Inflammation]] is often caused by infection, such as with  [[hepatitis B virus]] (HBV), [[hepatitis C virus]] (HCV) or ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''. Chronic inflammation is also a central characteristic of obesity.&lt;ref name="pmid27193454"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deng T, Lyon CJ, Bergin S, Caligiuri MA, Hsueh WA | title = Obesity, Inflammation, and Cancer | journal = Annual Review of Pathology | volume = 11 | issue =  | pages = 421–49 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27193454 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-pathol-012615-044359 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/894754 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Iyengar&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iyengar NM, Gucalp A, Dannenberg AJ, Hudis CA | title = Obesity and Cancer Mechanisms: Tumor Microenvironment and Inflammation | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 34 | issue = 35 | pages = 4270–4276 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27903155 | pmc = 5562428 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2016.67.4283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23819063"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramos-Nino ME | title = The role of chronic inflammation in obesity-associated cancers | journal = ISRN Oncology | volume = 2013 | issue =  | pages = 697521 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23819063 | pmc = 3683483 | doi = 10.1155/2013/697521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/obesity/obesity-fact-sheet#q4 |title = Obesity and Cancer|year = 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such inflammation causes oxidative DNA damage.

At least 17 DNA repair proteins, distributed among five DNA repair pathways, have a "dual role" in response to DNA damage.  With moderate levels of DNA damage, these proteins initiate or contribute to DNA repair.  However, when excessive levels of DNA damage are present, they trigger apoptosis.&lt;ref name=Bernsteindual /&gt;

==DNA damage response==

The packaging of eukaryotic DNA into [[chromatin]] is a barrier to all DNA-based processes that require enzyme action.  For most DNA repair processes, the chromatin must be [[chromatin remodeling|remodeled]].  In eukaryotes, [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-dependent [[chromatin remodeling]] complexes and [[histone-modifying enzymes]] are two factors that act to accomplish this remodeling process after DNA damage occurs.&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu B, Yip RK, Zhou Z | title = Chromatin remodeling, DNA damage repair and aging | journal = Current Genomics | volume = 13 | issue = 7 | pages = 533–47 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23633913 | pmc = 3468886 | doi = 10.2174/138920212803251373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further DNA repair steps, involving multiple enzymes, usually follow.  Some of the first responses to DNA damage, with their timing, are described below.  More complete descriptions of the DNA repair pathways are presented in articles describing each pathway.  At least 169 enzymes are involved in DNA repair pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.mdanderson.org/documents/Labs/Wood-Laboratory/human-dna-repair-genes.html |title = Human DNA repair genes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Base excision repair===

Oxidized bases in DNA are produced in cells treated with Hoechst dye followed by micro-irradiation with 405&amp;nbsp;nm light.&lt;ref name=Abdou&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abdou I, Poirier GG, Hendzel MJ, Weinfeld M | title = DNA ligase III acts as a DNA strand break sensor in the cellular orchestration of DNA strand break repair | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 875–92 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25539916 | pmc = 4333375 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gku1307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such oxidized bases can be repaired by [[base excision repair]].

When the 405&amp;nbsp;nm light is focused along a narrow line within the nucleus of a cell, about 2.5 seconds after irradiation, the chromatin remodeling enzyme [[CHD1L|Alc1]] achieves half-maximum recruitment onto the irradiated micro-line.&lt;ref name=Sellou&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sellou H, Lebeaupin T, Chapuis C, Smith R, Hegele A, Singh HR, Kozlowski M, Bultmann S, Ladurner AG, Timinszky G, Huet S | display-authors = 6 | title = The poly(ADP-ribose)-dependent chromatin remodeler Alc1 induces local chromatin relaxation upon DNA damage | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 27 | issue = 24 | pages = 3791–3799 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27733626 | pmc = 5170603 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.E16-05-0269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The line of chromatin that was irradiated then relaxes, expanding side-to-side over the next 60 seconds.&lt;ref name=Sellou /&gt;

Within 6 seconds of the irradiation with 405&amp;nbsp;nm light, there is half-maximum recruitment of  [[Oxoguanine glycosylase|OGG1]] to the irradiated line.&lt;ref name=Abdou /&gt;  OGG1 is an enzyme that removes the oxidative DNA damage [[8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine|8-oxo-dG]] from DNA.  Removal of 8-oxo-dG, during base excision repair, occurs with a half-life of 11 minutes.&lt;ref name="pmid11353081"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton ML, Guo Z, Fuller CD, Van Remmen H, Ward WF, Austad SN, Troyer DA, Thompson I, Richardson A | display-authors = 6 | title = A reliable assessment of 8-oxo-2-deoxyguanosine levels in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA using the sodium iodide method to isolate DNA | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 29 | issue = 10 | pages = 2117–26 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11353081 | pmc = 55450 | doi = 10.1093/nar/29.10.2117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nucleotide excision repair===

[[Ultraviolet]] (UV) light induces the formation of DNA damages including [[pyrimidine dimer]]s (such as thymine dimers) and 6,4 photoproducts.  These types of "bulky" damages are repaired by [[nucleotide excision repair]].

After irradiation with UV light, [[DDB2]], in a complex with [[DDB1]], the [[ubiquitin ligase]] protein [[CUL4A]] and the RING finger protein ROC1, associates with sites of damage within chromatin. Half-maximum association occurs in 40 seconds.&lt;ref name=Luijsterburg2007&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luijsterburg MS, Goedhart J, Moser J, Kool H, Geverts B, Houtsmuller AB, Mullenders LH, Vermeulen W, van Driel R | display-authors = 6 | title = Dynamic in vivo interaction of DDB2 E3 ubiquitin ligase with UV-damaged DNA is independent of damage-recognition protein XPC | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 120 | issue = Pt 15 | pages = 2706–16 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17635991 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.008367 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PARP1]] also associates within this period.&lt;ref name=Pines&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pines A, Vrouwe MG, Marteijn JA, Typas D, Luijsterburg MS, Cansoy M, Hensbergen P, Deelder A, de Groot A, Matsumoto S, Sugasawa K, Thoma N, Vermeulen W, Vrieling H, Mullenders L | display-authors = 6 | title = PARP1 promotes nucleotide excision repair through DDB2 stabilization and recruitment of ALC1 | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 199 | issue = 2 | pages = 235–49 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23045548 | pmc = 3471223 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.201112132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The PARP1 protein attaches to both DDB1 and DDB2 and then [[ADP-ribosylation#Poly ADP-ribosylation|PARylates]] (creates a poly-ADP ribose chain) on DDB2 that attracts the DNA remodeling protein [[CHD1L|ALC1]].&lt;ref name=Pines /&gt;  ALC1 relaxes chromatin at sites of UV damage to DNA.  In addition, the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex DDB1-CUL4A carries out ubiquitination of the core [[histone]]s H2A, H3, and H4, as well as the repair protein XPC, which has been attracted to the site of the DNA damage.&lt;ref name="pmid22822215"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yeh JI, Levine AS, Du S, Chinte U, Ghodke H, Wang H, Shi H, Hsieh CL, Conway JF, Van Houten B, Rapić-Otrin V | display-authors = 6 | title = Damaged DNA induced UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB) dimerization and its roles in chromatinized DNA repair | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 41 | pages = E2737-46 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22822215 | pmc = 3478663 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1110067109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  XPC, upon ubiquitination, is activated and initiates the [[nucleotide excision repair]] pathway.  Somewhat later, at 30 minutes after UV damage, the [[Chromatin remodeling#Known chromatin remodeling complexes|INO80]] chromatin remodeling complex is recruited to the site of the DNA damage, and this coincides with the binding of further nucleotide excision repair proteins, including [[ERCC1]].&lt;ref name="pmid20855601"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang Y, Wang X, Bao S, Guo R, Johnson DG, Shen X, Li L | title = INO80 chromatin remodeling complex promotes the removal of UV lesions by the nucleotide excision repair pathway | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 40 | pages = 17274–9 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20855601 | pmc = 2951448 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1008388107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..10717274J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homologous recombinational repair===

Double-strand breaks (DSBs) at specific sites can be induced by transfecting cells with a plasmid encoding [[Meganuclease I-SceI|I-SceI endonuclease]] (a [[homing endonuclease]]).  Multiple DSBs can be induced by irradiating sensitized cells (labeled with [[Bromodeoxyuridine|5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine]] and with Hoechst dye) with 780&amp;nbsp;nm light.  These DSBs can be repaired by the accurate [[homologous recombination#models|homologous recombinational repair]] or by the less accurate [[non-homologous end joining]] repair pathway.  Here we describe the early steps in homologous recombinational repair (HRR).

After treating cells to introduce DSBs, the stress-activated protein kinase, [[c-Jun N-terminal kinases|c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)]], phosphorylates [[SIRT6]] on serine 10.&lt;ref name=Bohr&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Meter M, Simon M, Tombline G, May A, Morello TD, Hubbard BP, Bredbenner K, Park R, Sinclair DA, Bohr VA, Gorbunova V, Seluanov A | display-authors = 6 | title = JNK Phosphorylates SIRT6 to Stimulate DNA Double-Strand Break Repair in Response to Oxidative Stress by Recruiting PARP1 to DNA Breaks | journal = Cell Reports | volume = 16 | issue = 10 | pages = 2641–2650 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27568560 | pmc = 5089070 | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2016.08.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[post-translational modification]] facilitates the mobilization of SIRT6 to DNA damage sites with half-maximum recruitment in well under a second.&lt;ref name=Bohr /&gt;  SIRT6 at the site is required for efficient recruitment of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) to a DNA break site and for efficient repair of DSBs.&lt;ref name=Bohr /&gt;  [[PARP1]] protein starts to appear at DSBs in less than a second, with half maximum accumulation within 1.6 seconds after the damage occurs.&lt;ref name=Haince&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haince JF, McDonald D, Rodrigue A, Déry U, Masson JY, Hendzel MJ, Poirier GG | title = PARP1-dependent kinetics of recruitment of MRE11 and NBS1 proteins to multiple DNA damage sites | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 283 | issue = 2 | pages = 1197–208 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18025084 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M706734200 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This then allows half maximum recruitment of the DNA repair enzymes [[MRE11A|MRE11]] within 13 seconds and [[MRN complex|NBS1]] within 28 seconds.&lt;ref name=Haince /&gt;  MRE11 and NBS1 carry out early steps of the HRR pathway.

γH2AX, the phosphorylated form of [[H2AFX|H2AX]] is also involved in early steps of DSB repair.  The [[histone]] variant H2AX constitutes about 10% of the H2A histones in human chromatin.&lt;ref name="Rogakou 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogakou EP, Pilch DR, Orr AH, Ivanova VS, Bonner WM | title = DNA double-stranded breaks induce histone H2AX phosphorylation on serine 139 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 273 | issue = 10 | pages = 5858–68 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9488723 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.273.10.5858 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  γH2AX (H2AX phosphorylated on serine 139) can be detected as soon as 20 seconds after irradiation of cells (with DNA double-strand break formation), and half maximum accumulation of γH2AX occurs in one minute.&lt;ref name="Rogakou 1998" /&gt;  The extent of chromatin with phosphorylated γH2AX is about two million base pairs at the site of a DNA double-strand break.&lt;ref name="Rogakou 1998" /&gt;  γH2AX does not, itself, cause chromatin decondensation, but within 30 seconds of irradiation, [[RNF8]] protein can be detected in association with γH2AX.&lt;ref name="pmid18001824"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mailand N, Bekker-Jensen S, Faustrup H, Melander F, Bartek J, Lukas C, Lukas J | title = RNF8 ubiquitylates histones at DNA double-strand breaks and promotes assembly of repair proteins | journal = Cell | volume = 131 | issue = 5 | pages = 887–900 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18001824 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.09.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  RNF8 mediates extensive chromatin decondensation, through its subsequent interaction with [[CHD4]],&lt;ref name="pmid22531782"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luijsterburg MS, Acs K, Ackermann L, Wiegant WW, Bekker-Jensen S, Larsen DH, Khanna KK, van Attikum H, Mailand N, Dantuma NP | display-authors = 6 | title = A new non-catalytic role for ubiquitin ligase RNF8 in unfolding higher-order chromatin structure | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 31 | issue = 11 | pages = 2511–27 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22531782 | pmc = 3365417 | doi = 10.1038/emboj.2012.104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex [[Mi-2/NuRD complex|NuRD]].

===Pause for DNA repair===

After rapid [[chromatin remodeling]], [[cell cycle]] [[cell cycle checkpoint|checkpoints]] may be activated to allow DNA repair to be completed before the cell cycle progresses.  First, two [[kinase]]s, [[ataxia telangiectasia mutated|ATM]] and [[Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3 related|ATR]] are activated within 5 or 6 minutes after DNA is damaged.  This is followed by phosphorylation of the cell cycle checkpoint protein [[CHEK1|Chk1]], initiating its function, about 10 minutes after DNA is damaged.&lt;ref name="pmid16327781"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jazayeri A, Falck J, Lukas C, Bartek J, Smith GC, Lukas J, Jackson SP | title = ATM- and cell cycle-dependent regulation of ATR in response to DNA double-strand breaks | journal = Nature Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–45 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16327781 | doi = 10.1038/ncb1337 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of oxidative damage to guanine in gene regulation==

The DNA damage [[8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine|8-oxo-dG]] does not occur randomly in the genome.  In [[mouse embryonic fibroblast]]s, a 2 to 5-fold enrichment of 8-oxo-dG was found in genetic control regions, including [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]], [[Five prime untranslated region|5'-untranslated regions]] and [[Three prime untranslated region|3'-untranslated regions]] compared to 8-oxo-dG levels found in [[gene]] bodies and in [[intergenic region]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid28150947"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ding Y, Fleming AM, Burrows CJ | title = Sequencing the Mouse Genome for the Oxidatively Modified Base 8-Oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine by OG-Seq | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 139 | issue = 7 | pages = 2569–2572 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28150947 | pmc = 5440228 | doi = 10.1021/jacs.6b12604 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells, when 22,414 protein-coding genes were examined for locations of 8-oxo-dG, the majority of 8-oxo-dGs (when present) were found in promoter regions rather than within gene bodies.&lt;ref name=Pastukh&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pastukh V, Roberts JT, Clark DW, Bardwell GC, Patel M, Al-Mehdi AB, Borchert GM, Gillespie MN | display-authors = 6 | title = An oxidative DNA "damage" and repair mechanism localized in the VEGF promoter is important for hypoxia-induced VEGF mRNA expression | journal = American Journal of Physiology.

As reviewed by Wang et al.,&lt;ref name=WangBoldogh&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang R, Hao W, Pan L, Boldogh I, Ba X | title = The roles of base excision repair enzyme OGG1 in gene expression | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 75 | issue = 20 | pages = 3741–3750 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 30043138 | pmc = 6154017 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-018-2887-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; oxidized guanine appears to have multiple regulatory roles in gene expression.  In particular, when oxidative stress produces 8-oxo-dG in the promoter of a gene, the oxidative stress may also inactivate [[Oxoguanine glycosylase|OGG1]], an enzyme that targets 8-oxo-dG and normally initiates repair of 8-oxo-dG damage.  The inactive OGG1, which no longer excises 8-oxo-dG, nevertheless targets and complexes with 8-oxo-dG, and causes a sharp (~70&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;) bend in the DNA.  This allows the assembly of a transcriptional initiation complex, up-regulating transcription of the associated gene.&lt;ref name=WangBoldogh /&gt;&lt;ref name=Seifermann&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seifermann M, Epe B | title = Oxidatively generated base modifications in DNA: Not only carcinogenic risk factor but also regulatory mark? | journal = Free Radical Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 107 | issue =  | pages = 258–265 | date = June 2017 | pmid = 27871818 | doi = 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2016.11.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When 8-oxo-dG is formed in a guanine rich, [[G-quadruplex|potential G-quadruplex-forming sequence]] (PQS) in the coding strand of a promoter, active OGG1 excises the 8-oxo-dG and generates an [[AP site|apurinic/apyrimidinic site]] (AP site). The AP site enables melting of the duplex to unmask the PQS, adopting a [[G-quadruplex]] fold (G4 structure/motif) that has a regulatory role in transcription activation.&lt;ref name=WangBoldogh /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28629775"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fleming AM, Burrows CJ | title = 8-Oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine, friend and foe: Epigenetic-like regulator versus initiator of mutagenesis | journal = DNA Repair | volume = 56 | issue =  | pages = 75–83 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28629775 | pmc = 5548303 | doi = 10.1016/j.dnarep.2017.06.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When 8-oxo-dG is complexed with active OGG1 it may then recruit [[chromatin remodeling|chromatin remodelers]] to modulate gene expression.  [[CHD4|Chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 (CHD4)]], a component of the [[Mi-2/NuRD complex|(NuRD)]] complex, is recruited by OGG1 to oxidative DNA damage sites.  CHD4 then attracts DNA and histone methylating enzymes that repress transcription of associated genes.&lt;ref name=WangBoldogh /&gt;

==Role of DNA damage in memory formation==

===Oxidation of guanine===

Oxidation of guanine, particularly within [[CpG site]]s, may be especially important in learning and memory.  Methylation of cytosines occurs at 60–90% of CpG sites depending on the tissue type.&lt;ref name=Fasolino&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fasolino M, Zhou Z | title = The Crucial Role of DNA Methylation and MeCP2 in Neuronal Function | journal = Genes | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 141 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28505093 | pmc = 5448015 | doi = 10.3390/genes8050141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mammalian brain, ~62% of CpGs are methylated.&lt;ref name=Fasolino /&gt;  [[CpG site#Methylation of CpG islands stably silences genes|Methylation of CpG sites]] tends to stably silence genes.&lt;ref name="pmid11782440"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bird A | title = DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–21 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11782440 | doi = 10.1101/gad.947102 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 500 of these CpG sites are de-methylated in neuron DNA during [[Hippocampus#Role in memory|memory formation]] and [[memory consolidation]] in the [[hippocampus]]&lt;ref name="pmid28620075"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duke CG, Kennedy AJ, Gavin CF, Day JJ, Sweatt JD | title = Experience-dependent epigenomic reorganization in the hippocampus | journal = Learning &amp; Memory | volume = 24 | issue = 7 | pages = 278–288 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28620075 | pmc = 5473107 | doi = 10.1101/lm.045112.117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Halder&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Halder R, Hennion M, Vidal RO, Shomroni O, Rahman RU, Rajput A, Centeno TP, van Bebber F, Capece V, Garcia Vizcaino JC, Schuetz AL, Burkhardt S, Benito E, Navarro Sala M, Javan SB, Haass C, Schmid B, Fischer A, Bonn S | display-authors = 6 | title = DNA methylation changes in plasticity genes accompany the formation and maintenance of memory | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 102–10 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26656643 | pmc = 4700510 | doi = 10.1038/nn.4194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cingulate cortex]]&lt;ref name=Halder /&gt; regions of the brain.  As indicated below, the first step in de-methylation of methylated cytosine at a CpG site is oxidation of the guanine to form 8-oxo-dG.

===Role of oxidized guanine in DNA de-methylation===

[[File:Initiation of DNA demethylation at a CpG site.svg|thumb|400 px|Initiation of [[DNA demethylation]] at a [[CpG site]]. In adult somatic cells DNA methylation typically occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides ([[CpG sites]]), forming [[5-methylcytosine]]-pG, or 5mCpG. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) may attack guanine at the dinucleotide site, forming [[8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine|8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine]] (8-OHdG), and resulting in a 5mCp-8-OHdG dinucleotide site.  The [[base excision repair]] enzyme [[oxoguanine glycosylase|OGG1]] targets 8-OHdG and binds to the lesion without immediate excision. OGG1, present at a 5mCp-8-OHdG site recruits [[Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1|TET1]] and TET1 oxidizes the 5mC adjacent to the 8-OHdG.  This initiates demethylation of 5mC.&lt;ref name=Zhou&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhou X, Zhuang Z, Wang W, He L, Wu H, Cao Y, Pan F, Zhao J, Hu Z, Sekhar C, Guo Z | display-authors = 6 | title = OGG1 is essential in oxidative stress induced DNA demethylation | journal = Cellular Signalling | volume = 28 | issue = 9 | pages = 1163–71 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27251462 | doi = 10.1016/j.cellsig.2016.05.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The figure in this section shows a CpG site where the cytosine is methylated to form [[5-methylcytosine]] (5mC) and the guanine is oxidized to form [[8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine]] (in the figure this is shown in the tautomeric form 8-OHdG).  When this structure is formed, the [[base excision repair]] enzyme [[Oxoguanine glycosylase|OGG1]] targets 8-OHdG and binds to the lesion without immediate excision.  OGG1, present at a 5mCp-8-OHdG site recruits [[Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1|TET1]], and TET1 oxidizes the 5mC adjacent to the 8-OHdG.  This initiates de-methylation of 5mC.&lt;ref name=Zhou /&gt;  [[Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 1|TET1]] is a key enzyme involved in de-methylating 5mCpG.  However, TET1 is only able to act on 5mCpG if the guanine was first oxidized to form [[8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine]] (8-OHdG or its [[tautomer]] 8-oxo-dG), resulting in a 5mCp-8-OHdG dinucleotide (see figure in this section).&lt;ref name=Zhou /&gt;  This initiates the de-methylation pathway on the methylated cytosine, finally resulting in an unmethylated cytosine (see [[DNA oxidation#Role of oxidized guanine in DNA de-methylation|DNA oxidation]] for further steps in forming unmethylated cytosine).

Altered protein expression in neurons, due to changes in methylation of DNA, (likely controlled by 8-oxo-dG-dependent de-methylation of CpG sites in gene promoters within neuron DNA) has been established as central to memory formation.&lt;ref name="pmid20975755"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Day JJ, Sweatt JD | title = DNA methylation and memory formation | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 13 | issue = 11 | pages = 1319–23 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20975755 | pmc = 3130618 | doi = 10.1038/nn.2666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of double-strand breaks in memory formation===

Exposure of mice to physiological learning behaviors in vivo, such as being exposed to a new environment or activation of the primary visual cortex (V1) by exposing mice to visual stimuli, results in the formation of [[DNA repair#Double-strand breaks|DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)]] in the [[dentate gyrus]] (part of the [[hippocampus]] brain region).&lt;ref name="pmid23525040"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Suberbielle E, Sanchez PE, Kravitz AV, Wang X, Ho K, Eilertson K, Devidze N, Kreitzer AC, Mucke L | display-authors = 6 | title = Physiologic brain activity causes DNA double-strand breaks in neurons, with exacerbation by amyloid-β | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 613–21 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23525040 | pmc = 3637871 | doi = 10.1038/nn.3356 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, exposing mice to contextual [[fear conditioning]], producing a [[long-term memory]], also causes DSBs in the hippocampus within 15 minutes.&lt;ref name=Madabhushi&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Madabhushi R, Gao F, Pfenning AR, Pan L, Yamakawa S, Seo J, Rueda R, Phan TX, Yamakawa H, Pao PC, Stott RT, Gjoneska E, Nott A, Cho S, Kellis M, Tsai LH | display-authors = 6 | title = Activity-Induced DNA Breaks Govern the Expression of Neuronal Early-Response Genes | journal = Cell | volume = 161 | issue = 7 | pages = 1592–605 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26052046 | pmc = 4886855 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These neuronal activity-induced DSBs are restricted to only 21  loci in the neuron genome, and these loci are also enriched for the [[Immediate early gene|early response genes]] (including [[C-Fos|Fos]], [[FosB]], [[Neuronal PAS domain protein 4|Npas4]], [[Egr1]], [[Nerve growth factor IB|Nr4a1]] and [[Neuron-derived orphan receptor 1|Nr4a3]]) in neuron activation.&lt;ref name=Madabhushi /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21326363"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pérez-Cadahía B, Drobic B, Davie JR | title = Activation and function of immediate-early genes in the nervous system | journal = Biochemistry and Cell Biology | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–73 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21326363 | doi = 10.1139/O10-138 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b4d1e3bd20cc73377904e5daf2aa399223a03f42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These neural activity-induced DNA breaks are generated by a Type II topoisomerase.&lt;ref name=Madabhushi /&gt;  An inhibitor of [[Non-homologous end joining|NHEJ]] DSB repair, [[Arabinofuranosylcytosine triphosphate|ara-CTP]], (likely inhibiting repair of such double-strand breaks), prevents [[long-term memory]] formation.&lt;ref name="pmid16707804"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Colón-Cesario M, Wang J, Ramos X, García HG, Dávila JJ, Laguna J, Rosado C, Peña de Ortiz S | display-authors = 6 | title = An inhibitor of DNA recombination blocks memory consolidation, but not reconsolidation, in context fear conditioning | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 26 | issue = 20 | pages = 5524–33 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16707804 | pmc = 6675301 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3050-05.2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role of ATR and ATM==

Most damage can be repaired without triggering the damage response system, however more complex damage activates ATR and ATM, key protein kinases in the damage response system.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Giglia-Mari G, Zotter A, Vermeulen W | title = DNA damage response | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = a000745 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20980439 | pmc = 3003462 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a000745 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA damage inhibits M-CDKs which are a key component of progression into [[Mitosis]].

In all eukaryotic cells, ATR and ATM are protein kinases that detect DNA damage. They bind to DNA damaged sites and activate [[CHEK1|Chk1]], [[CHEK2|Chk2]], and, in animal cells, [[TP53|p53]]. Together, these proteins make up the DNA damage response system. Some DNA damage does not require the recruitment of ATR and ATM, it is only difficult and extensive damage that requires ATR and ATM. ATM and ATR are required for NHEJ, HR, ICL repair, and NER, as well as replication fork stability during unperturbed DNA replication and in response to replication blocks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

ATR is recruited for different forms of damage such as nucleotide damage, stalled replication forks and double strand breaks. ATM is specifically for the damage response to double strand breaks. The MRN complex (composed of Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1) form immediately at the site of double strand break. This MRN complex recruits ATM to the site of damage. ATR and ATM phosphorylate various proteins that contribute to the damage repair system. The binding of ATR and ATM to damage sites on DNA lead to the recruitment of Chk1 and Chk2. These protein kinases send damage signals to the cell cycle control system to delay the progression of the cell cycle.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Chk1 and Chk2 functions==
Chk1 leads to the production of DNA repair enzymes. Chk2 leads to reversible cell cycle arrest. Chk2, as well as ATR/ATM, can activate p53, which leads to permanent cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.

==p53 role in DNA damage repair system==
When there is too much damage, apoptosis is triggered in order to protect the organism from potentially harmful cells.7 p53, also known as a tumor suppressor gene, is a major regulatory protein in the DNA damage response system which binds directly to the promoters of its target genes. p53 acts primarily at the G1 checkpoint (controlling the G1 to S transition), where it blocks cell cycle progression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Activation of p53 can trigger cell death or permanent cell cycle arrest. p53 can also activate certain repair pathways such was NER.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Regulation of p53===
In the absence of DNA damage, p53 is regulated by Mdm2 and constantly degraded. When there is DNA damage, Mdm2 is phosphorylated, most likely caused by ATM. The phosphorylation of Mdm2 leads to a reduction in the activity of Mdm2, thus preventing the degradation of p53. Normal, undamaged cell, usually has low levels of p53 while cells under stress and DNA damage, will have high levels of p53.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===p53 serves as transcription factor for bax and p21===
p53 serves as a transcription factors for both [[BAX protein|bax]], a proapoptotic protein as well as [[p21]], a CDK inhibitor. CDK Inhibitors result in cell cycle arrest. Arresting the cell provides the cell time to repair the damage, and if the damage is irreparable, p53 recruits bax to trigger apoptosis.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== DDR and p53 role in cancer ===
p53 is a major key player in the growth of cancerous cells. Damaged DNA cells with mutated p53 are at a higher risk of becoming cancerous. Common chemotherapy treatments are genotoxic. These treatments are ineffective in cancer tumor that have mutated p53 since they do not have a functioning p53 to either arrest or kill the damaged cell.

==A major problem for life==
One indication that DNA damages are a major problem for life is that DNA repair processes, to cope with DNA damages, have been found in all cellular organisms in which DNA repair has been investigated.  For example, in bacteria, a regulatory network aimed at repairing DNA damages (called the SOS response in ''Escherichia coli'') has been found in many bacterial species.  ''E. coli'' RecA, a key enzyme in the SOS response pathway, is the defining member of a ubiquitous class of DNA strand-exchange proteins that are essential for homologous recombination, a pathway that maintains genomic integrity by repairing broken DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bell JC, Plank JL, Dombrowski CC, Kowalczykowski SC | title = Direct imaging of RecA nucleation and growth on single molecules of SSB-coated ssDNA | journal = Nature | volume = 491 | issue = 7423 | pages = 274–8 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23103864 | pmc = 4112059 | doi = 10.1038/nature11598 | bibcode = 2012Natur.491..274B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genes homologous to ''RecA'' and to other central genes in the SOS response pathway are found in almost all the bacterial genomes sequenced to date, covering a large number of phyla, suggesting both an ancient origin and a widespread occurrence of recombinational repair of DNA damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Erill I, Campoy S, Barbé J | year = 2007 | title = Aeons of distress: an evolutionary perspective on the bacterial SOS response | url = | journal = FEMS Microbiol Rev. | volume = 31 | issue = 6| pages = 637–656 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2007.00082.x | pmid = 17883408 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] recombinases that are homologues of RecA are also widespread in eukaryotic organisms.  For example, in fission yeast and humans, RecA homologues promote duplex-duplex DNA-strand exchange needed for repair of many types of DNA lesions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murayama Y, Kurokawa Y, Mayanagi K, Iwasaki H | title = Formation and branch migration of Holliday junctions mediated by eukaryotic recombinases | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7181 | pages = 1018–21 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18256600 | doi = 10.1038/nature06609 | bibcode = 2008Natur.451.1018M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holthausen JT, Wyman C, Kanaar R | year = 2010 | title = Regulation of DNA strand exchange in homologous recombination | url = | journal = DNA Repair (Amst) | volume = 9 | issue = 12| pages = 1264–1272 | pmid = 20971042 | doi = 10.1016/j.dnarep.2010.09.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another indication that DNA damages are a major problem for life is that cells make large investments in DNA repair processes.  As pointed out by Hoeijmakers,&lt;ref name="Hoeijmakers JH. 2009"/&gt; repairing just one double-strand break could require more than 10,000 [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecules, as used in signaling the presence of the damage, the generation of repair foci, and the formation (in humans) of the RAD51 nucleofilament (an intermediate in homologous recombinational repair).  (RAD51 is a homologue of bacterial RecA.) If the structural modification occurs during the G1 phase of DNA replication, the G1-S checkpoint arrests or postpones the furtherance of the cell cycle before the product enters the S phase.&lt;ref name="Köhler 2016 443–460"/&gt;

==Consequences==

Differentiated somatic cells of adult mammals generally replicate infrequently or not at all.  Such cells, including, for example, brain neurons and muscle myocytes, have little or no cell turnover.  Non-replicating cells do not generally generate mutations due to DNA damage-induced errors of replication.  These non-replicating cells do not commonly give rise to cancer, but they do accumulate DNA damages with time that likely contribute to aging (''{{xref|see [[DNA damage theory of aging]]}}'').  In a non-replicating cell, a single-strand break or other type of damage in the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] strand of DNA can block RNA polymerase II-catalysed transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kathe SD, Shen GP, Wallace SS | title = Single-stranded breaks in DNA but not oxidative DNA base damages block transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II in HeLa cell nuclear extracts | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 279 | issue = 18 | pages = 18511–20 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 14978042 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M313598200 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would interfere with the synthesis of the protein coded for by the gene in which the blockage occurred.

As discussed above, these accumulated single-strand breaks would be expected to block transcription of genes.  Consistent with this, as reviewed by Hetman et al.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hetman M, Vashishta A, Rempala G | year = 2010 | title = Neurotoxic mechanisms of DNA damage: focus on transcriptional inhibition | journal = J.

Another type of DNA damage, the double-strand break, was shown to cause cell death (loss of cells) through [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carnevale J, Palander O, Seifried LA, Dick FA | title = DNA damage signals through differentially modified E2F1 molecules to induce apoptosis | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 900–12 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22184068 | pmc = 3295199 | doi = 10.1128/MCB.06286-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of DNA damage would not accumulate with age, since once a cell was lost through apoptosis, its double-strand damage would be lost with it. Thus, damaged DNA segments undermine the DNA replication machinery because these altered sequences of DNA cannot be utilized as true templates to produce copies of one's genetic material.&lt;ref name="Köhler 2016 443–460"/&gt;

==RAD genes and the cell cycle response to DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae==

When DNA is damaged, the cell responds in various ways to fix the damage and minimize the effects on the cell. One such response, specifically in eukaryotic cells, is to delay cell division—the cell becomes arrested for some time in the G2 phase before progressing through the rest of the cell cycle. Various studies have been conducted to elucidate the purpose of this G2 arrest that is induced by DNA damage. Researchers have found that cells that are prematurely forced out of the delay have lower cell viability and higher rates of damaged chromosomes compared with cells that are able to undergo a full G2 arrest, suggesting that the purpose of the delay is to give the cell time to repair damaged chromosomes before continuing with the cell cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hittelman WN, Rao PN | year = 1975  | title = Mutat. Res.'' '''23''' 1974; 251; A.P. Rao and P.N. Rao, ''J. Natl. Cancer Inst.'' '''57''' 1976; 1139; W.N. Hittelman and P.N. Rao, ''Cancer Res.'' '''34''' 1974; 3433; | url = | journal = | volume = 35 | issue = | page = 3027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ensures the proper functioning of mitosis.

Various species of animals exhibit similar mechanisms of cellular delay in response to DNA damage, which can be caused by exposure to x-irradiation. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has specifically been studied because progression through the cell cycle can be followed via nuclear morphology with ease. By studying Saccharomyces cerevisiae, researchers have been able to learn more about radiation-sensitive (RAD) genes, and the effect that RAD mutations may have on the typical cellular DNA damaged-induced delay response. Specifically, the RAD9 gene plays a crucial role in detecting DNA damage and arresting the cell in G2 until the damage is repaired.

Through extensive experiments, researchers have been able to illuminate the role that the RAD genes play in delaying cell division in response to DNA damage. When wild-type, growing cells are exposed to various levels of x-irradiation over a given time frame, and then analyzed with a [[microcolony]] assay, differences in the cell cycle response can be observed based on which genes are mutated in the cells. For instance, while unirradiated cells will progress normally through the cell cycle, cells that are exposed to x-irradiation either permanently arrest (become inviable) or delay in the G2 phase before continuing to divide in mitosis, further corroborating the idea that the G2 delay is crucial for DNA repair. However, rad strains, which are deficient in DNA repair, exhibit a markedly different response. For instance, rad52 cells, which cannot repair double-stranded DNA breaks, tend to permanently arrest in G2 when exposed to even very low levels of x-irradiation, and rarely end up progressing through the later stages of the cell cycle. This is because the cells cannot repair DNA damage and thus do not enter mitosis. Various other rad mutants exhibit similar responses when exposed to x-irradiation.

However, the rad9 strain exhibits an entirely different effect. These cells fail to delay in the G2 phase when exposed to x-irradiation, and end up progressing through the cell cycle unperturbed, before dying. This suggests that the RAD9 gene, unlike the other RAD genes, plays a crucial role in initiating G2 arrest. To further investigate these findings, the cell cycles of double mutant strains have been analyzed. A mutant rad52 rad9 strain—which is both defective in DNA repair and G2 arrest—fails to undergo cell cycle arrest when exposed to x-irradiation. This suggests that even if DNA damage cannot be repaired, if RAD9 is not present, the cell cycle will not delay. Thus, unrepaired DNA damage is the signal that tells RAD9 to halt division and arrest the cell cycle in G2. Furthermore, there is a dose-dependent response; as the levels of x-irradiation—and subsequent DNA damage—increase, more cells, regardless of the mutations they have, become arrested in G2.

Another, and perhaps more helpful way to visualize this effect is to look at photomicroscopy slides. Initially, slides of RAD+ and rad9 haploid cells in the exponential phase of growth show simple, single cells, that are indistinguishable from each other. However, the slides look much different after being exposed to x-irradiation for 10 hours. The RAD+ slides now show RAD+ cells existing primarily as two-budded microcolonies, suggesting that cell division has been arrested. In contrast, the rad9 slides show the rad9 cells existing primarily as 3 to 8 budded colonies, and they appear smaller than the RAD+ cells. This is further evidence that the mutant RAD cells continued to divide and are deficient in G2 arrest.

However, there is evidence that although the RAD9 gene is necessary to induce G2 arrest in response to DNA damage, giving the cell time to repair the damage, it does not actually play a direct role in repairing DNA. When rad9 cells are artificially arrested in G2 with MBC, a microtubule poison that prevents cellular division, and then treated with x-irradiation, the cells are able to repair their DNA and eventually progress through the cell cycle, dividing into viable cells. Thus, the RAD9 gene plays no role in actually repairing damaged DNA—it simply senses damaged DNA and responds by delaying cell division. The delay, then, is mediated by a control mechanism, rather than the physical damaged DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weinert TA, Hartwell LH | title = The RAD9 gene controls the cell cycle response to DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = Science | volume = 241 | issue = 4863 | pages = 317–22 | date = July 1988 | pmid = 3291120 | doi = 10.1126/science.3291120 | bibcode = 1988Sci...241..317W | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/79e56c51caca96ee489196f2e30075b3a0ea822d }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it is possible that there are backup mechanisms that fill the role of RAD9 when it is not present. In fact, some studies have found that RAD9 does indeed play a critical role in DNA repair. In one study, rad9 mutant and normal cells in the exponential phase of growth were exposed to UV-irradiation and synchronized in specific phases of the cell cycle. After being incubated to permit DNA repair, the extent of pyrimidine dimerization (which is indicative of DNA damage) was assessed using sensitive primer extension techniques. It was found that the removal of DNA photolesions was much less efficient in rad9 mutant cells than normal cells, providing evidence that RAD9 is involved in DNA repair. Thus, the role of RAD9 in repairing DNA damage remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Al-Moghrabi NM, Al-Sharif IS, Aboussekhra A | title = The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD9 cell cycle checkpoint gene is required for optimal repair of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers in both G(1) and G(2)/M phases of the cell cycle | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 29 | issue = 10 | pages = 2020–5 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11353070 | pmc = 55462 | doi = 10.1093/nar/29.10.2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless, it is clear that RAD9 is necessary to sense DNA damage and halt cell division. RAD9 has been suggested to possess 3’ to 5’ exonuclease activity, which is perhaps why it plays a role in detecting DNA damage. When DNA is damaged, it is hypothesized that RAD9 forms a complex with RAD1 and HUS1, and this complex is recruited to sites of DNA damage. It is in this way that RAD9 is able to exert its effects.

Although the function of RAD9 has primarily been studied in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, many of the cell cycle control mechanisms are similar between species. Thus, we can conclude that RAD9 likely plays a critical role in the DNA damage response in humans as well.
