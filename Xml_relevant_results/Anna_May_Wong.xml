'''Anna May Wong''' (born '''Wong Liu Tsong'''; January 3, 1905&amp;nbsp;– February 3, 1961) was an American [[actress]], considered to be the first [[Chinese Americans|Chinese American]] [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] movie star,&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the first Chinese American actress to gain international recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Gan 1995, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Her varied career spanned [[silent film]], sound film, television, stage, and radio.

Born in [[Los Angeles]] to second-generation [[Taishanese people|Taishanese]] Chinese-American parents, Wong became infatuated with the movies and began acting in films at an early age. During the [[silent film]] era, she acted in ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'' (1922), one of the first movies made in color, and in [[Douglas Fairbanks]]' ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1924 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1924). Wong became a fashion icon and had achieved international stardom in 1924. Frustrated by the stereotypical supporting roles she reluctantly played in [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood]], Wong left for Europe in the late 1920s, where she starred in several notable plays and films, among them ''[[Piccadilly (film)|Piccadilly]]'' (1929). She spent the first half of the 1930s traveling between the United States and Europe for film and stage work. Wong was featured in films of the early sound era, such as ''[[Daughter of the Dragon]]'' (1931), ''[[Daughter of Shanghai]]'' (1937), and with [[Marlene Dietrich]] in [[Josef von Sternberg]]'s ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' (1932).&lt;ref&gt;Zia 1995, p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Wong was dealt the most severe disappointment of her career, when [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character [[O-Lan]] in the film version of [[Pearl S. Buck]]'s ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]'', choosing instead the white actress [[Luise Rainer]] to play the leading role. Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family's ancestral village and studying Chinese culture. In the late 1930s, she starred in several [[B movie]]s for [[Paramount Pictures]], portraying Chinese and Chinese Americans in a positive light. She paid less attention to her film career during World War II, when she devoted her time and money to help the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Chinese cause against Japan]]. Wong returned to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances.

In 1951, Wong made history with her television show ''[[The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong]]'', the first-ever U.S. television show starring an [[Asian American]] [[American TV shows with an Asian Lead|series lead]].&lt;ref name= "UCLA1"&gt;UCLA Today, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; She had been planning to return to film in ''[[Flower Drum Song (film)|Flower Drum Song]]'' when she died in 1961, at the age of 56, from a heart attack. For decades after her death, Wong was remembered principally for the stereotypical "[[Dragon Lady]]" and demure "Butterfly" roles that she was often given. Her life and career were re-evaluated in the years around the centennial of her birth, in three major literary works and film retrospectives.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Anna May Wong family 1905.jpg|thumb|Anna May Wong seated in her mother's lap, c. 1905]]
[[File:Anna May Wong holds child in The Toll of the Sea.jpg|thumb|Anna May Wong holds child in ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'']]
Anna May Wong was born Wong Liu Tsong (黄柳霜. ''Liu Tsong'' literally meaning "willow frost") on January 3, 1905, on Flower Street in [[Los Angeles]], one block north of Chinatown, in an integrated community of Chinese, Irish, German and Japanese residents.{{sfn |Hodges |2012 |pp=1, 5}}&lt;ref&gt;Corliss January 29, 2005, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the second of seven children born to Wong Sam Sing, owner of the Sam Kee Laundry, and his second wife Lee Gon Toy.&lt;ref name="Finch p.231"&gt;Finch and Rosenkrantz 1979, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong's parents were [[second generation immigrant|second-generation]] Chinese Americans; her maternal and paternal grandparents had resided in the U.S. since at least 1855.{{sfn |Hodges |2012 |p=1}} Her paternal grandfather, A Wong Wong, was a [[merchant]] who owned two stores in Michigan Hills, a gold-mining area in [[Placer County, California|Placer County]]. He had come from Chang On, a village near [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]], [[Guangdong Province]], China, in 1853.{{sfn |Hodges |2012 |p=6}} Anna May's father spent his youth traveling between the U.S. and China, where he married his first wife and fathered a son in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the U.S. in the late 1890s and in 1901, while continuing to support his family in China, he married a second wife, Anna May's mother.{{sfn |Hodges |2012 |pp=1, 7–8, 10}} Anna May's older sister Lew Ying (Lulu) was born in late 1902,{{sfn |Hodges |2012 |p=1}} and Anna May in 1905, followed by five more children.

In 1910, the family moved to a neighborhood on [[Figueroa Street]] where they were the only Chinese people on their [[City block|block]], living alongside mostly Mexican and Eastern European families. The two hills separating their new home from Chinatown helped Wong to assimilate into American culture.{{sfn |Hodges |2012 |p=5}} She attended public school with her older sister at first, but then when the girls became the target of racial taunts from other students, they moved to a [[Presbyterian]] Chinese school. Classes were taught in English, but Wong attended a [[Chinese school|Chinese language school]] afternoons and on Saturdays.{{sfn |Hodges |2012 |pp=13-14}}

About that same time, U.S. motion picture production began to relocate from the [[East Coast (U.S.)|East Coast]] to the Los Angeles area. Movies were shot constantly in and around Wong's neighborhood. She began going to [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|Nickelodeon movie theaters]] and quickly became obsessed with the "[[Film|flickers]]", missing school and using lunch money to attend the cinema. Her father was not happy with her interest in films, feeling that it interfered with her studies, but Wong decided to pursue a film career regardless. At the age of nine, she constantly begged filmmakers to give her roles, earning herself the nickname "C.C.C." or "Curious Chinese Child".{{sfn |Hodges |2012 |p=21}} By the age of 11, Wong had come up with her [[stage name]] of Anna May Wong, formed by joining both her English and family names.&lt;ref name="Wollstein, p. 248"&gt;Wollstein 1999, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
[[File:Anna May Wong as Lotus Flower calling out in The Toll of the Sea.jpg|thumb|Anna May Wong in the [[Technicolor]] film ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'' (1922)]]
Wong was working at Hollywood's Ville de Paris [[department store]] when [[Metro Pictures]] needed 300&amp;nbsp;female [[extra (actor)|extras]] to appear in [[Alla Nazimova]]'s film ''[[The Red Lantern]]'' (1919). Without her father's knowledge, a friend of his with movie connections helped her land an uncredited role as an [[Movie extra|extra]] carrying a lantern.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong worked steadily for the next two years as an extra in various movies, including [[Priscilla Dean]] and [[Colleen Moore]] pictures. While still a student, Wong came down with an illness identified as [[Sydenham's Chorea|St. Vitus's Dance]] which caused her to miss months of school. She was on the verge of emotional collapse when her father took her to a practitioner of [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. The treatments proved successful, though Wong later claimed this had more to do with her dislike of the methods.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Chinese thought such as [[Confucianism]] and particularly [[Taoism]] and the teachings of [[Laozi]] had a strong influence on Wong's personal philosophy throughout her life.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; The family's religious life also included [[Christianity|Christian]] thought, in the form of [[Presbyterianism]] and as an adult she was a [[Christian Science|Christian Scientist]] for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finding it difficult to keep up with both her schoolwork and her passion, Wong dropped out of [[Los Angeles High School]] in 1921 to pursue a full-time acting career.&lt;ref&gt;Lim 2005, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting on her decision, Wong told ''Motion Picture Magazine'' in 1931: "I was so young when I began that I knew I still had youth if I failed, so I determined to give myself 10&amp;nbsp;years to succeed as an actress."&lt;ref name="Wollstein, p. 249"&gt;Wollstein 1999, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Wong received her first [[screen credit]] for ''[[Bits of Life]]'', the first [[anthology film]], in which she played the wife of [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]]'s character, Toy Ling, in a segment entitled "Hop".&lt;ref name="Gan p. 84"&gt;Gan 1995, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; She later recalled it fondly as the only time she played the role of a mother;&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; her appearance earned her a [[cover photo]] on the British magazine ''Picture Show''.

At the age of 17, Wong played her first [[leading role]], in the early Metro [[two-color Technicolor]] movie ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]''. Written by [[Frances Marion]], the story was based loosely on ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''. [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'' magazine]] singled Wong out for praise, noting her "extraordinarily fine" acting.&lt;ref&gt;''The Toll of the Sea'' (film review) December 1, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' commented, "Miss Wong stirs in the spectator all the sympathy her part calls for and she never repels one by an excess of theatrical 'feeling'. She has a difficult role, a role that is botched nine times out of ten, but hers is the tenth performance. Completely unconscious of the camera, with a fine sense of proportion and remarkable pantomimic accuracy&amp;nbsp;... She should be seen again and often on the screen."&lt;ref&gt;''The Toll of the Sea'' (film review) November 27, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such reviews, Hollywood proved reluctant to create starring roles for Wong; her [[ethnicity]] prevented U.S. filmmakers from seeing her as a leading lady. David Schwartz, the chief curator of the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]], notes, "She built up a level of stardom in Hollywood, but Hollywood didn't know what to do with her."&lt;ref name="timeout"&gt;{{cite news| last = Anderson | first = Melissa | url = http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/film/637/the-wong-show  | title = The Wong Show | work = TimeOut: New York | issue= 544 | date= March 2–8, 2006  | access-date= 2008-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent the next few years in [[supporting role]]s providing "exotic atmosphere",&lt;ref&gt;Parish 1976, pp. 532–533.&lt;/ref&gt; for instance playing a concubine in [[Tod Browning]]'s ''[[Drifting (1923 film)|Drifting]]'' (1923).&lt;ref name="Wollstein, p. 249"/&gt; Film producers capitalized on Wong's growing fame but they relegated her to supporting roles.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Still optimistic about a film career, in 1923 Wong said: "Pictures are fine and I'm getting along all right, but it's not so bad to have the laundry back of you, so you can wait and take good parts and be independent when you're climbing."&lt;ref name="Wollstein, p. 248"/&gt;

===Stardom===
[[File:Liangyou 016 cover - Anna May Wong.png|thumb|upright|Wong on the cover of the Chinese magazine ''[[The Young Companion]]'' in June 1927]]
At the age of 19, Wong was cast in a supporting role as a scheming Mongol slave in the 1924 [[Douglas Fairbanks]] picture ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1924 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]''. Playing a stereotypical "Dragon Lady" role, her brief appearances on-screen caught the attention of audiences and critics alike.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The film grossed more than $2&amp;nbsp;million and helped introduce Wong to the public. Around this time, Wong had an affair with the director [[Tod Browning]]. It was a romance largely known of at the time: it was an [[Miscegenation|interracial relationship]] and Wong was underage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Hollywood Horror: From Gothic to Cosmic | first = Mark A. | last = Vierra | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0810945357 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/hollywoodhorrorf0000viei }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this second prominent role, Wong moved out of the family home into her own apartment. Conscious that Americans viewed her as "foreign-born" even though she was born and raised in California, Wong began cultivating a [[flapper]] image.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, pp. 37, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1924, planning to make films about [[Chinese mythology|Chinese myths]], she signed a deal creating '''Anna May Wong Productions'''; when her [[business partner]] was found to be engaging in dishonest practices, Wong brought a lawsuit against him and the company was dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

It soon became evident that Wong's career would continue to be limited by American [[anti-miscegenation laws]], which prevented her from sharing an on-screen kiss with any person of another race, even if the character was Asian, but being portrayed by a white actor.&lt;ref&gt;Leong 2005, pp. 181–82.&lt;/ref&gt; The only leading Asian man in U.S. films in the silent era was [[Sessue Hayakawa]]. Unless Asian leading men could be found, Wong could not be a [[leading lady]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong continued to be offered exotic supporting roles that followed the rising "[[Femme fatale|vamp]]" stereotype in cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Claire Love, Jen Pollack, Alison Landsberg | title = Silent Film Actresses and Their Most Popular Characters | publisher = National Women's History Museum | year = 2017 | url = https://www.womenshistory.org/articles/silent-film-actresses-and-their-most-popular-characters}}&lt;/ref&gt; She played [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous native girls]] in two 1924 films. Filmed on location in the [[Territory of Alaska]], she portrayed an [[Eskimo]] in ''[[The Alaskan (1924 film)|The Alaskan]]''. She returned to Los Angeles to perform the part of Princess [[Characters of Peter Pan#Tiger Lily|Tiger Lily]] in ''[[Peter Pan (1924 film)|Peter Pan]]''. Both films were shot by [[cinematographer]] [[James Wong Howe]]. ''Peter Pan'' was more successful, and it was the hit of the Christmas season.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bergfelder 2004, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, Wong was singled out for critical praise in a manipulative Oriental vamp role in the film [[Forty Winks (1925 film)|''Forty Winks'']].&lt;ref&gt;''Forty Winks'' (film review), February 3, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such favorable reviews, she became increasingly disappointed with her [[casting]] and began to seek other roads to success. In early 1925 she joined a group of [[serial (film)|serial]] stars on a tour of the [[vaudeville]] circuits; when the tour proved to be a failure, Wong and the rest of the group returned to Hollywood.&lt;ref name="Wollstein, p. 250"&gt;Wollstein 1999, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Wong put the first rivet into the structure of [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] when she joined [[Norma Talmadge]] for its [[groundbreaking]] ceremony, although she was not invited to leave her hand- and foot-prints in cement.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;Sweet 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, Wong starred in ''The Silk Bouquet''. Re-titled ''The Dragon Horse'' in 1927, the film was one of the first U.S. films to be produced with Chinese backing, provided by [[San Francisco]]'s [[Chinese Six Companies]]. The story was set in China during the [[Ming Dynasty]] and featured Asian actors playing the Asian roles.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong continued to be assigned supporting roles. Hollywood's Asian female characters tended toward two stereotypical poles: the naïve and self-sacrificing "Butterfly" and the sly and deceitful "Dragon Lady". In ''[[Old San Francisco (film)|Old San Francisco]]'' (1927), directed by [[Alan Crosland]] for [[Warner Brothers]], Wong played a "Dragon Lady", a gangster's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Liu 2000, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Mr. Wu]]'' (1927), she played a supporting role as increasing [[censorship]] against mixed-race onscreen couples cost her the lead. In ''[[The Crimson City]]'', released the following year, this happened again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Rohter | first = Larry | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/88185/The-Crimson-City/overview | title = The Crimson City (1928) | work = The New York Times | date = 2010-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move to Europe===
Tired of being both typecast and passed over for lead Asian character roles in favor of non-Asian actresses, Wong left Hollywood in 1928 for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Interviewed by Doris Mackie for ''[[Film Weekly]]'' in 1933, Wong complained about her Hollywood roles: "I was so tired of the parts I had to play."&lt;ref name="Leong-83-187"&gt;Leong 2005, pp. 83, 187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wollstein, p. 252"&gt;Wollstein 1999, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; She commented: "There seems little for me in Hollywood, because, rather than real Chinese, producers prefer Hungarians, Mexicans, American Indians for Chinese roles."&lt;ref&gt;Parish 1976, p. 533.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, Wong became a sensation, starring in notable films such as ''[[Song (film)|Schmutziges Geld]]'' (aka ''Song'' and ''Show Life'', 1928) and ''Großstadtschmetterling'' (''[[Pavement Butterfly]]''). Of the German critics' response to ''Song'', ''The New York Times'' reported that Wong was "acclaimed not only as an actress of transcendent talent but as a great beauty". The article noted that Germans passed over Wong's American background: "Berlin critics, who were unanimous in praise of both the star and the production, neglect to mention that Anna May is of American birth. They mention only her Chinese origins."&lt;ref&gt;''Song'' (film review). August 22, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; In Vienna, she played the title role in the [[operetta]] ''Tschun Tschi'' in fluent German.&lt;ref name="Wollstein, p. 252"/&gt; An Austrian critic wrote, "Fräulein Wong had the audience perfectly in her power and the unobtrusive tragedy of her acting was deeply moving, carrying off the difficult German-speaking part very successfully."&lt;ref&gt;Parish 1976, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Germany, Wong became an inseparable friend of the director [[Leni Riefenstahl]]. Her close friendships with several women throughout her life, including [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Cecil Cunningham]], led to rumors of [[lesbian]]ism which damaged her public reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstein 1999, pp. 252, 253, 256.&lt;/ref&gt; These rumors, in particular of her supposed relationship with Dietrich, further embarrassed Wong's family. They had long been opposed to her acting career, which was not not considered to be an entirely respectable profession at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

London producer [[Basil Dean]] bought the play ''[[A Circle of Chalk]]'' for Wong to appear in with the young [[Laurence Olivier]], her first stage performance in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Wollstein, p. 252"/&gt; Criticism of her [[California English|California accent]], described by one critic as a "Yankee squeak", led to Wong seeking vocal tutoring at [[Cambridge University]], where she trained in [[received pronunciation]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Composer [[Constant Lambert]], infatuated with the actress after having seen her in films, attended the play on its opening night and subsequently composed ''Eight Poems of Li Po'', dedicated to her.&lt;ref&gt;Motion 1986, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong made her last silent film, ''[[Piccadilly (film)|Piccadilly]]'', in 1929, the first of five English films, in which she had a starring role. The film caused a sensation in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gilda Gray]] was the top-billed actress, but ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' commented that Wong "outshines the star" and that "from the moment Miss Wong dances in the kitchen's rear, she steals 'Piccadilly' from Miss Gray."&lt;ref&gt;''Piccadilly'' (film review) July 24, 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the film presented Wong in her most sensual role in a British film, once again she was not permitted to kiss her Caucasian love interest and a controversial planned scene involving a kiss was cut before the film was released.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, pp. xiii, 213, 215, 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Forgotten for decades after its release, ''Piccadilly'' was later restored by the [[British Film Institute]].&lt;ref name="Hsu"&gt;Hsu 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's [[Richard Corliss]] calls ''Piccadilly'' Wong's best film,&lt;ref&gt;Corliss January 29, 2005, pp. 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Guardian]]'' reports that the rediscovery of this film and Wong's performance in it has been responsible for a restoration of the actress' reputation.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

While in London, Wong was romantically linked with writer and broadcasting executive [[Eric Maschwitz]], who possibly wrote the lyrics to "[[These Foolish Things (Remind Me of You)]]" as an evocation of his longing for her after they parted.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Wong's first [[talkie]] was ''[[The Flame of Love]]'' (1930), which she recorded in French, English, and German. Though Wong's performance⁠—particularly her handling of the three languages⁠—was lauded, all three versions of the film received negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, pp. 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Hollywood===
[[File:Anna May Wong by Carl Van Vechten, 1932.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Anna May Wong by Carl Van Vechten, 1932]]
During the 1930s, American studios were looking for fresh European talent. Ironically, Wong caught their eye, and she was offered a contract with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]] in 1930. Enticed by the promise of lead roles and top billing, she returned to the United States. The prestige and training she had gained during her years in Europe led to a starring role on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''On the Spot'',&lt;ref&gt;Lim 2005, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; a drama that ran for 167&amp;nbsp;performances and which she would later film as ''[[Dangerous to Know]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; When the play's director wanted Wong to use stereotypical Japanese mannerisms, derived from ''Madame Butterfly'', in her performance of a Chinese character, Wong refused. She instead used her knowledge of Chinese style and gestures to imbue the character with a greater degree of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Lim 2005, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Following her return to Hollywood in 1930, Wong repeatedly turned to the stage and [[cabaret]] for a creative outlet.

In November 1930, Wong's mother was struck and killed by an automobile in front of the [[Figueroa Street]] house.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; The family remained at the house until 1934 when Wong's father returned to his hometown in China with Anna May's younger brothers and sister.&lt;ref name="Chan-90"&gt;Chan 2003, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Anna May had been paying for the education of her younger siblings, who put their education to work after they relocated to China.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the family left, Wong's father wrote a brief article for ''Xinning'', a magazine for overseas Taishanese, in which he expressed his pride in his famous daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Poster - Daughter of the Dragon 01.jpg|thumb|Wong's role as the daughter of Fu Manchu in ''[[Daughter of the Dragon]]'' was the final stereotypical role she played.]]
With the promise of appearing in a [[Josef von Sternberg]] film, Wong accepted another stereotypical role&amp;nbsp;– the title character of [[Fu Manchu]]'s vengeful daughter in ''[[Daughter of the Dragon]]'' (1931).&lt;ref name="Wollstein, p.253"&gt;Wollstein 1999, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last stereotypically "evil Chinese" role Wong played,&lt;ref&gt;Lim 2005, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; and also her one starring appearance alongside the only other well-known Asian actor of the era, [[Sessue Hayakawa]]. Though she was given the starring role, this status was not reflected in her paycheck: she was paid $6,000, while Hayakawa received $10,000 and [[Warner Oland]], who is only in the film for 23&amp;nbsp;minutes, was paid $12,000.&lt;ref name="Time 2, p. 4"&gt;Corliss February 3, 2005, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong began using her newfound celebrity to make political statements: late in 1931, for example, she wrote a harsh criticism of the [[Mukden Incident]] and Japan's subsequent [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; She also became more outspoken in her advocacy for Chinese American causes and for better film roles. In a 1933 interview for ''Film Weekly'' entitled "I Protest", Wong criticized the negative stereotyping in ''Daughter of the Dragon'', saying, "Why is it that the screen Chinese is always the villain? And so crude a villain&amp;nbsp;– murderous, treacherous, a snake in the grass! We are not like that. How could we be, with a civilization that is so many times older than the West?"&lt;ref name="Leong-83-187"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lim 2005, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong appeared alongside [[Marlene Dietrich]] as a self-sacrificing [[courtesan]] in Sternberg's ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]''.&lt;ref name="Wollstein, p.253"/&gt; Her sexually charged scenes with Dietrich have been noted by many commentators and fed rumors about the relationship between the two stars.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Though contemporary reviews focused on Dietrich's acting and Sternberg's direction, film historians today judge that Wong's performance upstaged that of Dietrich.&lt;ref name="Wollstein, p.253"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lim 2005, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese press had long given Wong's career very mixed reviews, and were less than favorable to her performance in ''Shanghai Express''. A Chinese newspaper ran the headline: "Paramount Utilizes Anna May Wong to Produce Picture to Disgrace China" and continued, "Although she is deficient in artistic portrayal, she has done more than enough to disgrace the Chinese race."&lt;ref&gt;Leong 2005, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics in China believed that Wong's on-screen sexuality spread negative stereotypes of Chinese women.&lt;ref&gt;Leong 2005, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The most virulent criticism came from the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist government]], but China's [[Chinese intellectualism|intellectuals]] and liberals were not always so opposed to Wong, as demonstrated when [[Peking University]] awarded the actress an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] in 1932. Contemporary sources reported that this was probably the only time that an actor had been so honored.&lt;ref&gt;''Mein Film'' 1932, p. 333. Cited in Hodges 2004, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In both America and Europe, Wong had been seen as a fashion icon for over a decade. In 1934, the Mayfair Mannequin Society of New York voted her "The World's best-dressed woman" and in 1938 ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine named her "The World's most beautiful Chinese girl".&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlantic crossings===
After her success in Europe and a prominent role in ''Shanghai Express'', Wong's Hollywood career returned to its old pattern. Because of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Code]]'s anti-miscegenation rules, she was passed over for the leading female role in ''[[The Son-Daughter]]'' in favor of [[Helen Hayes]]. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer deemed her "too Chinese to play a Chinese" in the film,&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hays Office would not have allowed her to perform romantic scenes since the film's male lead, [[Ramón Novarro]], was not Asian.&lt;ref name="Wollstein, p.253"/&gt; Wong was scheduled to play the role of a mistress to a corrupt Chinese general in [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[The Bitter Tea of General Yen]]'' (1933), but the role went instead to [[Toshia Mori]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:AnnaMayWong2.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Van Vechten]] photographic portrait of Wong, September 22, 1935]]

Again disappointed with Hollywood, Wong returned to Britain, where she stayed for nearly three years. In addition to appearing in four films, she toured Scotland and Ireland as part of a [[vaudeville]] show. She also appeared in the [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George]] [[Silver Jubilee]] program in 1935.&lt;ref name="Gan p. 89"&gt;Gan 1995, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Her film ''[[Java Head (1934 film)|Java Head]]'' (1934), though generally considered a minor effort, was the only film in which Wong kissed the lead male character, her white husband in the film. Wong's biographer, Graham Russell Hodges, commented that this may be why the film remained one of Wong's personal favorites.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 144, 217.&lt;/ref&gt; While in London, Wong met [[Mei Lanfang]], one of the most famous stars of the [[Beijing Opera]]. She had long been interested in [[Chinese opera]] and Mei offered to instruct Wong if she ever visited China.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 150, 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the popularity of [[Pearl Buck]]'s novels, especially ''[[The Good Earth]]'', as well as growing American sympathy for China in its struggles with Japanese imperialism, opened up opportunities for more positive Chinese roles in U.S. films.&lt;ref&gt;Leong 2005, pp. 75, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Wong returned to the U.S. in June 1935 with the goal of obtaining the role of O-lan, the lead female character in MGM's film version of ''The Good Earth''. Since its publication in 1931, Wong had made known her desire to play O-lan in a film version of the book;&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 150–151.&lt;/ref&gt; and as early as 1933, Los Angeles newspapers were touting Wong as the best choice for the part.&lt;ref name="Hodges-152"&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the studio apparently never seriously considered Wong for the role because [[Paul Muni]], an actor of European descent, was to play O-lan's husband, Wang Lung, and the [[Hays Code]] prohibited portraying [[miscegenation]] on camera (although both the characters were Chinese, the actors not being of the same race risked running afoul of the Code). The Chinese government also advised the studio against casting Wong in the role. The Chinese advisor to MGM commented: "whenever she appears in a movie, the newspapers print her picture with the caption 'Anna May again loses face for China'&amp;nbsp;".&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wong, she was instead offered the part of Lotus, a deceitful [[Sing-song girls|song girl]] who helps to destroy the family and seduces the family's oldest son.&lt;ref&gt;Leong 2005, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Wong refused the role, telling MGM head of production [[Irving Thalberg]], "If you let me play O-lan, I will be very glad. But you're asking me&amp;nbsp;– with Chinese blood&amp;nbsp;– to do the only unsympathetic role in the picture featuring an all-American cast portraying Chinese characters."&lt;ref name="Hodges-152"/&gt; The role Wong hoped for went to [[Luise Rainer]], who won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Wong's sister, Mary Liu Heung Wong, appeared in the film in the role of the Little Bride.&lt;ref name="Chan-261"&gt;Chan 2003, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; MGM's refusal to consider Wong for this most high-profile of Chinese characters in U.S. film is remembered today as "one of the most notorious cases of casting discrimination in the 1930s".&lt;ref&gt;Berry 2000, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese tour and rising popularity===
After the major disappointment of losing the role in ''The Good Earth'', Wong announced plans for a year-long tour of China, to visit her father and his family in [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]].&lt;ref name="Chan-90"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Parish-536"&gt;Parish 1976, p. 536.&lt;/ref&gt; Wong's father had returned to his hometown in China with her younger brothers and sister in 1934. Aside from Mei Lanfang's offer to teach her, she wanted to learn more about the Chinese theater and through English translations to better perform some Chinese plays before international audiences.&lt;ref name="multiref1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu-29"&gt;Liu 2000, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; She told the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' on her departure, "... for a year, I shall study the land of my fathers. Perhaps upon my arrival, I shall feel like an outsider. Perhaps instead, I shall find my past life assuming a dreamlike quality of unreality."&lt;ref name="Chan-90"/&gt;

Embarking in January 1936, Wong chronicled her experiences in a series of articles printed in U.S. newspapers such as the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'',&lt;ref name="Gan p. 89"/&gt; the ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and ''[[Photoplay]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Liu 2000, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In a stopover in Tokyo on the way to Shanghai, local reporters, ever curious about her romantic life, asked if she had marriage plans, to which Wong replied, "No, I am wedded to my art." The following day, however, Japanese newspapers reported that Wong was married to a wealthy Cantonese man named Art.&lt;ref name="Gan p. 89"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

During her travels in China, Wong continued to be strongly criticized by the Nationalist government and the film community.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; She had difficulty communicating in many areas of China because she was raised with the [[Taishan dialect]] rather than [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. She later commented that some of the [[varieties of Chinese]] sounded "as strange to me as [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]]. I thus had the strange experience of talking to my own people through an [[Language interpretation|interpreter]]."&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The toll of international celebrity on Wong's personal life manifested itself in bouts of depression and sudden anger, as well as excessive smoking and drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Feeling irritable when she disembarked in Hong Kong, Wong was uncharacteristically rude to the awaiting crowd, which then quickly turned hostile. One person shouted: "Down with Huang Liu Tsong&amp;nbsp;– the stooge that disgraces China. Don't let her go ashore." Wong began crying and a stampede ensued.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 165–167.&lt;/ref&gt; After she left for a short trip to the Philippines, the situation cooled and Wong joined her family in Hong Kong. With her father and her siblings, Wong visited his family and his first wife at the family's ancestral home near Taishan.&lt;ref name="Parish-536"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicting reports claim that she was either warmly welcomed or met with hostility by the villagers. She spent over 10&amp;nbsp;days in the family's village and sometime in neighboring villages before continuing her tour of China.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to Hollywood, Wong reflected on her year in China and her career in Hollywood: "I am convinced that I could never play in the Chinese Theatre. I have no feeling for it. It's a pretty sad situation to be rejected by Chinese because I'm 'too American' and by American producers, because they prefer other races to act Chinese parts."&lt;ref name="Parish-536"/&gt; Wong's father returned to Los Angeles in 1938.&lt;ref name="Chan-280"&gt;Chan 2003, p. 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 1930s and further work films===
[[File:Anna May Wong by Eugene Robert Richee, 1937.jpg|thumb|Photographic portrait dated November 17, 1937, by Eugene Robert Richee for Paramount Pictures. ''[[Daughter of Shanghai]]'' was released shortly after this photo was taken.]]
To complete her contract with Paramount Pictures, Wong made a string of B movies in the late 1930s. Often dismissed by critics, the films gave Wong non-stereotypical roles that were publicized in the Chinese-American press for their positive images. These smaller-budgeted films could be bolder than the higher-profile releases and Wong used this to her advantage to portray successful, professional, Chinese-American characters. Competent and proud of their Chinese heritage, these roles worked against the prevailing U.S. film portrayals of Chinese Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Lim 2005, pp. 47, 63, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the usual official Chinese condemnation of Wong's film roles, the Chinese consul to Los Angeles gave his approval to the final scripts of two of these films, ''[[Daughter of Shanghai]]'' (1937) and ''[[King of Chinatown]]'' (1939).&lt;ref&gt;Leong 2005, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anna May Wong.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Van Vechten]] photographic portrait of Wong, in costume for a dramatic adaptation of [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s ''[[Turandot]]'' at the [[Westport Country Playhouse]], August 11, 1937&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In ''Daughter of Shanghai'', Wong played the Asian-American female lead in a role that was rewritten for her as the heroine of the story, actively setting the plot into motion rather than the more passive character originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;Lim 2005, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The script was so carefully tailored for Wong that at one point it was given the working title ''Anna May Wong Story''.&lt;ref name="Liu-29"/&gt; Of this film, Wong told ''Hollywood Magazine'', "I like my part in this picture better than any I've had before&amp;nbsp;... because this picture gives Chinese a break&amp;nbsp;– we have sympathetic parts for a change! To me, that means a great deal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Leung | first = Louise | title = East Meets West | work = Hollywood Magazine | date = June 1938 | pages= 40, 55 | quote = Quoted in Leong 2005, p. 94}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' gave the film a generally positive review, commenting of its B-movie origins, "An unusually competent cast saves the film from the worst consequences of certain inevitable banalities. [The cast]&amp;nbsp;... combine with effective sets to reduce the natural odds against any pictures in the ''Daughter of Shanghai'' tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Crisler 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1937, the press carried rumors that Wong had plans to marry her male co-star in this film, childhood friend and [[Korean American|Korean-American]] actor [[Philip Ahn]].&lt;ref name="Parish-536"/&gt; Wong replied, "It would be like marrying my brother."&lt;ref name="Wollstein, p. 256"&gt;Wollstein 1999, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bosley Crowther]] was not so kind to ''[[Dangerous to Know]]'' (1938), which he called a "second-rate [[melodrama]], hardly worthy of the talents of its generally capable cast".&lt;ref&gt;Crowther 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''King of Chinatown,'' Wong played a surgeon who sacrifices a high-paying promotion in order to devote her energies to helping the Chinese fight the Japanese invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Lim 2005, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times''' [[Frank S. Nugent|Frank Nugent]] gave the film a negative review. Though he commented positively on its advocacy of the Chinese in their fight against Japan, he wrote, "...&amp;nbsp;Paramount should have spared us and its cast&amp;nbsp;... the necessity of being bothered with such folderol".&lt;ref&gt;Nugent 1939.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paramount also employed Wong as a tutor to other actors, such as [[Dorothy Lamour]] in her role as a Eurasian in ''[[Disputed Passage]]''.&lt;ref name="Parish-536"/&gt; Wong performed on radio several times, including a 1939 role as "Peony" in Pearl Buck's ''The Patriot'' on [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archive Campbell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/otr_campbellplayhouse |title=The Campbell Playhouse  |publisher=Internet Archive |accessdate=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wong's cabaret act, which included songs in Cantonese, French, English, German, Danish, Swedish, and other languages, took her from the U.S. to Europe and Australia through the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="Time 1, p. 1"&gt;Corliss January 29, 2005, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, having auctioned off her movie costumes and donated the money to Chinese aid, the Chinese Benevolent Association of California honored Wong for her work in support of Chinese refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Leong 2005, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The proceeds from the preface that she wrote in 1942 to a cookbook entitled ''New Chinese Recipes'', one of the first Chinese cookbooks, were also dedicated to United China Relief.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1939 and 1942, she made few films, instead engaging in events and appearances in support of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Chinese struggle against Japan]].

Being sick of the negative typecasting that had enveloped her throughout her American career, Wong visited Australia for more than three months in 1939. There she was the star attraction in a vaudeville show entitled 'Highlights from Hollywood' at the Tivoli Theatre in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/hindsight/anna-may-wong/4802224  | title = Oriental stardust: Anna May Wong in White Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://events.unimelb.edu.au/events/3588-anna-may-wong-s-lucky-shoes-1939-australia-through-the-eyes   | title = Anna May Wong's Lucky Shoes:1939 Australia through the eyes of an Art Deco Diva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years and 1945 film success===
Wong attended several socialite events at the [[The Mission Inn Hotel &amp; Spa|Mission Inn]] in [[Riverside, California]], in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | editor-last = Anthony | editor-first = Sharon | year = 1989 | title= Camp Haan Papers Collection | publisher = Riverside Public Library | url = https://riversideca.gov/library/history_aids_camphaan.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wong starred in ''[[Bombs over Burma]]'' (1942) and ''[[Lady from Chungking]]'' (1942), both [[anti-Japanese propaganda]] made by the [[poverty row]] studio [[Producers Releasing Corporation]]. She donated her salary for both films to United China Relief.&lt;ref name="Leong-101"&gt;Leong 2005, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lady from Chungking'' differed from the usual Hollywood war film in that the Chinese were portrayed as heroes rather than as victims rescued by Americans. Even after American characters are captured by the Japanese, the primary goal of the heroes is not to free the Americans, but to prevent the Japanese from entering the city of [[Chongqing]] (Chungking). Also, in an interesting twist, the Chinese characters are portrayed by Chinese-American actors, while the Japanese villains&amp;nbsp;– normally played by Chinese-American actors&amp;nbsp;– are acted by European Americans. The film ends with Wong making a speech for the birth of a "new China".&lt;ref name="Leong-101"/&gt; ''The Hollywood Reporter'' and ''Variety'' both gave Wong's performance in ''The Lady from Chungking'' positive reviews but commented negatively on the film's plot.

A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Wong was supportive of [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]'s campaign during the [[1952 US Presidential Election|1952 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Motion Picture and Television Magazine | date = November 1952 | page = 33 | publisher = Ideal Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life, Wong invested in real estate and owned a number of properties in Hollywood.&lt;ref name="Finch"&gt;Finch and Rosenkrantz 1979, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; She converted her home on San Vicente Boulevard in [[Santa Monica]] into four apartments that she called "Moongate Apartments".&lt;ref name="Parish-538"&gt;Parish 1976, p. 538.&lt;/ref&gt; She served as the apartment house manager from the late 1940s until 1956, when she moved in with her brother Richard on 21st Place in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]].&lt;ref&gt;Wollstein 1999, pp. 257–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Wong's father died in Los Angeles at the age of 91.&lt;ref name="Chan-280"/&gt; After a six-year absence, Wong returned to film the same year with a small role in a B movie called ''[[Impact (1949 film)|Impact]]''.&lt;ref name="Chan-78"&gt;Chan 2003, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; From August 27 to November 21, 1951, Wong starred in a detective series that was written specifically for her, the [[DuMont Television Network]] series ''[[The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong]]'',&lt;ref name="Chan-78"/&gt; in which she played the title role that used her birth name.&lt;ref name="Time 1, p. 1"/&gt; Wong's character was a dealer in [[Chinese art]] whose career involved her in detective work and international intrigue.&lt;ref&gt;Camhi 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The ten half-hour episodes aired during [[prime time]], from 9:00 to 9:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were plans for a second season, DuMont canceled the show in 1952. No copies of the show or its scripts are known to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 216–217.&lt;/ref&gt; After the completion of the series, Wong's health began to deteriorate. In late 1953 she suffered an [[internal bleeding|internal hemorrhage]], which her brother attributed to the onset of [[menopause]], her continued heavy drinking, and financial worries.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 217–218.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, Wong hosted one of the first U.S. documentaries on China narrated entirely by a Chinese American. Broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] travel series ''[[Bold Journey]]'', the program consisted of film footage from her 1936 trip to China.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Wong also did guest spots on television series such as ''[[Adventures in Paradise (TV series)|Adventures in Paradise]]'', ''[[The Barbara Stanwyck Show]]'', and ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, pp. 81, 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

For her contribution to the film industry, Anna May Wong received a star at 1708&amp;nbsp;[[Vine Street]] on the inauguration of the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Chung 2006, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; She is also depicted larger-than-life as one of the four supporting pillars of the "Gateway to Hollywood" sculpture located on the southeast corner of [[Hollywood Boulevard]] and [[La Brea Avenue]], with the actresses [[Dolores del Río]] ([[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]]), [[Dorothy Dandridge]] ([[African American]]), and [[Mae West]] ([[White American]]).&lt;ref&gt;Negra 2001, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Wong returned to film in ''[[Portrait in Black]]'', starring [[Lana Turner]]. She still found herself stereotyped, with one press release explaining her long absence from films with a supposed proverb, which was claimed to have been passed down to Wong by her father: "Don't be photographed too much or you'll lose your soul",&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; a quote that would be inserted into many of her obituaries.&lt;ref name="Time 1, p. 1"/&gt;

===Later life and death===

Wong was scheduled to play the role of Madame Liang in the film production of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Flower Drum Song (film)|Flower Drum Song]]'', but was unable to take the role due to her health issues.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 3, 1961, at the age of 56, Anna died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] as she slept at home in Santa Monica, two days after her final screen performance on television's ''[[The Barbara Stanwyck Show]]''. Her cremated remains were interred in her mother's grave at [[Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery|Rosedale Cemetery]] in Los Angeles. The headstone is marked with her mother's Anglicized name on top, the Chinese names of Anna May (on the right), and her sister Mary (on the left) along the sides.

Wong's image and career have left a notable legacy. Through her films, public appearances and prominent magazine features, she helped to humanize Chinese Americans to white audiences during a period of intense racism and discrimination. Chinese Americans had been viewed as perpetually foreign in U.S. society, but Wong's films and public image established her as a Chinese-American citizen at a time when laws discriminated against Chinese immigration and citizenship. Wong's hybrid image dispelled contemporary notions that the East and West were inherently different.&lt;ref&gt;Lim 2005, pp. 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Wong's films, only ''Shanghai Express'' retained critical attention in the U.S. in the decades after her death. In Europe and especially England, her films appeared occasionally at festivals. Wong remained popular with the gay community who often claimed her as one of their own and for whom her marginalization by the mainstream became a symbol.&lt;ref name="Hodges-232"&gt;Hodges 2004, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Chinese Nationalist criticism of her portrayals of the "Dragon Lady" and "Butterfly" stereotypes lingered, she was forgotten in China.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges 2004, pp. 231–232.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the importance of Wong's legacy within the Asian-American film community can be seen in the Anna May Wong Award of Excellence, which is given yearly at the Asian-American Arts Awards;&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; the annual award given out by the Asian Fashion Designers was also named after Wong in 1973.&lt;ref name="Hodges-232"/&gt;

For decades following her death, Wong's image remained as a symbol in literature as well as in the film. In the 1971 poem "The Death of Anna May Wong", [[Jessica Hagedorn]] saw Wong's career as one of "tragic glamour" and portrayed the actress as a "fragile maternal presence, an Asian-American woman who managed to 'birth' however ambivalently, Asian-American screen women in the jazz age".&lt;ref&gt;Liu 2000, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Wong's character in ''Shanghai Express'' was the subject of [[John Yau]]'s 1989 poem "No One Ever Tried to Kiss Anna May Wong", which interprets the actress' career as a series of tragic romances.&lt;ref&gt;Liu 2000, pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sally Wen Mao]] wrote a book called Oculus, published in 2019, with a series of persona poems in the voice of Anna May Wong. In [[David Cronenberg]]'s [[M. Butterfly (film)|1993 film version]] of [[David Henry Hwang]]'s 1986 play, ''[[M. Butterfly]]'', Wong's image was used briefly as a symbol of a "tragic diva".&lt;ref&gt;Liu 2000, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Her life was the subject of ''China Doll, The Imagined Life of an American Actress'', an award-winning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ACTF: The David Mark Cohen National Playwriting Award | url = http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/actf/actfcohen.html |access-date=2008-05-12 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080512034812/http://www.kennedy-center.org/education/actf/actfcohen.html | archive-date = 2008-05-12 }} ''Kennedy Center.

As the centennial of Wong's birth approached, a re-examination of her life and career took shape; three major works on the actress appeared and comprehensive retrospectives of her films were held at both the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and the [[American Museum of the Moving Image]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Hsu"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Performing Race on Screen''.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Chan's 2003 biography, ''Perpetually Cool: The Many Lives of Anna May Wong (1905–1961)'', was the first major work on Wong and was written, Chan says, "from a uniquely Asian-American perspective and sensibility".&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Philip Leibfried and Chei Mi Lane's exhaustive examination of Wong's career, ''Anna May Wong: A Complete Guide to Her Film, Stage, Radio and Television Work'' was published, as well as a second full-length biography, ''Anna May Wong: From Laundryman's Daughter to Hollywood Legend'' by Graham Russell Hodges. Though Anna May Wong's life, career, and legacy reflect many complex issues which remain decades after her death, Anthony Chan points out that her place in Asian-American cinematic history, as its first female star, is permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Chan 2003, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; An illustrated biography for children, ''Shining Star: The Anna May Wong Story'', was published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-60060-259-7  | title = Shining Star 'The Anna May Wong Story' | first=  Paula | last = Yoo | others = illustrated by Lin Wang | work = [[Publishers Weekly]] |volume = 255 | issue = 29 | date = July 2008 | page = 125 | access-date =  2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the novelist [[Peter Ho Davies]] published ''The Fortunes'', a saga of Chinese-American experiences centered around four characters, one of whom is a fictionalized Anna May Wong, imagined from childhood until her death.  In a conversation published in the 2017 paperback edition, Davies described his novel as an exploration of the Chinese-American quest for authenticity – a third way of being Chinese-American – with Anna May Wong representing an iconic example of that struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Fortunes: A Novel|last=Davies|first=Peter Ho|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (First Marine Books Edition)|year=2017|isbn=978-1328745484|location=Boston|pages=103–175, 272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 22, 2020, a [[Google Doodle]] celebrated Wong, commemorating the 97th anniversary of the day ''[[The Toll of the Sea]]'' went into general release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-anna-may-wong|title=Celebrating Anna May Wong|date=22 January 2020|accessdate=22 January 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Holcombe |first1=Madeline |date=January 22, 2020 |title=Google Doodle celebrates Anna May Wong nearly 100 years after her first leading role.

In 2020, actress [[Michelle Krusiec]] played Wong in [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]]'s [[Netflix]] drama series, ''[[Hollywood (miniseries)|Hollywood]]''. The limited series tells an [[alternate history]] of Hollywood in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Soloski|first=Alexis|date=2020-05-01|title=‘Hollywood’ Offers Alternate History, and Glimpses of a Real One|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/arts/television/hollywood-ryan-murphy-netflix.html|access-date=2020-05-02|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;
