{{Short description|Principle of using energy without compromising the needs of future generations}}

{{sustainable energy}}

'''Sustainable energy''' is the practice of using [[energy]] in a way that "meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."{{sfn | Kutscher | Milford | Kreith | 2018 | Chapter=1.1.2}}&lt;ref name=REEEP&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reeep.org/sites/default/files/Glossary%20of%20Terms%20in%20Sustainable%20Energy%20Regulation.pdf |title=Glossary of terms in sustainable energy regulation |author1=Renewable Energy |author2=Efficiency Partnership |lastauthoramp=yes |date=August 2004 |accessdate=2008-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meeting the world's needs for electricity, heating, cooling, and power for transport in a sustainable way is widely considered to be one of the greatest challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Worldwide, nearly a billion people lack [[Electrification|access to electricity]], and around 3 billion people rely on smoky fuels such as wood, charcoal or animal dung in order to cook. These and [[fossil fuel]]s are a major contributor to [[air pollution]], which causes an estimated 7 million deaths per year. Production and consumption of energy emits over 70% of human-caused [[Greenhouse-gas emissions|greenhouse gas emissions]].

Proposed [[Shared Socioeconomic Pathways|pathways]] for limiting [[global warming]] to 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C describe rapid implementation of low-emission methods of producing electricity and a shift towards more use of electricity in sectors such as transport. The pathways also include measures to reduce energy consumption; and use of [[carbon-neutral fuels]], such as [[hydrogen fuel|hydrogen]] produced by renewable electricity or with [[carbon capture and storage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Hydrogen-in-a-low-carbon-economy.pdf|title=Hydrogen in a low-carbon economy|last=[[Committee on Climate Change]]|date=November 2018|website=|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Achieving these goals will require government policies including [[carbon pricing]], energy-specific policies, and phase-out of [[Energy subsidy#Impact of fossil fuel subsidies|fossil fuel subsidies]].

When referring to methods of producing energy, the term "sustainable energy" is often used interchangeably with the term "[[renewable energy]]". In general, renewable energy sources such as [[solar energy|solar]], [[wind energy|wind]], and [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] energy are widely considered to be sustainable. However, particular renewable energy projects, such as the clearing of forests for the production of [[biofuel]]s, can lead to similar or even worse environmental damage when compared to using fossil fuel energy. There is considerable controversy over whether [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] can be considered sustainable, for example among [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.power-technology.com/features/debate-is-nuclear-clean-enough-for-the-eus-green-funding/|title=Debate: is nuclear clean enough for the EU's green funding?|date=2020-01-16|website=Power Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japanese&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=McCurry|first=Justin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/12/japan-should-scrap-nuclear-reactors-after-fukushima-says-new-environment-minister|title=Japan should scrap nuclear reactors after Fukushima, says new environment minister|date=2019-09-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-03-05|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; decision makers.

Moderate amounts of wind and solar energy, which are [[variable renewable energy|intermittent]] energy sources, can be integrated into the electrical grid without additional infrastructure such as [[grid energy storage]].  These sources generated 7.5% of worldwide electricity in 2018,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://yearbook.enerdata.net/renewables/wind-solar-share-electricity-production.html|title=Wind &amp; Solar Share in Electricity Production Data {{!}} Enerdata|website=Power Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; a share that has grown rapidly. As of 2019, costs of wind, solar, and batteries are projected to continue falling.

[[File:SoSie+SoSchiff Ansicht.jpg|thumb|Buildings in the [[Solar Settlement at Schlierberg]] incorporate rooftop solar panels and are built for maximum energy efficiency. As a result, they produce more energy than they consume.]]
The concept of [[sustainable development]] was described by the [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] in its 1987 book ''[[Our Common Future]]''.{{sfn | Kutscher | Milford | Kreith | 2018 | Chapter=1.1.2}} Its definition of "sustainability", now used widely, was, "Sustainable development should meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."{{sfn | Kutscher | Milford | Kreith | 2018 | Chapter=1.1.2}}

In its book, the Commission described four key elements of sustainability with respect to energy: the ability to increase the supply of energy to meet growing human needs, energy efficiency and conservation, public health and safety, and "protection of the biosphere and prevention of more localized forms of pollution."&lt;ref name="Our Common Future"&gt;{{cite book | title=Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|last= [[World Commission on Environment and Development]]| publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford New York | year=1987 | isbn=978-0-19-282080-8 | oclc=15489268 |chapter-url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm|chapter=Chapter 7: Energy: Choices for Environment and Development }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various definitions of sustainable energy have been offered since then which are also based on the three pillars of sustainable development, namely environment, economy, and society.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

*'''Environmental''' criteria include [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]], impact on [[biodiversity]], and the production of hazardous waste and toxic emissions.
*'''Economic''' criteria include the cost of energy, whether energy is delivered to users with high reliability, and effects on jobs associated with energy production.
*'''Socio-cultural''' criteria include the prevention of wars over the energy supply ([[energy security]]) and long-term availability of energy.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

The [[organizing principle]] for sustainability is [[sustainable development]], which includes the four interconnected domains: ecology, economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice| url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719

Energy production and consumption are major contributors to [[global warming|climate change]], being responsible for 72% of annual human-caused greenhouse gas emissions as of 2014. Generation of electricity and heat contributes 31% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, use of energy in transportation contributes 15%, and use of energy in manufacturing and construction contributes 12%.

As part of this report, the IPCC's working group on [[climate change mitigation]] reviewed a variety of previously-published papers that describe pathways (i.e. scenarios and portfolios of mitigation options) to stabilize the climate system through changes in energy, land use, agriculture, and other areas.

The pathways that are consistent with limiting warning to approximately 1.5{{nnbsp}}°C describe a rapid transition towards producing electricity through lower-emission methods, and increasing use of electricity instead of other fuels in sectors such as transportation.{{sfn|SR15|loc=C.2.4.2.2}} These pathways have the following characteristics (unless otherwise stated, the following values are the median across all pathways):

*'''Renewable energy:''' The proportion of [[primary energy]] supplied by renewables increases from 15% in 2020 to 60% in 2050.{{sfn|SR15 |loc=C.2.4.2.1, Table 2.6 low-OS}} The proportion of primary energy supplied by biomass increases from 10% to 27%,{{sfn|SR15 |loc=2.4.2.1, Table 2.6 low-OS}} with effective controls on whether land use is changed in the growing of biomass.{{sfn|SR15 |p=111}} The proportion from wind and solar increases from 1.8% to 21%.{{sfn|SR15 |loc=2.4.2.1, Table 2.6 low-OS}}
*'''Nuclear energy:''' The proportion of primary energy supplied by nuclear power increases from 2.1% in 2020 to 4% in 2050. Most pathways describe an increase in use of nuclear power, but some describe a decrease. The reason for the wide range of possibilities is that deployment of nuclear energy "can be constrained by societal preferences."{{sfn|SR15|loc=2.4.2.1}}
*'''Coal and oil:''' Between 2020 and 2050, the proportion of primary energy from coal declines from 26% to 5%, and the proportion from oil declines from 35% to 13%.{{sfn|SR15|loc=2.4.2.1, Table 2.6 low-OS}}
*'''Natural gas:''' In most pathways, the proportion of primary energy supplied by natural gas decreases, but in some pathways, it increases. Using the median values across all pathways, the proportion of primary energy from natural gas declines from 23% in 2020 to 13% in 2050. {{sfn|SR15|loc=2.4.2.1, Table 2.6 low-OS}}
*'''Carbon capture and storage:''' Pathways describe more use of [[carbon capture and storage]] for bioenergy and fossil fuel energy.{{sfn|SR15|loc=2.4.2.1}}
*'''Electrification:''' In 2020, around 20% of final energy use is provided by electricity. By 2050, this proportion more than doubles in most pathways.{{sfn|SR15|loc=2.4.2.2}}
*'''Energy conservation:''' Pathways describe methods to increase energy efficiency and reduce energy demand in all sectors (industry, buildings, and transport). With these measures, pathways show energy usage to remain around the same between 2010 and 2030, and increase slightly by 2050.{{sfn|SR15|loc=2.4.3}}

{{Main|Renewable energy}}

When referring to sources of energy, the terms "sustainable energy" and "renewable energy" are often used interchangeably, however particular renewable energy projects sometimes raise significant sustainability concerns. Renewable energy technologies are essential contributors to sustainable energy as they generally contribute to world [[energy security]], and reduce dependence on [[fossil fuel]] resources thus mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="IEA"&gt;International Energy Agency (2007).

===Solar power===
[[File:SolarPowerPlantSerpa.jpg|left|thumb|11 MW solar power plant near Serpa, Portugal {{Coord|38|1|51|N|7|37|22|W|}}]]
{{main|solar power}}
In 2018, solar power provided around 3% of global electricity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Solar electricity production uses [[photovoltaic]] (PV) cells to convert light into electrical current. Photovoltaic modules can be integrated into buildings or used in [[photovoltaic power stations]] connected to the electrical grid. They are especially useful for providing [[remote-area power supply|electricity to remote areas]]. Although generally warranted for 25 years it is claimed that an average solar panel will last 40 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thosesolarguys.com/how-often-do-you-have-to-replace-solar-panels/|title=How Long Do Solar Panels Last and Replacement Guide|last=admin|website=Those Solar Guys|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and almost all of it can be recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pvcycle.org/homepage/|title=Waste take-back, treatment &amp; legal compliance {{!}} PV CYCLE Association|website=pvcycle.org|access-date=2019-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, photovoltaic (PV) panels only have the ability to convert around 24% of the sunlight that hits them into electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrel.gov/pv/assets/images/efficiency-chart.png|title=NREL Photovoltaic Efficiency Chart|accessdate=2017-04-19|publisher=NREL}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this rate, solar energy still holds many challenges for widespread implementation, but steady progress has been made in reducing manufacturing cost and increasing photovoltaic efficiency. In 2008, researchers at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) developed a method to store solar energy by using it to produce hydrogen fuel from water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2008/oxygen-0731.html |title='Major discovery' from MIT primed to unleash solar revolution |accessdate=2012-04-17|publisher=MIT News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such research is targeted at addressing the obstacle that solar development faces of storing energy for use during nighttime hours when the sun is not shining.

Large national and regional research projects on [[artificial photosynthesis]] are designing [[nanotechnology]]-based systems that use solar energy to split water into hydrogen fuel&lt;ref&gt;Collings AF and Critchley C. Artificial Photosynthesis- from Basic Biology to Industrial Application. WWiley-VCH. Weinheim (2005) p xi&lt;/ref&gt; and a proposal has been made for a Global Artificial Photosynthesis project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C3EE00063J|title=Energy and environment policy case for a global project on artificial photosynthesis|journal=Energy &amp; Environmental Science|volume=6|issue=3|pages=695|year=2013|last1=Faunce|first1=Thomas A.|authorlink2=Wolfgang Lubitz|last2=Lubitz|first2=Wolfgang|last3=Rutherford|first3=A.

Research is ongoing in [[space-based solar power]], a concept in which solar panels are launched into outer space and the energy they capture is transmitted back to Earth as microwaves. A test facility for the technology is being built in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/solar-farms-space-could-be-renewable-energy-s-next-frontier-ncna967451|title=Solar farms in space could be renewable energy's next frontier|website=NBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar heating===
[[File:Solarpipe-scheme.svg|thumb|left|Sketch of a parabolic trough collector]]
[[Solar heating]] systems generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system to move the heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage and subsequent use. The systems may be used to heat domestic hot water, swimming pool water, or for space heating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/solar-water-heaters Solar water heating] energy.gov&lt;/ref&gt; The heat can also be used for industrial applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html |title=Solar assisted air-conditioning of buildings |accessdate=2012-11-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105091415/http://www.iea-shc.org/task25/index.html |archivedate=5 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many climates, a solar heating system can provide a very high percentage (20 to 80%) of domestic hot water energy. Heat can be stored through [[thermal energy storage]] technologies. For instance, the summer heat can be stored for winter heating. Similar principles are used to store winter cold for summer air conditioning.

{{main|Wind power}}

In 2018, wind power provided approximately 6% of the global electricity supply.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, it may be difficult to site wind turbines in some areas for aesthetic or environmental reasons.&lt;ref name="IEA"/&gt; A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines, and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm may also be located offshore.

After about 20 years wind turbine blades need replacing with larger blades, and research continues on how best to recycle them and how to manufacture blades which are easier to recycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://recyclinginternational.com/editors-top-picks/critical-question-how-to-recycle-12-000-wind-turbines/26883/|title=Critical question: How to recycle 12 000 wind turbines? • Recycling International|date=2019-07-12|website=Recycling International|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nishidaira Dam.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric dams]] are one of the most widely deployed sources of sustainable energy.]]
Among sources of renewable energy, hydroelectric plants have the advantages of being long-lived—many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years. Also, hydroelectric plants are clean, have few emissions and can compensate for variations in wind and solar power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffopperman/2020/01/14/moving-to-the-system-scale-can-improve-hydropower/|title=Moving To The System Scale Can Improve Hydropower|last=Opperman|first=Jeff|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms directed at large-scale hydroelectric plants include: dislocation of people living where the reservoirs are planned, and release of [[greenhouse gas]]es during construction and flooding of the reservoir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Almeida|first=Rafael M.|last2=Shi|first2=Qinru|last3=Gomes-Selman|first3=Jonathan M.|last4=Wu|first4=Xiaojian|last5=Xue|first5=Yexiang|last6=Angarita|first6=Hector|last7=Barros|first7=Nathan|last8=Forsberg|first8=Bruce R.|last9=García-Villacorta|first9=Roosevelt|last10=Hamilton|first10=Stephen K.|last11=Melack|first11=John M.|date=2019-09-19|title=Reducing greenhouse gas emissions of Amazon hydropower with strategic dam planning|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=4281|doi=10.1038/s41467-019-12179-5|pmid=31537792|pmc=6753097|issn=2041-1723|bibcode=2019NatCo..10.4281A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biomass]] is biological material derived from living, or recently living organisms. As an energy source, biomass can either be burned to produce heat and to generate electricity or converted to modern [[biofuels]] such as [[biodiesel]] and [[ethanol]].

Biomass is extremely versatile and one of the most-used sources of renewable energy. It is available in many countries, which makes it attractive for reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels. If the production of biomass is well-managed, [[carbon emissions]] can be significantly offset by the absorption of carbon dioxide by the plants during their lifespans. However this "carbon debt" may be paid back too late, or (especially in the United States) not properly accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/3/4/18216045/renewable-energy-wood-pellets-biomass|title=Europe's renewable energy policy is built on burning American trees|last=Elbein|first=Saul|date=2019-03-04|website=Vox|language=en|access-date=2020-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the biomass source is agricultural or municipal waste, burning it or converting it into [[biogas]] also provides a way to dispose of this waste.{{sfn|Tester|2012|p=512}} Bioenergy production can be [[Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage|combined with carbon capture and storage]] to create a zero-carbon or negative-carbon system, but it is doubtful this can be scaled up quickly enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/10/drax-owner-plans-worlds-first-carbon-negative-business|title=Drax owner plans to be world's first carbon-negative business|last=Ambrose|first=Jillian|date=2019-12-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-01|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If biomass is harvested from crops, such as tree plantations, the cultivation of these crops can [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry|displace natural ecosystems]], [[soil degradation|degrade soils]], and consume water resources and synthetic fertilizers.{{sfn|Tester|2012|p=512}}{{sfn|Smil|2017a|p=162}} In some cases, these impacts can actually result in higher overall carbon emissions compared to using petroleum-based fuels.{{sfn|Smil|2017a|p=162}}{{sfn|Edenhofer|2014|p=616}}

====Biofuels====
{{main|Biofuel}}

Biofuels are fuels, such as [[ethanol]], manufactured from various types of [[biomass]], such as corn or sugar beet. Biofuels are usually liquid and used to power transport, often blended with liquid fossil fuels such as gasoline, diesel or kerosene. {{As of|2020}} which are [[sustainable biofuel]] is [[Issues relating to biofuels|being debated]].

[[Cellulosic ethanol]] has many benefits over traditional corn based-ethanol. It does not take away or directly conflict with the food supply because it is produced from wood, grasses, or non-edible parts of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Net energy of cellulosic ethanol from switchgrass | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 2 | year = 2008 | pages = 464–469 | author1 = M.R.

Use of farmland for growing fuel can result in [[food vs. fuel|less land being available for growing food]]. Since [[photosynthesis]] is inherently inefficient, and crops also require significant amounts of energy to harvest, dry, and transport, the amount of energy produced per unit of land area is very small, in the range of 0.25 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.2 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfn | Smil | 2017a | p=161}} In the United States, [[Corn ethanol|corn-based ethanol]] has replaced less than 10% of motor gasoline use since 2011, but has consumed around 40% of the annual corn harvest in the country.{{sfn|Smil|2017a|p=162}} In Malaysia and Indonesia, the clearing of forests to produce [[palm oil]] for biodiesel has led to [[Social and environmental impact of palm oil|serious social and environmental effects]], as these forests are critical [[carbon sink]]s and habitats for endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/magazine/palm-oil-borneo-climate-catastrophe.html|title=Palm Oil Was Supposed to Help Save the Planet.

===Geothermal===
[[File:West Ford Flat Geothermal Cooling Tower.JPG|thumb|upright|One of many power plants at [[The Geysers]], a geothermal power field in northern California, with a total output of over 750 MW.]]

{{Main|Geothermal power|Geothermal heating}}
[[Geothermal energy]] is produced by tapping into the thermal energy created and stored within the earth. It arises from the radioactive decay of an isotope of potassium and other elements found in the Earth's crust.&lt;ref name="László 1981 248–249"&gt;{{cite journal|last=László|first=Erika|title=Geothermal Energy: An Old Ally|journal=Ambio|year=1981|volume=10|issue=5|pages=248–249|jstor=4312703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geothermal energy can be obtained by drilling into the ground, very similar to oil exploration, and then it is carried by a heat-transfer fluid (e.g. water, brine or steam).&lt;ref name="László 1981 248–249"/&gt; Geothermal systems that are mainly dominated by water have the potential to provide greater benefits to the system and will generate more power.&lt;ref name="Dorfman 1976 370–375"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dorfman|first=Myron H.|title=Water Required to Develop Geothermal Energy|journal=Journal (American Water Works Association)|date=July 1976|volume=68|issue=7|pages=370–375|jstor=41268497|doi=10.1002/j.1551-8833.1976.tb02435.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within these liquid-dominated systems, there are possible concerns of subsidence and contamination of ground-water resources. Therefore, protection of ground-water resources is necessary in these systems.

==Non-renewable energy sources==
===Nuclear power===
{{Main|Nuclear power debate}}

[[Nuclear power]] plants have been used since the 1950s to produce a steady supply of electricity, without creating local air pollution. In 2012, nuclear power plants in 30 countries generated 11% of global electricity.{{sfn|Bruckner|2014|p=530}} The [[IPCC]] considers nuclear power to be a low-carbon energy source, with lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions (including the mining and processing of [[uranium]]), similar to the emissions from renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2014 Annex III"&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex III: Technology - specific cost and performance parameters

 |publisher=IPCC|accessdate=2018-12-14|page=7|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable controversy over whether nuclear power can be considered sustainable, with debates revolving around the risk of [[Nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents|nuclear accidents]], the cost and construction time needed to build new plants, the generation of radioactive [[nuclear waste]], and the potential for nuclear energy to contribute to [[nuclear proliferation]]. These concerns have led to a decrease in the contribution of nuclear energy to the global electricity supply since 1993.{{sfn|Bruckner|2014|p=517}} At a global level, opposition to nuclear energy stood at 62 percent in 2011.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-the-safest-form-of-energy|title=It goes completely against what most believe, but out of all major energy sources, nuclear is the safest|website=Our World in Data|access-date=2019-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public support for nuclear energy is often low as a result of safety concerns, however for each unit of energy produced, nuclear energy is far safer than fossil fuel energy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Newer nuclear reactor designs are capable of burning [[nuclear waste]] until it is no longer (or dramatically less) dangerous, and have design features that greatly minimize the possibility of a nuclear accident. These designs have yet to be commercialized. (See: [[Molten salt reactor]]) Some forms of nuclear power can "burn" nuclear waste through a process known as [[nuclear transmutation]], such as an [[Integral Fast Reactor]]. Nuclear power plants can be more or less eliminated from their problem of nuclear waste through the use of [[nuclear reprocessing]] and newer plants such as [[Fast breeder reactor|fast breeder]] plants.

There are potentially two sources of nuclear power. [[Nuclear power|Fission]] is used in all current nuclear power plants. [[Fusion power|Fusion]] is the reaction that exists in stars, including the sun, and remains impractical for use on Earth, as fusion reactors are not yet available.

Most [[electric grid]]s were constructed for non-intermittent energy sources such as coal-fired power plants. In general, up to around 30% of the energy supplied to an electric grid can be provided by intermittent sources without requiring changes to the grid system.&lt;ref name="APS"&gt;{{cite web |last1=American Physical Society Panel on Public Affairs |title=Integrating Renewable Electricity on the Grid |url=https://www.aps.org/policy/reports/popa-reports/upload/integratingelec-exsum.pdf |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |accessdate=3 June 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=December 2019|reason=over ten years old}} However the [[International Renewable Energy Agency]] forecasts that well over half will need to be wind and solar, to limit the global rise in temperature to well below 2&amp;nbsp;°C by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2019/Jun/IRENA_G20_grid_integration_2019.pdf|title=SOLUTIONS TO INTEGRATE HIGH SHARES OF VARIABLE RENEWABLE ENERGY|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As larger amounts of solar and wind energy are integrated into the grid, it becomes necessary to make changes to the overall system to ensure that the supply of electricity is matched to demand. These changes can include the following:

* Using [[grid energy storage]] to store excess solar and wind energy and release it as needed. The most commonly used storage method is [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]], which is feasible only at locations that are next to a large hill or a deep underground mine. [[Battery (electricity)|Batteries]] are being deployed widely. Other storage technologies are used in limited situations.
* Using hydroelectricity or [[Natural gas#Power generation|natural gas generation]] to produce backup power 
* Importing electricity from other locations through long-distance [[Electric power transmission|transmission lines]], such as distributing solar power from the Sahara to Europe. 
* Reducing demand for electricity at certain times through [[energy demand management]] and use of [[smart grid]]s.

As of 2019, the cost and logistics of energy storage for large population centres is a significant challenge, although the cost of battery systems has plunged dramatically.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://insideclimatenews.org/news/20022019/100-percent-renewable-energy-battery-storage-need-worst-case-polar-vortex-wind-solar|title=100% Renewable Energy Needs Lots of Storage.

If renewable sources generate more electricity than the grid uses at a given time, the excess energy can be stored as [[hydrogen fuel]] for heating and heavy transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190327-the-tiny-islands-leading-the-way-in-hydrogen-power|title=How hydrogen is transforming these tiny Scottish islands|last=Ortiz|first=Diego Arguedas |date= |website=bbc.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency==
{{Main|Efficient use of energy}}
Moving towards energy sustainability will require changes not only in the way energy is supplied, but in the way it is used, and reducing the amount of energy required to deliver various goods or services is essential. Opportunities for improvement on the demand side of the energy equation are as rich and diverse as those on the supply side, and often offer significant economic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;InterAcademy Council (2007). [http://www.interacademycouncil.net/File.aspx?id=24548 ''Lighting the way: Toward a sustainable energy future'' p. xvii.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Efficiency slows down energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. A recent historical analysis has demonstrated that the rate of [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] improvements has generally been outpaced by the rate of growth in energy demand, which is due to continuing economic and [[population growth]]. As a result, despite energy efficiency gains, total energy use and related carbon emissions have continued to increase. Thus, given the thermodynamic and practical limits of energy efficiency improvements, slowing the growth in energy demand is essential.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 5, "In Search of Solutions: Efficiency Improvements", New Society Publishers, {{ISBN|978-0-86571-704-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed. Any serious vision of a sustainable energy economy thus requires commitments to both renewables and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (2007).

==Trends==
{{As of|2019}} fossil fuels still supply over 80% of [[world energy consumption]] and, although energy consumption per person is expected to peak in the 2020s, the use of sustainable energy is not increasing fast enough to meet the 2 degree goal of the Paris Agreement.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldenergy.org/assets/downloads/Scenarios_Report_FINAL_for_website.pdf|title=World Energy Scenarios|last=|first=|date=2019|website=World Energy Council|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2019}} forecasts for the 400 GW of nuclear power capacity, which in 2018 supplied 10% of the world's electricity, vary from an 8% decrease to a 25% increase by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-releases-new-projections-for-nuclear-power-through-2050|title=IAEA Releases New Projections for Nuclear Power Through 2050|last=|first=|date=2019-09-10|website=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2020, the [[International Energy Agency]] warned that the economic turmoil caused by the [[COVID-19 pandemic|coronavirus outbreak]] may prevent or delay companies from investing in green energy.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/coronavirus-could-weaken-climate-change-action-hit-clean-energy.html |title=Coronavirus could weaken climate change action and hit clean energy investment, researchers warn |author=Newburger, Emma |publisher=[[CNBC]] |date=13 March 2020 |accessdate=16 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://text.npr.org/s.php?sId=820268157 |title=Text-Only NPR.org : Climate Change Push Fuels Split On Coronavirus Stimulus |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iea.org/commentaries/put-clean-energy-at-the-heart-of-stimulus-plans-to-counter-the-coronavirus-crisis |title=Put clean energy at the heart of stimulus plans to counter the coronavirus crisis—Analysis |website=IEA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The outbreak could potentially spell a slowdown in the world’s clean energy transition if no action is undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/12/coronovirus-poses-threat-to-climate-action-says-watchdog |title=Coronavirus poses threat to climate action, says watchdog |website=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel switching from coal to natural gas===
On average for a given unit of energy produced, the greenhouse gas emissions of [[natural gas]] are around half the emissions of [[coal]] when used to generate electricity, and around two-thirds the emissions of coal when used to produce heat: however reducing [[Fugitive gas emissions|methane leaks]] is imperative.&lt;ref name="IEA gas"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Role of Gas: Key Findings | website=International Energy Agency | date=2019-10-04 | url=https://www.iea.org/publications/roleofgas/ | access-date=2019-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural gas also produces significantly less air pollution than coal. Building gas-fired power plants and gas pipelines is therefore promoted as a way to reduce emissions and phase out coal use, however this practice is controversial. Opponents argue that developing natural gas infrastructure will create decades of [[carbon lock-in]] and [[stranded asset]]s, and that renewables create far less emissions at comparable costs.&lt;ref name="nytimes coal fades"&gt;{{cite web | title=As Coal Fades in the U.S., Natural Gas Becomes the Climate Battleground | website=The New York Times | date=2019-06-26 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/26/climate/natural-gas-renewables-fight.html | access-date=2019-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of natural gas are around 40 times the emissions of wind energy.

===Electrification===
Despite continued [[electrification]] fossil fuels may still be providing over two thirds of world energy by 2040.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

According to the IPCC, both explicit [[carbon pricing]] and complementary energy-specific policies are necessary mechanisms to limit global warming to 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C.{{sfn|SR15 |loc=2.5.2.1}}

Energy-specific programs and regulations have historically been the mainstay of efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions.&lt;ref name="Plumer"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/climate/carbon-tax-united-nations-report-nordhaus.html|title=New U.N.

[[Carbon tax]]es are an effective way to encourage movement towards a [[low-carbon economy]], while providing a source of revenue that can be used to lower other taxes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unfccc.int/climate-action/momentum-for-change/financing-for-climate-friendly/revenue-neutral-carbon-tax|title=Revenue-Neutral Carbon Tax {{!}} Canada {{!}} UNFCCC|website=unfccc.int|access-date=2019-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to help lower-income households afford higher energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-10/how-much-does-carbon-need-to-cost-somewhere-from-20-to-27-000|title=How High Does Carbon Need to Be?

==Sustainable energy research==
{{update section|date=October 2019}}

There are numerous organizations within the academic, federal, and commercial sectors conducting large scale advanced research in the field of sustainable energy. Scientific production towards sustainable energy systems is rising exponentially, growing from about 500 English journal papers only about renewable energy in 1992 to almost 9,000 papers in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rizzi | display-authors = etal | year = 2014 | title = ''The production of scientific knowledge on renewable energies: Worldwide trends, dynamics and challenges and implications for management''. In | url = | journal = [[Renewable Energy (journal)|Renewable Energy]] | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 657–671 | doi = 10.1016/j.renene.2013.08.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydrogen===
{{Main|Hydrogen economy|Hydrogen fuel|Hydrogen storage}}
Hydrogen is a zero-emission fuel that can be produced by using [[electrolysis]] to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen can play a role in a sustainable energy system if the electricity used to produce it is generated from sustainable sources, such as wind or solar. Hydrogen can be produced when there is a surplus of intermittent renewable electricity, then stored and used to generate heat or to re-generate electricity. Hydrogen can be distributed by ship&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/8ae16d5e-1bd4-11ea-97df-cc63de1d73f4|title=Japan launches first liquid hydrogen carrier ship |last=|first=|date= |website=ft.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or through pipelines. Up to 20% can be mixed into natural gas pipelines without changing pipelines or appliances,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-50873047|title=Climate change hope for hydrogen fuel|last=Harrabin|first=Roger|date=2020-01-02|access-date=2020-01-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as hydrogen is so light this would only save 7% of emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drax.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/200207_Drax_19Q4_Report_3.pdf|title=Drax Electric Insights Quarterly – Q4 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2020}} trials are underway on how to convert a natural gas grid to 100% hydrogen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.h21.green/|title=H21|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to reduce or eliminate emissions from residential and industrial natural gas heating.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  It can be used to power vehicles that have hydrogen [[fuel cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lathia|first=Rutvik Vasudev|last2=Dobariya|first2=Kevin S.|last3=Patel|first3=Ankit|date=January 2017|title=Hydrogen Fuel Cells for Road Vehicles|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|language=en|volume=141|pages=462|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.150}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it has a low energy to volume content, it is easier to use in [[hydrogen-powered ship]]s or heavy road vehicles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energypost.eu/hydrogen-fuel-cell-trucks-can-decarbonise-heavy-transport/|title=Hydrogen Fuel Cell trucks can decarbonise heavy transport|date=2019-10-17|website=Energy Post|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; than in cars and airplanes.

As of 2018, very little of the world's supply of hydrogen is created from sustainable sources. Nearly all hydrogen is created by [[steam methane reforming]] (SMR), which results in high greenhouse gas emissions but is currently cheaper than creating hydrogen via electrolysis. Although some carbon from SMR could be captured the process can be made more sustainable by using [[autothermal reforming]] with [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies to remove most of the carbon dioxide that is emitted.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theiet.org/impact-society/sectors/energy/energy-news/transitioning-to-hydrogen-assessing-the-engineering-risks-and-uncertainties/|title=Transitioning to hydrogen: Assessing the engineering risks and uncertainties|website=www.theiet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
