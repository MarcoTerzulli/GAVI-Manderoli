"'''The Unicorn'''" is a song by [[Shel Silverstein]] that was made very popular by [[The Irish Rovers]] in 1968. It remains one of the best-known songs in the Irish Rovers' long career. It sold 8 million copies worldwide and reached #2 in the US Adult Contemporary Chart, #7 in the U.S. Hot 100,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unicorn, The Irish Rovers|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the irish rovers|chart=all}}|publisher=Billboard, 1968|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; #4 in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.100183.pdf| title=RPM Top 100 Singles - March 30, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; and #5 in [[Irish Singles Chart|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/I/Irish_Rovers.html |title=CANOE - JAM! Music - Pop Encyclopedia - Irish Rovers, The |website=Jam.canoe.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Irish Charts: All There Is To Know: Irish Rovers|url=http://www.irishcharts.ie/search/placement|publisher=Irish Recorded Music Association|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can still be heard regularly in Irish Pubs. 
The lyrics to the song also appear, printed as a poem, in Shel Silverstein's book ''[[Where the Sidewalk Ends (book)|Where the Sidewalk Ends]]''. In the original version of the song, The Irish Rovers speak half of the lyrics, as well as the part of the 4th Chorus.  The final line of the 5th verse is spoken freely without the music: "And that's why you'll never see a Unicorn to this very day". On the remakes most of the song is sung, again except for the final line, which is spoken freely without the music.&lt;ref&gt;[https://toyfantv.com/llamacorn-song/ Unicorn Song]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shel Silverstein's own version was released in 1962 on his album ''Inside Folk Songs'' (Atlantic 8072).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dmdb.org/discographies/shel.disco.html |title=Shel Silverstein Discography |website=Dmdb.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His songbook, "Dirty Feet" (TRO/Hollis Music, 1969), includes a discography saying that, along with The Irish Rovers and Silverstein's versions, "The Unicorn" had been recorded by [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]] (Decca), [[Shay Duffin]] (RCA), [[Robert Goulet]] (Columbia), Bob Turner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acousticbylines.com/performers-entertainers-musicians/bobturner.htm |title=Bands, Singers, Songwriters / Composers, Soloists, Performers, Entertainers, Musicians, M.C.s (EmCees) - Bob Turner |website=AcousticByLines |date= |accessdate=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ABC), and "Uncle Bill" (Dot). (The record "Uncle Bill Socks It To Ya"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redtelephone66.com/2012/03/uncle-bill-socks-it-to-ya-1969/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604041651/http://www.redtelephone66.com/2012/03/uncle-bill-socks-it-to-ya-1969/ |archivedate=2013-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was by Burt Wilson, imitating [[W.C. Fields]])

Will Millar of The Irish Rovers recorded another, earlier version of the song with the St. Michaels Kids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theballadeers.com/wm_d01.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914022845/http://www.theballadeers.com/wm_d01.htm |archivedate=2011-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1981 Millar opened an Irish pub in Toronto under the name The Unicorn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bardrinks.ca/featuredestablishment.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120720202147/http://www.bardrinks.ca/featuredestablishment.aspx |archivedate=2012-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sister pubs were also opened, including one at the site of [[Expo 86]] where the Irish Rovers recorded a live version of the song.

In 1968 the song was covered by Irish trio [[The Bachelors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bachelors: The Unicorn|url=http://www.discogs.com/Bachelors-The-Unicorn/release/1908618|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1968, a French version, La Licorne, was recorded by Les Compagnons de la Chanson, and Also recorded once French by Canadian girl group Les Coquettes that same year, and a German version, Bunte Papagaien und ein gr√ºnes Krokodil, was recorded by Andy Fisher.

In 1986, the song was covered by the [[Kidsongs]] Kids in their Kidsongs video "Good Night, Sleep Tight" and the sad part was left out.

In 2006, Massachusetts folk singers [[The Nields]] covered the song on their record "All Together Singing In The Kitchen," a CD geared towards their youngest fans.

Famous Australian children's band [[The Wiggles]] covered the song with Irish singer Morgan Crowley on their 2009 album The Wiggles Go Bananas!

==Description==

According to the song, the
[[unicorn]] was not a fantasy, but a creature that literally missed the boat by not boarding [[Noah's Ark|the Ark]] in time to be saved from the [[Great Flood]] described in the [[Bible]]. They are said to be the loveliest of all animals but also silly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-unicorn-6/|title=The Unicorn Poem by Shel Silverstein - Poem Hunter|date=7 April 2010|work=PoemHunter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addendum===
Andrew McKee later wrote new lyrics for [[Brobdingnagian Bards]]' album ''Songs of Ireland'' (and later for his solo album ''The Irish Bard'') explaining that unicorns were magical creatures, and as the [[Great Flood]] was in progress, they grew wings and acquired the power to fly above the waters. He concluded the rewritten refrain by writing that to find them, one should seek out, in [[James M. Barrie]]'s words from ''[[Peter Pan (novel)|Peter Pan]]'' that explained how to reach Never-Never Land, ''"the second star to the right and straight on until morning."''
