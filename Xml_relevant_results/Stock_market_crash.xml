[[File:Stock market crash (2020).svg|thumb|Stock price graph illustrating the [[2020 stock market crash]], showing a sharp drop in stock price near the end of the graph.]]
A '''stock market crash''' is a sudden dramatic decline of [[stock]] prices across a significant cross-section of a [[stock market]], resulting in a significant loss of [[paper wealth]]. Crashes are driven by panic as much as by underlying economic factors. They often follow [[speculation]] and [[economic bubble]]s. 

A stock market crash is a [[social phenomenon]] where external economic events combine with [[crowd psychology]] in a [[positive feedback]] loop where selling by some market participants drives more market participants to sell. Generally speaking, crashes usually occur under the following conditions: a prolonged period of rising stock prices (a [[Market trend#Market terminology|bull market]]) and excessive economic optimism, a market where [[price–earnings ratio]]s exceed long-term averages, and extensive use of [[Margin (economics)|margin]] debt and leverage by market participants. Other aspects such as wars, large corporate hacks, changes in federal laws and regulations, and natural disasters within economically productive areas may also influence a significant decline in the stock market value of a wide range of stocks. All such stock drops may result in the rise of stock prices for corporations competing against the affected corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith, J. ''The Great Crash 1929'', 1988 edition, Houghton Mifflin Co. Boston, p.xii-xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no numerically specific definition of a stock market crash but the term commonly applies to steep double-digit percentage losses in a [[stock market index]] over a period of several days. Crashes are often distinguished from [[Market trend#Market terminology|bear markets]] (periods of declining stock market prices that are measured in months or years) by [[panic selling]] and abrupt, dramatic price declines. Crashes are often associated with bear markets; however, they do not necessarily go hand in hand. [[Black Monday (1987)]], for example, did not lead to a bear market. Likewise, the [[Japanese asset price bubble|Japanese bear market of the 1990s]] occurred over several years without any notable crashes.

Crashes are generally unexpected. As [[Niall Ferguson]] stated, "Before the crash, our world seems almost stationary, deceptively so, balanced, at a set point. So that when the crash finally hits — as inevitably it will — everyone seems surprised. And our brains keep telling us it’s not time for a crash."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/crash-of-2014-like-1929-youll-never-hear-it-coming-2014-02-19 | title=Crash of 2014: Like 1929, you'll never hear it coming | first=Paul B. | last=Farrell | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tulip Mania]] (in the mid-1630s) is often considered to be the first recorded [[economic bubble]]. Historically, early [[stock market bubble]]s and crashes have also had their roots in socio-politico-economic activities of the 17th-century Dutch Republic (the birthplace of the world's first formal [[stock exchange]] and [[stock market]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Business_Adventures.html?id=ZMPTAwAAQBAJ | first=John | last=Brooks | authorlink=John Brooks (writer) | title=Business Adventures: Twelve Classic Tales from the World of Wall Street | publisher=Weybright &amp; Talley | date=1968| isbn=9781497638853 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oi7Osz2Ss0C | title=The Origins of Value: The Financial Innovations that Created Modern Capital Markets | first1=William N. | last1=Goetzmann | first2=K.

The title of the world's first stock market deservedly goes to that of 17-century [[Amsterdam]], where an active [[secondary market]] in [[company shares]] emerged. The two major companies were the [[Dutch East India Company]] and the [[Dutch West India Company]], founded in 1602 and 1621.

===Panic of 1907===
{{Main|Panic of 1907}}
In 1907 and in 1908, stock prices fell by nearly 50% due to a variety of factors, led by the manipulation of [[copper]] stocks by the [[Knickerbocker Trust Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/41473783 |title=AMERICAN BANKS "IN THE JUNGLE". | newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] | location=Adelaide | date=March 16, 1933 | page=8 | via=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shares of [[United Copper]] rose gradually up to October, and thereafter crashed, leading to panic.&lt;ref name=FDS-H-05&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.minneapolisfed.org/article/1988/born-of-a-panic-forming-the-fed-system | title=Born of a Panic: Forming the Fed System | publisher=[[Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FDS-H-06&gt;{{cite magazine | url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-financial-panic-of-1907-running-from-history-82176328/ | title=The Financial Panic of 1907: Running from History | last=Tucker | first=Abigail | magazine=[[Smithsonian Magazine]] | date=October 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several investment trusts and banks that had invested their money in the stock market fell and started to close down.

===Wall Street Crash of 1929===
{{Main|Wall Street Crash of 1929}}
[[File:Crowd outside nyse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Crowd gathering on [[Wall Street]] the day after the 1929 crash.]]

The economy grew for most of the [[Roaring Twenties]]. It was a technological golden age, as innovations such as the radio, automobile, aviation, telephone, and the [[electric power transmission]] grid were deployed and adopted. Companies that had pioneered these advances, including [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) and [[General Motors]], saw their stocks soar. Financial corporations also did well, as [[Wall Street]] bankers [[Public float|floated]] [[mutual fund]] companies (then known as [[investment trust]]s) like the [[Goldman Sachs]] Trading Corporation. Investors were infatuated with the returns available in the stock market, especially by the use of [[Leverage (finance)|leverage]] through margin debt.

On August 24, 1921, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (DJIA) was at 63.9. By September 3, 1929, it had risen more than sixfold, touching 381.2. It did not regain this level for another 25 years. By the summer of 1929, it was clear that the economy was contracting, and the stock market went through a series of unsettling price declines. These declines fed investor anxiety, and events came to a head on October 24, 28, and 29 (known respectively as Black Thursday, Black Monday, and Black Tuesday).

On Black Monday, the DJIA fell 38.33 points to 260, a drop of 12.8%. The deluge of selling overwhelmed the [[ticker tape]] system that normally gave investors the current prices of their shares. [[Telephone line]]s and telegraphs were clogged and were unable to cope. This information vacuum only led to more fear and panic. The technology of the New Era, previously much celebrated by investors, now served to deepen their suffering.

The following day, Black Tuesday, was a day of chaos. Forced to liquidate their stocks because of [[Margin calls|margin call]]s, overextended investors flooded the exchange with sell orders. The Dow fell 30.57 points to close at 230.07 on that day. The glamour stocks of the age saw their values plummet. Across the two days, the DJIA fell 23%.

By the end of the weekend of November 11, the index stood at 228, a cumulative drop of 40% from the September high. The markets rallied in succeeding months, but it was a temporary recovery that led unsuspecting investors into further losses. The DJIA lost 89% of its value before finally bottoming out in July 1932. The crash was followed by the [[Great Depression]], the worst [[Crisis (economic)|economic crisis]] of modern times, which plagued the stock market and Wall Street throughout the 1930s.

===October 19, 1987===
{{Main|Black Monday (1987)}}
[[Image:Black Monday Dow Jones.svg|thumb|250px|right|[[Dow Jones Industrial Average|DJIA]] (19 July 1987 through 19 January 1988).]]

The mid-1980s were a time of strong economic optimism. From August 1982 to its peak in August 1987, the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (DJIA) rose from 776 to 2722. The rise in market indices for the 19 largest markets in the world averaged 296% during this period. The average number of shares traded on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] rose from 65 million shares to 181 million shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.gao.gov/d30t5/134907.pdf | title=Preliminary Observations on the October 1987 Crash | publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] | date=January 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crash on October 19, 1987, [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]], was the climatic culmination of a market decline that had begun five days before on October 14. The DJIA fell 3.81 percent on October 14, followed by another 4.60 percent drop on Friday, October 16. On Black Monday, the DJIA plummeted 508 points, losing 22.6% of its value in one day. The [[S&amp;P 500 Index]] dropped 20.4%, falling from 282.7 to 225.06. The [[NASDAQ Composite]] lost only 11.3%, not because of restraint on the part of sellers, but because the [[NASDAQ]] [[market system]] failed. Deluged with sell orders, many stocks on the NYSE faced [[trading halt]]s and delays. Of the 2,257 NYSE-listed stocks, there were 195 trading delays and halts during the day.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. GAO op. cit. p.55&lt;/ref&gt; The NASDAQ market fared much worse. Because of its reliance on a "market making" system that allowed [[market maker]]s to withdraw from trading, liquidity in NASDAQ stocks dried up. Trading in many stocks encountered a pathological condition where the [[bid price]] for a stock exceeded the [[ask price]]. These "locked" conditions severely curtailed trading. On October 19, trading in [[Microsoft]] shares on the NASDAQ lasted a total of 54 minutes.

The crash was the greatest single-day loss that Wall Street had ever suffered in continuous trading up to that point. Between the start of trading on October 14 to the close on October 19, the DJIA lost 760 points, a decline of over 31 percent.

The 1987 Crash was a worldwide phenomenon. The [[FTSE 100 Index]] lost 10.8% on that Monday and a further 12.2% the following day. In the month of October, all major world markets declined substantially. The least affected was Austria (a fall of 11.4%) while the most affected was Hong Kong with a drop of 45.8%. Out of 23 major industrial countries, 19 had a decline greater than 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | arxiv=cond-mat/0301543 | last=Sornette | first=Didier Sornette | authorlink=Didier Sornette | title=Critical Market Crashes | journal=Physics Reports | volume=378 | issue=1 | pages=1–98 | year=2003 | doi=10.1016/S0370-1573(02)00634-8 | bibcode=2003PhR...378....1S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite fears of a repeat of the 1930s Depression, the market rallied immediately after the crash, posting a record one-day gain of 102.27 the very next day and 186.64 points on Thursday October 22. It took only two years for the Dow to recover completely; by September 1989, the market had regained all of the value it had lost in the 1987 crash. The DJIA gained six-tenths of a percent during the calendar year 1987.

No definitive conclusions have been reached on the reasons behind the 1987 Crash. Stocks had been in a multi-year bull run and market [[Price–earnings ratio]]s in the U.S. were above the post-war average. The S&amp;P 500 was trading at 23 times earnings, a postwar high and well above the average of 14.5 times earnings.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. GAO op. cit. p.37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herd behavior]] and psychological [[Feedback|feedback loops]] play a critical part in all stock market crashes but analysts have also tried to look for external triggering events. Aside from the general worries of stock market overvaluation, blame for the collapse has been apportioned to such factors as [[program trading]], [[dynamic asset allocation|portfolio insurance]] and [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], and prior news of worsening [[economic indicator]]s (i.e. a large U.S. merchandise [[balance of trade|trade deficit]] and a falling [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]], which seemed to imply future interest rate hikes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/895.html — ''What caused the Stock Market Crash of 1987?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the consequences of the 1987 Crash was the introduction of the circuit breaker or [[trading curb]] on the NYSE. Based upon the idea that a cooling off period would help dissipate investor panic, these mandatory market shutdowns are triggered whenever a large pre-defined market decline occurs during the [[trading day]].

===Crash of 2008–2009===

On September 16, 2008, failures of massive financial institutions in the United States, due primarily to exposure to packaged subprime loans and credit default swaps issued to insure these loans and their issuers, rapidly devolved into a global crisis. This resulted in a number of bank failures in Europe and sharp reductions in the value of stocks and commodities worldwide. The failure of banks in Iceland resulted in a devaluation of the [[Icelandic króna]] and threatened the government with bankruptcy. Iceland obtained an emergency loan from the [[International Monetary Fund]] in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/7738874.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Business – IMF approves $2.1bn Iceland loan|work=bbc.co.uk|date=2008-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, 15 banks failed in 2008, while several others were rescued through government intervention or acquisitions by other banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/two-banks-fold-bringing-total-to-15-failures-this-year | title=Two banks fold, bringing total to 15 failures this year | first=JOHN | last=LETZING | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=October 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 11, 2008, the head of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) warned that the world financial system was teetering on the "brink of systemic meltdown".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-financial3/imf-warns-of-financial-meltdown-idUSTRE49A36O20081011 | title=IMF warns of financial meltdown | first1=Lesley | last1=Wroughton | first2=Francois | last2=Murphy | work=[[Reuters]] | date=October 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic crisis caused countries to close their markets temporarily.

On October 8, the [[Indonesia]]n stock market halted trading, after a 10% drop in one day.

''The Times'' of London reported that the meltdown was being called the ''Crash of 2008'', and older traders were comparing it with Black Monday in 1987. The fall that week of 21% compared to a 28.3% fall 21 years earlier, but some traders were saying it was worse. "At least then it was a short, sharp, shock on one day. This has been relentless all week."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/its-irrational-fear-the-markets-will-trash-anything-that-walks-bcrqtqsfjgf | title='It's irrational fear.

From October 6–10, 2008 the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed lower in all five sessions. Volume levels were record-breaking. The DJIA fell over 1,874 points, or 18%, in its worst weekly decline ever on both a points and percentage basis. The S&amp;P 500 fell more than 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/3174151/Financial-crisis-US-stock-markets-suffer-worst-week-on-record.html | title=Financial crisis: US stock markets suffer worst week on record | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=October 10, 2008 | url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The week also set 3 top ten NYSE Group Volume Records with October 8 at #5, October 9 at #10, and October 10 at #1.

Having been suspended for three successive trading days (October 9, 10, and 13), the Icelandic stock market reopened on 14 October, with the main index, the [[OMX Iceland 15]], closing at 678.4, which was about 77% lower than the 3,004.6 at the close on October 8. This reflected that the value of the three big banks, which had formed 73.2% of the value of the OMX Iceland 15, had been set to zero.

On October 24, 2008, many of the world's stock exchanges experienced the worst declines in their history, with drops of around 10% in most indices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/indexes-fall-hard-on-bloody-friday | title=Indexes fall hard on bloody Friday | first=V. PHANI | last=KUMAR | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=October 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., the DJIA fell 3.6%, i.e. not as much as other markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/10/24/markets/markets_newyork/index.htm | title=Stocks can't shake the blues | first=Alexandra | last=Twin | work=[[CNN]] | date=October 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, both the [[United States dollar]] and [[Japanese yen]] soared against other major currencies, particularly the [[British pound]] and [[Canadian dollar]], as world investors sought safe havens. Later that day, the deputy governor of the [[Bank of England]], [[Charlie Bean (economist) | Charlie Bean]], suggested that "This is a once in a lifetime crisis, and possibly the largest financial crisis of its kind in human history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/britain-bank-bean/financial-crisis-may-be-worst-in-history-boes-bean-idUSLAC00300720081024 | title=Financial crisis may be worst in history-BoE's Bean | work=[[Reuters]] | date=October 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 6, 2009 the DJIA had dropped 54% to 6,469 (before beginning to recover) from its peak of 14,164 on October 9, 2007, over a span of 17 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKk0DwAAQBAJ | title=Evolutions in Corporate Governance: Towards an Ethical Framework for Business Conduct | first=Alison L. | last=Dempsey | publisher=[[Routledge]] | date=September 8, 2017| isbn=9781351277389 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of February 2020 stock markets around the world dropped dramatically, from the 24th of February to the 28th the FTSE 100 dropped 13% wiping £200 billion off the value of the UK's leading shares. This was the biggest downward weekly drop since the global financial crisis in 2008. On 9 March, "[[Black Monday (2020)|Black Monday]]", the FTSE fell by nearly 8%; other major European markets also opened with losses of about 8%, having followed huge falls in Asian markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51796806|title=Global shares plunge in worst day since financial crisis|date=2020-03-09|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-03-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian FTSE MIB fell 2,323.98 (11.17%), putting it in "crash territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://currency.com/features/2020/04/01/italian-stock-market|title=Bad news on the Italian stock market is not just because of coronavirus|website=Currency.com |accessdate=April 1, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The S&amp;P 500 dropped 7.60% on March 9th alongside many other averages in a global crash. On March 12, the DJIA dropped by 9.99%, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq each dropped by approximately 9.5%. Earlier that day, the major stock indexes in Britain, France, Germany and Italy all fell over 10%.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

On March 16, the DJIA dropped by 12.93% making that the largest one-point drop since 1987's Black Monday crash, surpassing the drop in the prior week, the Nasdaq also saw a large drop of 12.32%, the S&amp;P 500 fared a bit better at 11.98%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/15/traders-await-futures-open-after-fed-cuts-rates-launches-easing-program.html|title=Dow drops nearly 3,000 points, as coronavirus collapse continues; worst day since '87|last=Imbert|first=Fred|date=2020-03-15|website=CNBC|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Percentage-wise, the crash that day was between those of October 28 and 29, 1929.

==Mathematical theory==
The conventional assumption is that stock markets behave according to a random [[log-normal distribution]].&lt;ref name="ARWDWS"&gt;{{cite book | last= Malkiel | first=Burton G. | authorlink=Burton Malkiel | title=A Random Walk Down Wall Street | edition=6th | publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc. | year=1973| isbn=978-0-393-06245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among others, mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] suggested as early as 1963 that the statistics prove this assumption incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bearcave.com/bookrev/misbehavior_of_markets.html | title=The (Mis)behavior of Markets | work=bearcave.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandelbrot observed that large movements in prices (i.e. crashes) are much more common than would be predicted from a log-normal distribution. Mandelbrot and others suggested that the nature of market moves is generally much better explained using [[non-linear]] analysis and concepts of [[chaos theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://news.mit.edu/2006/father-fractals-takes-stock-market | title='Father of Fractals' takes on the stock market | first=Katharine Stoel | last=Gammon | work=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] | date=November 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been expressed in non-mathematical terms by [[George Soros]] in his discussions of what he calls reflexivity of markets and their non-linear movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/alchemyoffinance00geor_0 | url-access=registration | last=Soros | first=George | authorlink=George Soros | title=Alchemy of Finance | publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year=1988| isbn=9780671662387 }}&lt;/ref&gt; George Soros said in late October 1987, 'Mr. [[Robert Prechter]]'s reversal proved to be the crack that started the avalanche'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elliott-wave-adviser-now-aggressively-bearish-2009-11-25 | title=Short term vs. long-term | first=Mark | last=Hulbert | authorlink=Mark Hulbert | work=[[Marketwatch]] | date=November 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/13/business/13speculate.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=The Man Who Won as Others Lost | first=Landon | last=Thomas Jr | date=October 13, 2007 | url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] suggests that there is evidence that the frequency of stock market crashes follows an inverse cubic [[power law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.mit.edu/2003/powerlaw | title=Stock trade patterns could predict financial earthquakes | first=Xavier | last=Gavaix | work=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] | date=May 14, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This and other studies such as [[Didier Sornette]]'s work suggest that stock market crashes are a sign of [[self-organized criticality]] in financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Self-Organized Percolation Model for Stock Market Fluctuations | first=Didier | last=Sornette | journal=Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications | volume=271 | issue=3–4 | pages=496–506 | authorlink=Didier Sornette | date=29 June 1999| arxiv=cond-mat/9906434 | doi=10.1016/S0378-4371(99)00290-3 | bibcode=1999PhyA..271..496S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Mandelbrot proposed that instead of following a strict [[random walk]], stock price variations executed a [[Lévy flight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jnlbus/v36y1963p394.html | title=The Variation of Certain Speculative Prices | journal=The Journal of Business | first=Benoit | last=Mandelbrot | date=1 January 1963 | volume=36 | issue=[object Attr] | pages=394 | via=RePEc – IDEAS | doi=10.1086/294632}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Lévy flight is a random walk that is occasionally disrupted by large movements. In 1995, Rosario Mantegna and Gene Stanley analyzed a million records of the [[S&amp;P 500 Index]], calculating the returns over a five-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Scaling behaviour in the dynamics of an economic index | first1=Rosario N. | last1=Mantegna | first2=H. Eugene | last2=Stanley | date=6 July 1995 | journal=Nature | volume=376 | issue=6535 | pages=46–49 | doi=10.1038/376046a0 | bibcode=1995Natur.376...46M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers continue to study this theory, particularly using [[computer simulation]] of crowd behavior, and the applicability of models to reproduce crash-like phenomena.

In 2011, research at the [[New England Complex Systems Institute]] found warning signs of crashes using statistical analysis tools of [[complex systems]]. This work suggests that the panics that lead to crashes come from increased mimicry in the market. A dramatic increase in market mimicry occurred during the whole year before each market crash. When investors closely follow each other's cues, it is easier for panic to take hold and affect the market. This work is a mathematical demonstration of a significant advance warning sign of impending market crashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv | eprint=1102.2620 | title=Predicting economic market crises using measures of collective panic | first1=Dion | last1=Harmon | first2=Marcus A.

==Mitigation strategies==
One mitigation strategy has been the introduction of [[trading curb]]s, also known as "circuit breakers", which are a [[trading halt]] in the cash market and the corresponding trading halt in the derivative markets triggered by the halt in the cash market, all of which are affected based on substantial movements in a broad market indicator. Since their inception in 1987 after Black Monday, circuit breakers have been modified to prevent both speculative gains and dramatic losses within a small time frame.

===United States===
There are three thresholds, which represent different levels of decline in the [[S&amp;P 500 Index]]: 7% (Level 1), 13% (Level 2), and 20% (Level 3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/trading-info | title=Trading Information | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If Threshold Level 2 (a 13% drop) is breached before 1 pm, the market closes for two hours. If such a decline occurs between 1 pm and 2 pm, there is a one-hour pause. The market would close for the day if stocks sank to that level after 2 pm
* If Threshold Level 3 (a 20% drop) is breached, the market would close for the day, regardless of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/24/when-do-circuit-breakers-kick-in-cnbc-explains.html | title=When do circuit breakers kick in? CNBC Explains | first1=Zack | last1=Guzman | first2=Mark | last2=Koba | work=[[CNBC]] | date=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
For the [[CAC 40]] [[stock market index]] in France, daily price limits are implemented in cash and derivative markets. Securities traded on the markets are divided into three categories according to the number and volume of daily transactions. Price limits for each security vary by category. For instance, for the most liquid category, when the price movement of a security from the previous day's closing price exceeds 10%, the quotation is suspended for 15 minutes, and transactions are then resumed. If the price then goes up or down by more than 5%, transactions are again suspended for 15 minutes. The 5% threshold may apply once more before transactions are halted for the rest of the day. When such a suspension occurs, transactions on options based on the underlying security are also suspended. Further, when more than 35% of the capitalization of the CAC40 Index cannot be quoted, the calculation of the CAC40 Index is suspended and the index is replaced by a trend indicator. When less than 25% of the capitalization of the CAC40 Index can be quoted, quotations on the derivative markets are suspended for half an hour or one hour, and additional margin deposits are requested.
