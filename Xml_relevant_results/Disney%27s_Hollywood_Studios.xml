'''Disney's Hollywood Studios''' is a [[Amusement park|theme park]] at the [[Walt Disney World|Walt Disney World Resort]] in [[Bay Lake, Florida]], near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. It is owned and operated by [[The Walt Disney Company]] through its [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Parks, Experiences and Products]] division. Based on a concept by [[Marty Sklar]], Randy Bright, and [[Michael Eisner]], the park opened on May 1, 1989, as the '''Disney-MGM Studios (Theme) Park''', and was the third of four [[theme park]]s built at Walt Disney World. Spanning {{convert|135|acres}}, the park is dedicated to the imagined worlds from [[Film industry|film]], [[television]], [[Music industry|music]], and [[theatre]], drawing inspiration from the [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Golden Age]] of [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/theme-park-rangers-blog/os-bz-disney-hollywood-studios-name-change-20180207-story.html|title=Disney: Park is Hollywood Studios for 'foreseeable future'|last=Bevil|first=Dewayne|date=February 7, 2018|work=Orlando Sentinel|access-date=February 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney's Hollywood Studios was initially developed as both a theme park inspired by [[show business]] and an operating [[Film studio|production studio]], with active film and television production services, an [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|animation facility branch]], and a functioning [[backlot]]. Construction on the combined park and studio began in 1987, but was accelerated when the construction of the similarly-themed [[Universal Studios Florida]] began a few miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/13/us/nastiness-is-not-a-fantasy-in-movie-theme-park-war.html |title=Nastiness Is Not a Fantasy in Movie Theme Park War |newspaper=New York Times |date=August 13, 1989 |accessdate=July 11, 2011 |first=Jeffrey |last=Schmalz |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203043306/http://nytimes.com/1989/08/13/us/nastiness-is-not-a-fantasy-in-movie-theme-park-war.html |archivedate=December 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To increase public interest and the variety of film representation within the park, Disney entered into a [[licensing]] agreement with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], from which the park's original name was derived. The park's production facilities were removed throughout the 2000s, and many of the park's soundstages were retrofitted for newer attractions and guest use. The park's current name took effect in 2008, with the removal of the MGM-branding throughout the park. In the 2010s, the park began to distance itself from the original studio backlot intention and entered a new direction of immersive theming and attraction development inspired by Hollywood stories.

The [[Landmark|park's icon]] was originally the [[Earffel Tower]] from the park's opening until 2001 when the [[Sorcerer's Hat]]—a stylized version of the magical hat from ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''—was erected in the park's central hub. It then served as the park's icon until its removal in January 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/theme-park-rangers-blog/os-disney-hollywood-studios-big-hat-20150107-post.html|title=Disney visitors say farewell to Hollywood Studios' big hat|last1=Bevil|first1=Dewayne|date=January 7, 2015|work=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=January 7, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107232025/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/theme-park-rangers-blog/os-disney-hollywood-studios-big-hat-20150107-post.html|archivedate=January 7, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the park hosted 11.258 million guests, ranking it the fifth most-visited theme park in North America and the ninth most-visited theme park in the world.&lt;ref name="2018 Report"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Au|first1=Tsz Yin (Gigi)|last2=Chang|first2=Bet|first3=Bryan|last3=Chen|first4=Linda|last4=Cheu|first5=Lucia|last5=Fischer|first6=Marina|last6=Hoffman|first7=Olga|last7=Kondaurova|first8=Kathleen|last8=LaClair|first9=Shaojin|last9=Li|first10=Sarah|last10=Linford|first11=George|last11=Marling|first12=Erik|last12=Miller|first13=Jennie|last13=Nevin|first14=Margreet|last14=Papamichael|first15=John|last15=Robinett|first16=Judith|last16=Rubin|first17=Brian|last17=Sands|first18=William|last18=Selby|first19=Matt|last19=Timmins|first20=Feliz|last20=Ventura|first21=Chris|last21=Yoshii|title=TEA/AECOM 2018 Theme Index &amp; Museum Index: Global Attractions Attendance Report|url=http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/328_572762_190522.pdf|website=teaconnect.org|publisher=Themed Entertainment Association|accessdate=May 24, 2019|date=May 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523131129/http://www.teaconnect.org/images/files/328_572762_190522.pdf|archive-date=May 23, 2019|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{more citations needed section|date=April 2016}}
[[File:TowerOfTerror MGM.jpg|thumb|[[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|''The Twilight Zone'' Tower of Terror]] opened in 1994, as part of the park's first expansion.|left]]
A team of [[Walt Disney Imagineering|Walt Disney Imagineers]] led by [[Marty Sklar]] and Randy Bright had been given an assignment to create two new pavilions for [[Epcot]]'s Future World section. The brainstorming sessions led to [[Wonders of Life]] and [[The Great Movie Ride|Great Movie Ride]] pavilions. The latter was to look like a soundstage backdrop, with a movie theater-style entrance in the middle and would have sat between [[The Land (Disney)|the Land]] and [[Imagination! (Epcot pavilion)|Journey Into Imagination]] pavilions. When newly appointed CEO [[Michael Eisner]] saw the plans for the pavilion, he requested that, instead of placing the ride in an already existing park, it should be the anchor for a new park themed with Hollywood, entertainment, and show business.

In 1985, Disney and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] entered into a licensing contract that gave Disney worldwide rights to use the MGM brand and logo for what would become Disney-MGM Studios, which included working production facilities for films and television shows, a [[backlot]], and a satellite animation studio for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]], which began operation prior to the park's debut. In 1988, [[MGM|MGM/UA]] responded by filing a lawsuit that claimed Disney violated the agreement by operating a working movie and television studio at the resort. On May 1, 1989, the theme park opened adjacent to the production facilities, with MGM's only affiliation being the original licensing agreement that allowed Disney to use MGM's name and [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|lion logo]] in marketing, and separate contracts that allowed specific MGM content to be used in the Great Movie Ride. On opening day, the only two operating attractions were the [[Studio Backlot Tour]] and the Great Movie Ride. Several months after park opening, the "Streetmosphere" improvisational troupe was added to the park. The Streetmosphere performers, now named the Citizens of Hollywood, are the longest-running attraction at the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://themouselets.com/the-citizens-of-hollywood|title=Everything you Need to Know About the Citizens of Hollywood|date=2018-07-31|website=The Mouselets|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sombrero MGM.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Sorcerer's Hat]] stood at the park's hub between 2001 and 2015.]]

Disney later filed a countersuit, claiming that MGM/UA and MGM Grand, Inc. had conspired to violate Disney's worldwide rights to the MGM name in the theme park business and that MGM/UA would harm Disney's reputation by building its own theme park at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] hotel and casino in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. On October 23, 1992, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Curtis B. Rappe ruled that Disney had the right to continue using the Disney-MGM Studios name on film product produced at the Florida facility, and that MGM Grand had the right to build a Las Vegas theme park using the MGM name and logo as long as it did not share the same studio backlot theme as Disney's property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Disney, MGM winners at trial's end|date=October 26, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{convert|33|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[MGM Grand Adventures Theme Park]] opened in 1993 at the Las Vegas site and closed permanently in 2000. Disney was contractually prohibited from using the ''Disney-MGM Studios'' name in certain marketing contexts; in those instances, the park was called either ''The Disney Studios'' or ''Disney Studios Florida''.

In the 1990s, as the park's popularity and attendance grew, the park saw its first expansion in 1994, with the addition of Sunset Boulevard and [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|''The Twilight Zone'' Tower of Terror]] attraction. The backlot's New York streets were opened to guest access to relieve traffic and renamed as Streets of America. During that same decade, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]]'s on-site satellite studio assisted in the production of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', and ''[[The Lion King]]'', with ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch]]'' being completed entirely at the park's studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-toy-story-disney-hollywood-studios-history-20180529-story.html|title=Disney-MGM Studios moves on from Hollywood dreams to theme park reality|last=Russon|first=Gabrielle|date=June 14, 2018|work=Orlando Sentinel|access-date=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Sorcerer's Hat]]—a stylized version of the magical hat from ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''—was erected in front of the park's Chinese Theater and began to serve as the [[Landmark|park's icon]] from then onwards, displacing the [[Earffel Tower]] in that role.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2004, Disney shuttered the Florida animation unit. The backlot's Residential Street was demolished to accommodate the new location for ''[[Moteurs... Action! Stunt Show Spectacular|Lights, Motors, Action! Extreme Stunt Show]]'' in 2005. In 2007, Disney announced that Disney-MGM Studios would be rebranded as Disney's Hollywood Studios, effective January 7, 2008.&lt;ref name="wdwnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdwnews.com/ViewPressRelease.aspx?PressReleaseID%3D107616 |title=On With the (Even Bigger) Show!

In the 2010s, Disney began phasing out the park's "studio-like" attractions that headlined the park during its early years of operation. This included the closure of the park's Studio Backlot Tour, [[The American Idol Experience|American Idol Experience]], and the [[The Legend of Captain Jack Sparrow (attraction)|Legend of Captain Jack Sparrow]] attractions in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bevil|first=Dewayne|title=Hollywood Studios attractions on their way out at Disney World|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-dewayne-bevil-disney-hollywood-studios-20160324-column.html|website=orlandosentinel.com|accessdate=September 6, 2016|date=March 24, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826000152/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-dewayne-bevil-disney-hollywood-studios-20160324-column.html|archivedate=August 26, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the Sorcerer's Hat was removed and the original sightlines from Hollywood Boulevard to the park's Chinese Theatre were restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mauney|first1=Matt|title=Disney Hollywood Studios: The hat is gone|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-disney-hollywood-studios-hat-gone-story.html|accessdate=February 26, 2015|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=February 26, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226051006/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-disney-hollywood-studios-hat-gone-story.html|archivedate=February 26, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, during an annual shareholders meeting, Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] hinted at another possible name change for the park due to the changes coming in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/disneys-hollywood-studios-theme-park-to-get-new-name-1201451575/|title=Disney’s Hollywood Studios Theme Park to Get New Name|date=March 12, 2015|work=Variety|last1=Graser|first1=Marc|accessdate=March 16, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315035246/http://variety.com/2015/biz/news/disneys-hollywood-studios-theme-park-to-get-new-name-1201451575/|archivedate=March 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company denied the rumors of a name change in February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fickley-Baker|first1=Jennifer|title=Reimagining the Future of Disney’s Hollywood Studios|url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2018/02/reimagining-the-future-of-disneys-hollywood-studios-first-look-at-toy-story-lands-alien-swirling-saucers/|accessdate=February 23, 2018|work=Disney Parks Blog|date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park continued to close more studio-themed attraction; in April 2016, the majority of Streets of America—including the backlot street facades, the ''Lights, Motors, Action!

Disney's Hollywood Studios is divided into seven themed areas inspired by fantasized iterations of either existing locations found in [[Hollywood]] and [[Los Angeles]] or imagined worlds from Hollywood stories. The park's original layout featured a large [[Hidden Mickey]], which was visible in aerial photographs of the park and on the park's early guide maps, though construction and other park changes have eliminated much of this image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2011/06/vintage-walt-disney-world-sunset-boulevard-emerges/|title=Vintage Walt Disney World: Sunset Boulevard Emerges|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Nate|date=June 9, 2011|work=Disney Parks Blog|accessdate=April 9, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417161221/https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2011/06/vintage-walt-disney-world-sunset-boulevard-emerges/|archivedate=April 17, 2016|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hollywood Boulevard===
[[File:Hollywood Boulevard in Walt Disney World.jpg|thumb|Hollywood Boulevard]]

'''Hollywood Boulevard''', inspired by [[Hollywood Boulevard|the real street of the same name]], serves as the park's main entrance and operates in the same vein as [[Main Street, U.S.A.]] at [[Magic Kingdom]]. It is lined with themed streetscape facades and venues selling Disney merchandise and park services. Guests enter through the main entrance gate, which resembles the [[Pan-Pacific Auditorium]]. Near the park's gate is a recreation of the [[Crossroads of the World]] tower. Live street entertainment and seasonal parades travel down the main street throughout the day. At the far end of Hollywood Boulevard stands an exact replica of [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], which houses [[Mickey &amp; Minnie's Runaway Railway|Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway]], a [[dark ride]] themed to the world of [[Mickey Mouse]] [[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|animated shorts]]. Near the entrance of Animation Courtyard—resides The Hollywood Brown Derby restaurant, a themed replica of the original [[Brown Derby]] restaurant in [[Hollywood, California]].

===Echo Lake===
[[File:Echo Lake at Disney's Hollywood Studios.jpg|thumb|Echo Lake]]

'''Echo Lake''', inspired by [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|the similarly-named neighborhood in Los Angeles]], is designed to mimic the suburban "[[Art Deco|California Crazy]]" form of architecture from Hollywood's Golden Age and is anchored around the area's namesake lake.

Echo Lake includes three major attractions based on characters and films created by [[George Lucas]] and produced by [[Lucasfilm]]. [[Star Tours – The Adventures Continue]] is a [[3-D film|3-D]] [[motion simulator]] ride set in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe. The [[Jedi Training: Trials of the Temple]], a live-action stage show, invites children to become "[[Jedi#Padawan|padawan learners]]" and receive [[lightsaber]] training from a Jedi master. The live-action ''[[Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!]]'' re-enacts various scenes from [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]], ''while illustrating how professional film [[stunt]]s are performed.

The Hyperion Theater houses [[For the First Time in Forever: A Frozen Sing-Along Celebration|''For the First Time in Forever'': A ''Frozen'' Sing-Along Celebration]], a musical show based on Disney's 2013 animated film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''. Behind this building lies a subsection named Commissary Lane, that connects Hollywood Boulevard directly to Grand Avenue and bypasses Echo Lake altogether. In this area, resides the [[ABC Commissary]] and the [[Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater Restaurant]], a [[dinner theater]] with a retro-style theme featuring vintage car themed tables and a large movie screen featuring continuous clips of [[Sci-fi films|science-fiction films]] from the 1950s.

===Grand Avenue===
[[File:Grand Avenue and BaseLine Tap House.jpg|thumb|Grand Avenue]]

'''Grand Avenue''' is themed as a [[Gentrification|gentrified]] [[historic district]] inspired by [[Grand Avenue (Los Angeles)|the real location of the same name]] in [[downtown Los Angeles]]. The area is anchored by [[Muppet*Vision 3D]], a [[4D film|4D film attraction]] starring [[the Muppets]] from [[Jim Henson]]'s ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', that is presented at the Grand Arts Theatre within the avenue's Grand Park, itself also inspired by the [[Grand Park|real park of the same name]].

Grand Avenue was originally planned as a themed area called Muppet Studios, following Disney's acquisition of the [[Jim Henson Company]]. In addition to Muppet*Vision 3D, this area was to include a themed restaurant and a Muppet [[dark ride]] parody of [[The Great Movie Ride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Korkis|first1=Jim|title=Walt Disney World Chronicles: The Muppet Studios|url=http://allears.net/ae/issue647.htm|website=allears.net|accessdate=April 4, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416174916/http://allears.net/ae/issue647.htm|archivedate=April 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Jim|title=You will believe that a Pig can fly.

{{anchor|Streets of America}}The realized Muppet-themed section became a part of the park's former Streets of America area, which encompassed several attractions, including an [[Urban area|urban street]] amalgamation of [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]]. The area's namesake street facades were formerly the park's working [[Backlot|backlot set]], which was originally a component of the park's inaugural [[Studio Backlot Tour]], and opened to pedestrian park traffic in the mid-1990s; this area closed on April 2, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Thomas|title=Experience Lights, Motors, Action!

[[File:Disney's Hollywood Studios Archway.jpg|thumb|Animation Courtyard]]

'''Animation Courtyard''' is home to attractions based on films and characters created by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]. Its entrance is marked by a square "studio arch". This section of the park originally was the starting point for the Studio Backlot Tour.

The former [[The Magic of Disney Animation|Magic of Disney Animation]] building hosts [[Star Wars Launch Bay|''Star Wars'' Launch Bay]], a ''Star Wars'' exhibit featuring behind-the-scenes props and character meet-and-greets with [[Darth Vader]], [[Chewbacca]], and [[BB-8]].

===Sunset Boulevard===
[[File:Sunset Boulevard at Disney's Hollywood Studios.jpg|thumb|Sunset Boulevard]]

'''Sunset Boulevard''', inspired by the [[Sunset Boulevard|real thoroughfare of the same name]], was the first expansion of the park, opening in July 1994.

==Live entertainment==

Disney's Hollywood Studios has featured numerous forms of in-park entertainment throughout its history. During its early years, the park featured the "Star Today" program, with a daily celebrity guest. The celebrity would often be featured in a motorcade along Hollywood Boulevard or would take part in a [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre#Footprints|handprint]] ceremony at the Great Movie Ride's entrance, or participate in an interview session.

At other times, Disney has imported characters and [[Intellectual property|intellectual properties]] that were not part of its own original library of films and television shows. Some of these characters have included the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', ''[[Ace Ventura, Pet Detective]]'', and characters from the ''[[Goosebumps]]'' series by author [[R. L. Stine]]. The ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' made appearances in the park during the first seasons of the television series but then vanished. Disney had ownership of the Power Rangers franchise through its purchase of [[Saban Entertainment]] until May 2010 when Saban purchased the franchise back and were regular members of the park's cast of characters during that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title=Saban re-acquires rights to ‘Rangers’|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118019212.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|website=Variety|accessdate=March 14, 2017|date=May 12, 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916223604/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118019212.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|archivedate=September 16, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Live musical acts, such as the [[cover band]] Mulch, Sweat and Shears and the [[a cappella]] [[quartet]] Four For a Dollar, used to perform on the park streets or as pre-show entertainment at the larger shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://attractionsmagazine.com/mulch-sweat-shears-ending-october-10-disneys-hollywood-studios/|title=Mulch, Sweat and Shears ending at Hollywood Studios|work=Attractions Magazine|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323191044/http://attractionsmagazine.com/mulch-sweat-shears-ending-october-10-disneys-hollywood-studios/|archivedate=March 23, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Disney's Animal Kingdom, Disney's Hollywood Studios also used to run daily parades down Hollywood Boulevard. The [[Disney Stars and Motor Cars Parade]] and the [[Pixar Block Party Bash]] featured film characters performing in a street party along Hollywood Boulevard and near Echo Lake. Several times each day, the "''[[High School Musical 3 Senior Year]]'': Right Here Right Now" show used to travel Hollywood Boulevard before performing a live street show in front of the Sorcerer's Hat.

Streetmosphere performers have been present at Disney's Hollywood Studios since 1989. They are the only opening day attraction left in the park. The [[Improvisational theatre|improv]] troupe was originally called Streetmosphere, but later renamed to the Citizens of Hollywood. They perform magic, skits, and interact with guests multiple times a day on Sunset Boulevard and Hollywood Boulevard.

==Annual events==

Disney's Hollywood Studios has hosted several events during the years that often draw thousands of fans to the park.

There have also been four former events:
*[[ESPN]] The Weekend (late winter) featured commentators from the Disney-owned cable sports channels as well as sports celebrities. The event was started in 2004 and permanently cancelled in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weiner|first1=Jeff|title=No more ESPN The Weekend at Disney World|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2011-07-22/business/os-disney-espn-weekend-ends-20110722_1_walt-disney-world-resort-resort-plans-disney-parks-blog|website=articles.orlandosentinel.com|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=October 16, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022040035/http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2011-07-22/business/os-disney-espn-weekend-ends-20110722_1_walt-disney-world-resort-resort-plans-disney-parks-blog|archivedate=October 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Star Wars Weekends|''Star Wars'' Weekends]] (May–June) brought ''[[Star Wars]]'' fans and celebrities together for special park events. Running Fridays-Sundays throughout June, they featured the [[501st Legion]] (a worldwide ''Star Wars'' costuming group) parading through the park in costumes that include Stormtroopers, TIE fighter pilots, biker scouts and Rebel soldiers. Several ''Star Wars'' actors appear each weekend for photos and autographs, appearing in a variety of shows hosted in the various theatres around the park, larger [[Jedi Training Academy]] classes for younger guests, and other activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/parks/specialEvents?id=StarWarsWeekendsSpecialEventPage |title=Star Wars Weekends Page |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907070623/http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/wdw/parks/specialEvents?id=StarWarsWeekendsSpecialEventPage |archivedate=September 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Wars'' Weekends ended its run in 2015.&lt;ref name="Disney-End of SWW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Thomas|title=Disney’s Hollywood Studios to Debut New Star Wars Experiences in December|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/11/disneys-hollywood-studios-to-debut-new-star-wars-experiences-in-december/|website=disneyparks.disney.go.com|publisher=Disney Parks|accessdate=November 9, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109195658/http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2015/11/disneys-hollywood-studios-to-debut-new-star-wars-experiences-in-december/|archivedate=November 9, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sentinel-End of SWW"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pedicini|first1=Sandra|last2=Santana|first2=Marco|title=Star Wars Weekends ending at Disney's Hollywood Studios|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-disney-star-wars-weekends-20151109-story.html|website=orlandosentinel.com|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|accessdate=November 9, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109195559/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-disney-star-wars-weekends-20151109-story.html|archivedate=November 9, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}
[[File:Streets of America - DHS.jpg|thumb|The former Streets of America area was originally a working [[Backlot|backlot set]] with [[New York City]] facades and was used in several film productions. A majority of the sets were demolished in 2016.]]
The Walt Disney Company's original concept of the Disney-MGM Studios was to operate it as a television and motion picture production facility, as well as a theme park. In 1988, among the first feature-length movies filmed at the facility, prior to its completion and opening as a theme park, were ''[[Ernest Saves Christmas]]''&lt;ref name="Production-Best of"&gt;{{cite web|title=Films and Shows shot on location at Walt Disney World {{!}} BestofOrlando.com|url=https://www.bestoforlando.com/articles/films-shows-shot-on-location-disney-world/|website=www.bestoforlando.com|language=en|date=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Newsies]]''.

When the park opened in 1989, the studio/production facilities housed two major components, the first of which was [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida]], where Disney produced projects including ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'',&lt;ref name="Production-Best of" /&gt; ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch]]'',&lt;ref name="DisneyWar-Lilo"/&gt; ''[[Brother Bear]]'', and sequences from other 1990s-early 2000s Disney animated features. The second, larger component was Walt Disney Studios Florida, which consisted of three sound stages used for Disney projects including [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]]'s ''[[Mickey Mouse Club#1990s Revival|Mickey Mouse Club]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pedicini|first1=Sandra|title=Disney's Hollywood Studios: 'A park in transition'|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-disney-hollywood-studios-makeover-20141201-story.html|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Teen Win, Lose or Draw]]'' and ''[[Adventures in Wonderland]]''. Several third party productions also used the Studios, including ''[[Superboy (TV series)|Superboy]]'' (first season only, from 1988–1989), the 1988–89 season of [[MTV]]'s ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]'', ''[[Thunder in Paradise]]'', a revival of ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', special broadcasts of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]],'' airplane interior sequences for the feature film ''[[Passenger 57]], and [[The Dooley and Pals Show]].'' Music videos, several tapings for [[World Championship Wrestling]], and live broadcasts of [[WCW Monday Nitro]] were also shot there; see [[WCW Disney tapings]]. The Post Group had a Florida-based post-production facility located on the Studio lot throughout the 1990s. All these production and post-production facilities were constructed to be an integral part of the theme park's Backstage Studio Tour as well.

In 2004, Disney management (including CEO [[Michael Eisner]]) downsized Disney's Florida operations by closing the animation studio, laying off personnel and then moving the operations to the main animation studio in [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name="DisneyWar-Lilo"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stewart |first1=James B. |title=DisneyWar |date=2005 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9780743283908 |pages=472–473 |language=en |quote=Weeks later, on January 12, Disney announced that it was shutting down its Orlando animation unit, where ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch]]'' had been created.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/DisneyWar.html?id=qF5GigayEhQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q=lilo%20%26%20stitch&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Disney closes Florida studio, 258 jobs may be lost - Jan. 12, 2004 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/01/12/news/companies/disney_layoffs/ |work=CNN Money |date=January 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A radio studio is also located on the lot, behind "Sounds Dangerous".
