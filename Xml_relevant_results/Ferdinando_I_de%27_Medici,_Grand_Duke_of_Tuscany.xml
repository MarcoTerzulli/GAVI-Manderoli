'''Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany''' (30 July 1549 &amp;ndash; 3 February 1609) was [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]] from 1587 to 1609, having succeeded his older brother [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Francesco I]].

==Early life==

[[File:Ferdinand I de Medici.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Ferdinando I de' Medici as Cardinal (1562 to 1589).]]
[[File:Evangelium Sanctum Domini Nostri Jesu Christi in Arabic 1590 with Arabic types of Robert Grandjon Rome Typographia Medicea.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Evangelium Sanctum Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'' in [[Arabic]], 1590, with Arabic types of [[Robert Granjon]], ''[[Typographia Medicea]]'', [[Rome]].]]
Ferdinando was the fifth son (the third surviving at the time of his birth) of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], and [[Eleanor of Toledo]], the daughter of [[Pedro Álvarez de Toledo, Marquis of Villafranca]], the Spanish [[viceroy]] of the [[Kingdom of Naples]].

He was made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] in 1562 at the age of 14, but was never ordained into the priesthood. At [[Rome]], he proved an able administrator. He founded the [[Villa Medici]] in Rome and acquired many works of art (including the ''[[Medici lions]]''), which he then brought back to [[Florence]] with him.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Grand Duke==

When his brother [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], died in 1587, Ferdinando succeeded as grand duke at the age of 38.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In many ways, Ferdinando was the opposite of his brother who preceded him. Approachable and generous, he set out to rule mildly. He re-established the justice system and was genuinely concerned about the welfare of his subjects. During his reign, Tuscany revived and regained the independence his brother had given up.

Ferdinando fostered commerce and gained great wealth through the [[Medici bank]]s, which were established in all the major cities of Europe. He enacted an edict of tolerance for Jews and heretics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dewey.library.upenn.edu/sceti/ljs/PageLevel/view.cfm?option=view&amp;ManID=ljs379 Ferdinando I De Medici, Document Inviting Jewish Merchants to Settle in Livorno and Pisa, in Italian, Manuscript on Vellum, Florence, Italy, 10 June 1593 (fac-simile)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Livorno]] became a haven for [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|Spanish Jews]] as well as other persecuted foreigners. He established the [[Medici Oriental Press]] (''Typographia Medicea''), which published numerous books in the Arabic script.

He improved the harbor Cosimo I had built and diverted part of the flow of the [[Arno River]] into a canal called the ''Naviglio'', which aided commerce between Florence and [[Pisa]]. He fostered an irrigation project in the [[Val di Chiana]], which allowed the flatlands around Pisa and [[Fucecchio]] and in the [[Val di Nievole]] to be cultivated.

The greatest cultural achievement in Florence during Ferdinando's reign was the introduction of [[opera]] to Europe.  For the wedding of Ferdinando's niece [[Marie de' Medici]] to King [[Henry IV of France]] in 1600, his court sponsored a lavish performance of one of the first notable operas, [[Jacopo Peri]]'s ''[[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]]''.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Marriage==

For the first two years of his reign, he retained his position as cardinal, but he gave it up in order to marry  [[Christina of Lorraine]] in 1589.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/musicfeature/pip/utwg2/ BBC Radio4]&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had a large reception at the Medici Villa in [[Poggio a Caiano]]. Christina's [[dowry]] was considerably large; it included 600,000 crowns in cash as well as jewellery with a value of 50,000 crowns. Also, the rights of the [[Duchy of Urbino]] were transferred to Christina after the death of Queen [[Catherine de' Medici]] of France and thus assumed by future Medici rulers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_0YiAXoix9MC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=christina+of+lorraine+tuscany&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=DQC4TvbDL4Ow8gPSxIznBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=christina%20of%20lorraine%20tuscany&amp;f=false Strong. Roy, C. ''Art and power: Renaissance festivals, 1450-1650''. p. 129.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign policy==

[[File:Livorno, Monumento dei quattro mori a Ferdinando II (1626) - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 13-4-2006 01.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Pietro Tacca]]'s ''Monumento dei Quattro Mori'' (Monument of the Four Moors) in [[Livorno|Leghorn]], showing Ferdinando holding baton of a field marshal standing victorious above chained Moorish captives. (1623)]]
Ferdinando's foreign policy attempted to free Tuscany from Spanish domination. After the assassination of [[Henry III of France]] in 1589, he supported [[Henry IV of France]] in his struggles against the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]. Ferdinando lent Henry money and encouraged him to convert to Catholicism, which he eventually did. Ferdinando also used his influence with [[Pope Clement VIII]] to get him to accept Henry's conversion.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Henry showed no appreciation for these favors, and Ferdinando let the relationship cool, maintaining his cherished independence. He supported [[Philip III of Spain]] in his campaign in [[Algeria]] and [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II]] in his against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turk]]s. For these undertakings, he found it necessary to raise taxes on his subjects. He finally obtained the formal investiture of [[Siena]], which his father had conquered.

Ferdinando strengthened the Tuscan fleet, and it saw victories against pirates on the [[Barbary coast]] in 1607 and against a superior Turkish fleet the following year.

He also dreamed of a small African empire, and then considered the possibility of a colony in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.asei.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=180:gli-italiani-in-brasile-id-parte&amp;catid=65:articoli&amp;Itemid=250 |title=Italians in Brasil, of Matteo Sanfilippo (in Italian) |access-date=9 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720153333/http://www.asei.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=180:gli-italiani-in-brasile-id-parte&amp;catid=65:articoli&amp;Itemid=250 |archive-date=20 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferdinando organised an [[Thornton expedition|expedition in 1608]] under the command of Captain [[Robert Thornton (explorer)|Robert Thornton]] to northern [[Brazil]] and the [[Amazon river]] in order to create a colony.
