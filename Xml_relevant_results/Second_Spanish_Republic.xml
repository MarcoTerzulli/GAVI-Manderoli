The '''Spanish Republic''' ({{lang-es|link=no|República Española}}), commonly known as the '''Second Spanish Republic''' ({{lang-es|link=no|Segunda República Española}}), was the form of government that existed in Spain from 1931 to 1939. The Republic was proclaimed on 14 April 1931, after the deposition of [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], and it lost the [[Spanish Civil War]] on 1 April 1939 to the [[rebel faction]] that would establish a [[Francoist Spain|military dictatorship]] under the rule of [[Francisco Franco]].

After the proclamation of the Republic, [[Provisional Government of the Second Spanish Republic|a provisional government]] was established that lasted until December 1931, when the [[Spanish Constitution of 1931|1931 Constitution]] was approved and a Constitutional Republic was formally established. At this point once the constituent assembly had fullfilled its mandate of approving a new constitution, it should have arranged for regular parliamentary elections and adjourned. However fearing the increasing popular oppostion the Radicasl and Socialist majority postponed the regualar elections, therefore prolonging their way in power for two more years. This way the republican government of [[Manuel Azaña]] initiated numerous reforms to what in their view would "modernize" the country. In 1932 the Jesuits who were in charge of the best schools throughout the country were baned and had all their property confiscated. The army was reduced. Landowners were expropriated. Home rule was granted to Catalonia, with a local parliament and a president of its own. {{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=91}} 

After the [[Spanish general election, 1933|1933 general election]], [[Alejandro Lerroux]] ([[Radical Republican Party|Radical Party]]) formed a government with the [[confidence and supply]] of the [[Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups]] (CEDA). Under Lerroux's premiership, the Republic found itself facing an insurrection of [[anarchism|anarchists]] and socialists that took on revolutionary dimensions in [[Asturias]]. The revolt was finally suppressed by the Republic with the intervention of the army. The [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] won the [[Spanish general election, 1936|1936 general election]]. On 17–[[18 July]] [[1936]], [[Spanish coup of July 1936|a coup d'état]] fractured the [[Spanish Republican Armed Forces]], marking the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]].

During the Spanish Civil War, there were three governments. The first was led by left-wing republican [[José Giral]] (from July to September 1936); however, a [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|revolution]] inspired mostly on [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialist]], [[anarchism|anarchist]] and [[communism|communist]] principles broke within the Republic, which weakened the rule of the Republic. The second government was led by [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|socialist]] [[Francisco Largo Caballero]] of the trade union [[General Union of Workers]] (UGT). The UGT, along with the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT), were the main forces behind the aforementioned social revolution. The third government was led by socialist [[Juan Negrín]], who led the Republic until the military coup of [[Segismundo Casado]], which ended republican resistance and ultimately led to the victory of the nationalists, who established a [[military dictatorship]] under the rule of [[Francisco Franco]], known as [[Francoist Spain]].

The Republican government survived [[Spanish Republican government in exile|in exile]], and retained an embassy in [[Mexico City]] until 1976. After the restoration of democracy in Spain, the government formally dissolved the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cepc.gob.es/en/publications/journals/accesstohistoriccollectionofjournals?IDR=13&amp;IDN=1180&amp;IDA=34632 |title=Javier Rubio, ''Los reconocimientos diplomáticos del Gobierno de la República española en el exilio'' |access-date=23 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013013822/http://www.cepc.gob.es/en/publications/journals/accesstohistoriccollectionofjournals?IDR=13&amp;IDN=1180&amp;IDA=34632 |archive-date=13 October 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Spanish Constitution of 1931}}
{{See also|Background of the Spanish Civil War}}

On 28 January 1930, the military dictatorship of General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] (who had been in power since September 1923) was overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casanova|2010|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led various republican factions from a wide variety of backgrounds (including old conservatives, socialists and Catalan nationalists) to join forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casanova|2010|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pact of San Sebastián]] was the key to the transition from monarchy to republic. Republicans of all tendencies were committed to the Pact of San Sebastian in overthrowing the monarchy and establishing a republic. The restoration of the royal Bourbons was rejected by large sectors of the populace who vehemently opposed the King. The pact, signed by representatives of the main Republican forces, allowed a joint anti-monarchy political campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Mariano Ospina Peña, La II República Española, caballerosandantes.net/videoteca.php?action=verdet&amp;vid=89&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Spanish local elections, 1931|12 April 1931 municipal elections]] led to a landslide victory for republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casanova|2010|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, the Second Republic was proclaimed, and King [[Alfonso XIII]] went into exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casanova|2010|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king's departure led to a provisional government of the young republic under [[Niceto Alcalá-Zamora]]. Catholic churches and establishments in cities like [[Madrid]] and [[Sevilla]] were set ablaze on 11 May.&lt;ref name=queabc&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.es/fotos-abc/20120510/quema-iglesias-durante-segunda-98412.html |title=abc.es: "La quema de iglesias durante la Segunda República" 10 May 2012 |access-date=13 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181026005344/https://www.abc.es/fotos-abc/20120510/quema-iglesias-durante-segunda-98412.html |archive-date=26 October 2018 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== 1931 Constitution ===
In June 1931 a [[Constituent Cortes]] was elected to draft a new constitution, which came into force in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casanova|2010|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new constitution established [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of association]], extended [[suffrage]] to women in 1933, allowed divorce, and stripped the Spanish nobility of any special legal status. It also effectively disestablished the [[Roman Catholic Church]], but the disestablishment was somewhat reversed by the Cortes that same year. Its controversial articles 26 and 27 imposed stringent controls on Church property and barred religious orders from the ranks of educators.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Angel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IFuxO9NO-voC&amp;dq Historical Dictionary of Spain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624052558/https://books.google.com/books?id=IFuxO9NO-voC&amp;dq |date=24 June 2016 }}, p. 195, Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have described the constitution as hostile to religion, with one scholar characterising it as one of the most hostile of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Arguing Comparative Politics"&gt;Stepan, Alfred, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nR2tF4k1PXUC&amp;dq Arguing Comparative Politics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915012917/https://books.google.com/books?id=nR2tF4k1PXUC&amp;dq |date=15 September 2015 }}, p. 221, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Ortega y Gasset]] stated, "the article in which the Constitution legislates the actions of the Church seems highly improper to me."&lt;ref&gt;Paz, Jose Antonio Souto [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3736/is_200101/ai_n8951721/pg_4 Perspectives on religious freedom in Spain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116103213/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3736/is_200101/ai_n8951721/pg_4/ |date=16 November 2010 }} Brigham Young University Law Review 1 January 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pope Pius XI]] condemned the Spanish government's deprivation of the [[civil liberties]] of Catholics in the [[encyclical]] ''[[Dilectissima Nobis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dilectissima Nobis,  2 (On Oppression Of The Church Of Spain)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Republique-allegorie.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Allegory of Hispania|Allegory]] of the Spanish Republic, displaying [[Republicanism|republican]] paraphernalia such as the [[Phrygian cap]] and symbols of modernity]]

The legislative branch was changed to a single chamber called the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]].  The constitution established legal procedures for the [[nationalisation]] of public services and land, banks, and railways. The constitution provided generally accorded civil liberties and representation.&lt;ref name="payne 632"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne25.htm |title=A History of Spain and Portugal (Print Edition) |volume=2, Ch. 25 |page=632 |journal=University of Wisconsin Press |year=1973 |publisher=Library of Iberian resources online |accessdate=30 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190218010637/https://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne25.htm |archive-date=18 February 2019 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican Constitution also changed the country's national symbols. The ''[[Himno de Riego]]'' was established as the national anthem, and the [[Flag of the Second Spanish Republic|Tricolor]], with three horizontal red-yellow-purple fields, became the new flag of Spain. Under the new Constitution, all of Spain's regions had the right to [[autonomy]]. [[Catalonia]] (1932), the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (1936) and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (although the Galician Statute of Autonomy couldn't come into effect due to the war) exercised this right, with [[Aragon]], Andalusia and [[Valencia]], engaged in negotiations with the government before the outbreak of the Civil War. The Constitution guaranteed a wide range of civil liberties, but it opposed key beliefs of the conservative right, which was very rooted in rural areas, and desires of the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, which was stripped of schools and public subsidies.

The 1931 Constitution was formally effective from 1931 until 1939. In the summer of 1936, after the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], it became largely irrelevant after the authority of the Republic was superseded in many places by revolutionary socialists and anarchists on one side, and fascists on the other.&lt;ref name="payne 646"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne26.htm |title=A History of Spain and Portugal (Print Edition) |volume=2, Ch. 26 |pages=646–47 |journal=University of Wisconsin Press |year=1973 |publisher=Library of Iberian resources online |accessdate=15 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108082455/http://libro.uca.edu/payne2/payne26.htm |archive-date=8 November 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Azaña' government ===
With the new constitution approved in December 1931, once the constituent assembly had fulfilled its mandate of approving a new constitution, it should have arranged for regular parliamentary elections and adjourned. However fearing the increasing popular opposition the Radicals and Socialist majority postponed the regular elections, therefore prolonging their way in power for two more years. This way the republican government of [[Manuel Azaña]] initiated numerous reforms to what in their view would "modernize" the country.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=91}} 

In 1932 the Jesuits who were in charge of the best schools throughout the country were banned and had all their property confiscated. The army was reduced. Landowners were expropriated. Home rule was granted to Catalonia, with a local parliament and a president of its own. {{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=91}} Catholic churches in major cities were again subject to arson in 1932, and a revolutionary strike action was seen in [[Málaga]] the same year.&lt;ref name=queabc /&gt; A Catholic church in [[Zaragoza]] was burnt down in 1933.

In November 1932, [[Miguel de Unamuno]], one of the most respected Spanish intellectuals, rector of the University of Salamanca, and himself a Republican, publicly raised his voice to protest. In a speech delivered on November 27 1932, at the Madrid Ateneo, he protested: "Even the Inquisition was limited by certain legal guarantees. But now we have something worse: a police force which is grounded only on a general sense of panic and on the invention of non-existent dangers to cover up this over-stepping of the law."{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=93}}

In 1933, all remaining religious congregations were obliged to pay taxes and banned from industry, trade and educational activities. This ban was forced with strict police severity and widespread mob violence.{{sfn|Hayes|1951|p=92}}

== 1933–1935 period and miners' uprising ==
{{Main|Asturian miners' strike of 1934}}
{{See also|Background of the Spanish Civil War#The "two black years"}}
The majority vote in the [[Spanish general election, 1933|1933 elections]] was won by the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] (CEDA). [[José María Gil-Robles y Quiñones|José María Gil Robles]], their leader, led a coalition of centre-right and far-right parties: CEDA set up a coalition with the [[Radical Republican Party]] led by [[Alejandro Lerroux]], which had come second in the elections. The Socialists came third. With Lerroux as head of Government, the new coalition suspended most of the reforms carried out by the last government.

The inclusion of three CEDA ministers in the government that took office on 1 October 1934 led to the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934]]. Miners in Asturias occupied the capital, [[Oviedo]], killing officials and clergymen. Fifty eight religious buildings including churches, convents and part of the university at Oviedo were burned and destroyed.{{sfn|Tomas|1977}}{{sfn|Cueva|1998|pp=355-369}} The miners proceeded to occupy several other towns, most notably the large industrial centre of [[La Felguera]], and set up town assemblies, or "revolutionary committees", to govern the towns that they controlled.{{sfn|Thomas|1977}} Thirty thousand workers were mobilized for battle within ten days.{{sfn|Thomas|1977}} In the occupied areas the rebels officially declared the proletarian revolution and abolished regular money.{{sfn|Payne|1993|p=219}} The revolutionary soviets set up by the miners attempted to impose order on the areas under their control, and the moderate socialist leadership of [[Ramón González Peña]] and [[Belarmino Tomás]] took measures to restrain violence. However, a number of captured priests, businessmen and civil guards were summarily executed by the revolutionaries in [[Mieres, Asturias|Mieres]] and [[Sama, Asturias|Sama]].{{sfn|Thomas|1977}} This rebellion lasted for two weeks until it was crushed by the army, led by General [[Eduardo López Ochoa]]. This operation earned López Ochoa the nickname "Butcher of Asturias".&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain''. Norton, 2012. p 269&lt;/ref&gt; Another rebellion by the autonomous government of Catalonia, led by its president [[Lluís Companys]], was also suppressed and was followed by mass arrests and trials.

The suspension of the land reforms that had been attempted by the previous government, and the failure of the Asturias miners' uprising, led to a more radical turn by the parties of the left, especially in the PSOE (Socialist Party), where the moderate [[Indalecio Prieto]] lost ground to [[Francisco Largo Caballero]], who advocated a socialist revolution. At the same time, the involvement of the Centrist government party in the [[Straperlo]] scandal deeply weakened it, further polarising political differences between right and left. These differences became evident in the 1936 elections.

== 1936 elections ==
On 7 January 1936, [[Spanish general election, 1936|new elections]] were called. Despite significant rivalries and disagreements, the socialists, Communists, and the Catalan-and-Madrid-based left-wing Republicans decided to work together under the name [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]]. The Popular Front won the election on 16 February with 263 MPs against 156 right-wing MPs, grouped within a coalition of the ''National Front'' with CEDA, [[Carlism|Carlists]], and Monarchists. The moderate centre parties virtually disappeared; between the elections, Lerroux's group fell from the 104 representatives it had in 1934 to just 9.

American historian [[Stanley G. Payne]], one of the most prominent foreign Hispanists, thinks that the process was a major electoral fraud, with widespread violation of the laws and the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Payne |first1=Stanley G. |title=24 horas - Stanley G.

"Revisando el revisionismo. A propósito del libro 1936. Fraude y violencia en las elecciones del Frente Popular." Historia Contemporánea 3, no. 58 (2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the thirty-six hours following the election, sixteen people were killed (mostly by police officers attempting to maintain order or intervene in violent clashes) and thirty-nine were seriously injured, while fifty churches and seventy conservative political centres were attacked or set ablaze.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez Tardio, Manuel. "Mobilization and political violence following the Spanish general elections of 1936." REVISTA DE ESTUDIOS POLITICOS 177 (2017): 147-179.&lt;/ref&gt; The right had firmly believed, at all levels, that they would win. Almost immediately after the results were known, a group of monarchists asked Robles to lead a coup but he refused. He did, however, ask prime minister [[Manuel Portela Valladares]] to declare a state of war before the revolutionary masses rushed into the streets. Franco also approached Valladares to propose the declaration of martial law and calling out of the army. This was not a coup attempt but more of a "police action" akin to [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|Asturias]], as Franco believed the post-election environment could become violent and was trying to quell the perceived leftist threat.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Geoffrey. Franco. Potomac Books, Inc., 2005, p.66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beevor, Antony 1939"&gt;Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939. Hachette UK, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Brenan|1950|p=300}} Valladares resigned, even before a new government could be formed. However, the Popular Front, which had proved an effective election tool, did not translate into a Popular Front government.{{sfn|Brenan|1950|p=301}} [[Largo Caballero]] and other elements of the political left were not prepared to work with the republicans, although they did agree to support much of the proposed reforms. [[Manuel Azaña Díaz]] was called upon to form a government before the electoral process had come to an end and he would shortly replace Zamora as president taking advantage of a constitutional loophole: the Constitution allowed the Cortes to remove the President from office after two early dissolutions, and while the first (1933) dissolution had been partially justified because of the fulfillment of the Constitutional mission of the first legislature, the second one had been a simple bid to trigger early elections.{{sfn|Brenan|1950|p=301}} The right reacted as if radical communists had taken control, despite the new cabinet's moderate composition; they were shocked by the revolutionary masses taking to the streets and the release of prisoners. Convinced that the left was no longer willing to follow the rule of law and that its vision of Spain was under threat, the right abandoned the parliamentary option and began to conspire as to how to best overthrow the republic, rather than taking control of it.{{sfn|Presto|1983|p=}}&lt;ref name="Beevor, Antony 1939"/&gt;

This helped the development of the fascist-inspired [[Falange]] Española, a National party led by [[José Antonio Primo de Rivera]], the son of the former dictator, [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]. Although it only received 0.7 percent of the votes in the election, by July 1936 the Falange had 40,000 members.

In June 1936 [[Miguel de Unamuno]], disenchanted with the unfolding of the events told a reporter who published his statement in El Adelanto that President [[Manuel Azaña]] should commit suicide as a patriotic act”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1= Rabaté  |first1=Jean-Claude|last2= Rabaté  |first2=Colette |authorlink=| date=2009 |title=Miguel de Unamuno: Biografía |publisher=TAURUS  |language=Spanish|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assassinations of political leaders and beginning of the war ==
On 12 July 1936, Lieutenant [[José Castillo (Spanish Civil War)|José Castillo]], an important member of the anti-fascist military organisation [[Unión Militar Republicana Antifascista]] (UMRA), was shot by [[Falange|Falangist]] gunmen.

In response a group of [[Guardia de Asalto]] and other leftist militiamen led by [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]] Fernando Condés, after getting the approval of the minister of interior to illegally arrest a list of members or the parlieament, went to right-wing opposition leader  [[José Calvo Sotelo]]'s house in the early hours of 13 July on a revenge mission. Sotelo was arrested and later shot dead in a police truck. His body was dropped at the entrance of one of the city's cemeteries. According to all later investigations, the perpetrator of the murder was a socialist gunman, Luis Cuenca, who was known as the bodyguard of [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] leader [[Indalecio Prieto]]. Calvo Sotelo was one of the most prominent Spanish monarchists who, describing the government's actions as [[Bolshevism|Bolshevist]] and anarchist, had been exhorting the army to intervene, declaring that Spanish soldiers would save the country from communism if "there are no politicians capable of doing so".&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19360409.2.84&amp;srpos=93729&amp;e=-------10--93721-byDA---0spain-- "Uneasy path". ''Evening Post'', Volume CXXI, Issue 85, 9 April 1936.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102185644/http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=EP19360409.2.84&amp;srpos=93729&amp;e=-------10--93721-byDA---0spain-- |date=2 November 2011 }} [[National Library of New Zealand]]. Retrieved 24 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent rightists blamed the government for Calvo Sotelo's assassination. They claimed that the authorities did not properly investigate it and promoted those involved in the murder whilst censoring those who cried out about it and shutting down the headquarters of right-wing parties and arresting right-wing party members, often on "flimsy charges".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Spanish Civil War|last=G.|first=Payne, Stanley|isbn=9781107002265|location=New York|oclc=782994187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is often considered the catalyst for the further political polarisation that ensued, the Falange and other right-wing individuals, including [[Juan de la Cierva]], had already been conspiring to launch a military coup d'état against the government, to be led by senior army officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley G. Payne|Stanley Payne]] claims the idea of a rebellion by army officers against the government had weakened before these events, but the kidnapping and murder of Calvo Sotelo had an electrifying effect which provided a catalyst to transform what was a "limping conspiracy" to a powerful revolt that could set off a civil war.". The involvement of forces of public order in the plot and a lack of punishment or action against the attackers hurt public opinion of the government. No effective action was taken, Payne points towards possible veto by socialists within the government who shielded the killers who had been drawn from their ranks. Within hours of learning of the murder and the reaction [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] changed his mind on rebellion and dispatched a message to [[Emilio Mola|Mola]] to display his firm commitment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When the antifascist Castillo and the anti-socialist Calvo Sotelo were buried on the same day in the same Madrid cemetery, fighting between the [[Guardia de Asalto|Police Assault Guard]] and fascist militias broke out in the surrounding streets, resulting in four more deaths.

Three days later ([[18 July|17 July]]), the [[coup d'état]] began more or less as it had been planned, with an army uprising in [[Spanish Morocco]], which then spread to several regions of the country. Franco's move was intended to seize power immediately, but his army uprising met with serious resistance, and great swathes of Spain, including most of the main cities, remained loyal to the Republic of Spain. The leaders of the treason (Franco was not commander-in-chief yet) did not lose heart with the stalemate and apparent failure of the coup. Instead, they initiated a slow and determined war of attrition against the Republican government in Madrid.&lt;ref name="iwm.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web

As a result, an estimated total of half a million people would lose their lives in the war that followed; the number of casualties is actually disputed as some have suggested as many as a million people died. Over the years, historians kept lowering the death figures and modern research concluded that 500,000 deaths were the correct figure.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barria-Norton, ''The Spanish Civil War'' (2001), pp. xviii &amp; 899–901, inclusive.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Causes ===
{{Main|Background of the Spanish Civil War}}
The Second Republic was proclaimed during a period of worldwide [[economic depression]]. In spite of the high hopes, the Republican authorities had to struggle with rising unemployment and poverty. In the ensuing civil unrest, violence in the form of assassination, revolutionary [[general strike]]s, and mob actions increased to dangerous levels in the eyes of the traditional centres of power, such as the landowners, the Church, and the nobility. Thus, it was easy for them to whip up dissatisfaction with the republican government.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The murders of the leftist military leader [[José Castillo (Spanish Civil War)|José Castillo]] and the rightist politician [[José Calvo Sotelo]] opened the way to a rapidly increasing flood of violence between the political left and right.

Rightists in Spain justified their military coup against the Republic claiming that it was ungovernable and failed to respond adequately to the threats of communism, anarchism, anti-clericalism, and acts of random violence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helen Graham (historian)|Helen Graham]], among others.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this growth in extreme-left violence, the attitude of the Republican elite was perceived as permissive to the secessionist politics of the wealthy industrial regions of [[Catalonia]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], which were felt by Spanish nationalists to pose a threat to the very existence of Spain as a nation-state.

=== War ===

[[File:Spanish Civil War - Mass grave - Estépar, Burgos.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Twenty-six republicans that were executed by fascists who belonged to [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] Nationalists at the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]], between August and September 1936. This mass grave was placed at the small town named [[Estépar]], in [[Province of Burgos|Burgos]], northern Spain. The excavation occurred in July–August 2014.]]
[[File:Испанская 11 интербригада в бою под Бельчите. 1937-edit.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|[[International Brigades|International Brigadiers]] volunteered on the side of the Republic. The photo shows members of the [[XI International Brigade]] on a [[T-26|T-26 tank]] during the [[Battle of Belchite (1937)|Battle of Belchite]] (August–September 1937).]]
On 17 July 1936, General Franco led the [[Spanish Army of Africa]] from Morocco to attack the mainland, while another force from the north under General [[Emilio Mola]] moved south from Navarre. Military units were also mobilised elsewhere to take over government institutions. Before long the professional Army of Africa had much of the south and west under the control of the rebels. Bloody purges followed in each piece of captured "Nationalist" territory in order to consolidate Franco's future regime.&lt;ref name="iwm.org.uk" /&gt;
Although both sides received foreign military aid, the help that [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]] (as part of [[German involvement in the Spanish Civil War]]), and neighbouring Portugal gave the rebels was much greater and more effective than the assistance that the Republicans received from the USSR, Mexico, and volunteers of the [[International Brigades]]. While the [[Axis powers]] wholeheartedly assisted General Franco's military campaign, the governments of France, Britain, and other European powers looked the other way and let the Republican forces die, as the actions of the [[Non-Intervention Committee]] would show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eroj.org/biblio/ibarruri/adios.htm#mensaje |title=La Pasionaria's Farewell Message to the International Brigade fighters |access-date=30 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726033933/http://www.eroj.org/biblio/ibarruri/adios.htm#mensaje |archive-date=26 July 2011 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Imposed in the name of [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]], the [[international isolation]] of the Spanish Republic ended up favouring the interests of the future [[Axis Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://es.slideshare.net/WALTERWILLIAMMONTALV/la-soledad-de-la-republica-angel-vinas Ángel Viñas, ''La Soledad de la República''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630104607/http://es.slideshare.net/WALTERWILLIAMMONTALV/la-soledad-de-la-republica-angel-vinas |date=30 June 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Siege of the Alcázar]] at Toledo early in the war was a turning point, with the rebels winning after a long siege. The Republicans managed to hold out in Madrid, despite a Nationalist assault in November 1936, and frustrated subsequent offensives against the capital at [[Jarama]] and Guadalajara in 1937. Soon, though, the rebels began to erode their territory, starving Madrid and making inroads into the east. The north, including the Basque country, fell in late 1937, and the Aragon front collapsed shortly afterward. The [[bombing of Guernica]] was probably the most infamous event of the war and inspired [[Guernica (painting)|Picasso's painting]]. It was used as a testing ground for the German Luftwaffe's [[Condor Legion]]. The [[Battle of the Ebro]] in July–November 1938 was the final desperate attempt by the Republicans to turn the tide. When this failed and Barcelona fell to the rebels in early 1939, it was clear the war was over. The remaining Republican fronts collapsed, and Madrid fell in March 1939.
