'''Grace Brewster Murray Hopper''' ({{née|'''Murray'''}} December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American [[computer scientist]] and [[United States Navy]] [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://content.yudu.com/A2qfj4/201403March/resources/3.htm|title = Amazing Grace: Rear Adm. Grace Hopper, USN, was a pioneer in computer science|first = Mark|last = Cantrell|magazine = Military Officer|publisher = Military Officers Association of America|volume = 12|issue = 3|pages = 52–55, 106|date = March 1, 2014|accessdate = March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first programmers of the [[Harvard Mark I|Harvard Mark&amp;nbsp;I]] computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first [[Linker (computing)|linkers]]. She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of [[COBOL]], an early [[high-level programming language]] still in use today.

Prior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from [[Yale University]] and was a professor of mathematics at [[Vassar College]]. Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during [[World War II]] but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by [[Howard H. Aiken]]. In 1949, she joined the [[Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation]] and was part of the team that developed the [[UNIVAC I]] computer.  At Eckert–Mauchly she began developing the compiler. She believed that a programming language based on English was possible.  Her compiler converted English terms into [[machine code]] understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program [[Linker (computing)|linker]] (originally called a compiler), which was written for the [[A-0 System]].&lt;ref name="Spencer85"&gt;{{cite book|title=Computers and Information Processing|publisher=C.E.

In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like [[FLOW-MATIC]]. In 1959, she participated in the [[CODASYL]] consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the [[COBOL]] language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967 the Navy recalled her to active duty.  She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], sharing her computing experiences.

The U.S. Navy {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|0}} guided-missile destroyer {{USS|Hopper}} was named for her, as was the [[Cray XE6]] "Hopper" supercomputer at [[NERSC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-systems/retired-systems/hopper/|title=Hopper|website=www.nersc.gov|access-date=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. A [[Hopper College|college]] at [[Yale University]] was renamed in her honor.  In 1991, she received the [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation|National Medal of Technology]]. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-medal-of-freedom-margaret-hamilton-grace-hopper/|title=White House honors two of tech's female pioneers|work=cbsnews.com|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
{{Listen|type=speech|pos=right|filename=Grace Hopper (As Told By U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith).oggvorbis.ogg|title=Grace Hopper (As Told By U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith)|description= }}
Hopper was born in New York City. She was the eldest of three children. Her parents, Walter Fletcher Murray and Mary Campbell Van Horne, were of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent, and attended [[West End Collegiate Church]].&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KKmiw-_2gYIC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=%22Grace+Hooper%22+and+military+ranks|title=Grace Hopper: Admiral of the Cyber Sea|last=Williams|first=Kathleen|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-61251-265-5|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her great-grandfather, Alexander Wilson Russell, an admiral in the US Navy, fought in the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

Grace was very curious as a child; this was a lifelong trait. At the age of seven, she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Journal |last1=Dickason |first=Elizabeth |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bl_Grace_Murray_Hopper.htm |title=Looking Back: Grace Murray Hopper's Younger Years |journal=Chips |date=April 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] education, she attended the [[Wardlaw-Hartridge School|Hartridge School]] in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]]. Hopper was initially rejected for early admission to [[Vassar College]] at age 16 (her test scores in Latin were too low), but she was admitted the following year. She graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] from Vassar in 1928 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and physics and earned her master's degree at [[Yale University]] in 1930.

In 1934, she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale&lt;ref name="NWHM"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/grace-hopper| title=Grace Hopper | accessdate=July 11, 2018| publisher=National Women's History Museum| website=womenshistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of [[Øystein Ore]].&lt;ref name="greenladuke09"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Though some books, including Kurt Beyer's ''Grace Hopper and the Invention of the Information Age'', reported that Hopper was the first woman to earn a Yale PhD in mathematics, the first of ten women prior to 1934 was Charlotte Cynthia Barnum (1860–1934). {{Cite news | last = Murray | first = Margaret A.

==Career==

===World War II===
[[File:Harvard Mark I sign-up.agr.jpg|thumb|Hopper's signatures on a duty officer signup sheet for the Bureau of Ships Computation Project at Harvard, which built and operated the [[Harvard Mark I|Mark I]]]]
Hopper had tried to enlist in the Navy early in [[World War II]]. She was rejected for a few reasons. At age 34, she was too old to enlist, and her weight to height ratio was too low. She was also denied on the basis that her job as a mathematician and mathematics professor at Vassar College was valuable to the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thocp.net/biographies/hopper_grace.html|title=Grace Hopper|website=www.thocp.net|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war in 1943, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the [[United States Navy Reserve]]; she was one of many women who volunteered to serve in the [[WAVES]]. She had to get an exemption to enlist; she was {{convert|15|lb}} below the Navy minimum weight of {{convert|120|lb}}. She reported in December and trained at the Naval Reserve Midshipmen's School at [[Smith College]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]]. Hopper graduated first in her class in 1944, and was assigned to the [[Bureau of Ships]] Computation Project at [[Harvard University]] as a lieutenant, junior grade. She served on the [[Harvard Mark I|Mark I computer]] programming staff headed by [[Howard H. Aiken]]. Hopper and Aiken co-authored three papers on the Mark I, also known as the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator. Hopper's request to transfer to the regular Navy at the end of the war was declined due to her advanced age of 38. She continued to serve in the Navy Reserve. Hopper remained at the Harvard Computation Lab until 1949, turning down a full professorship at Vassar in favor of working as a research fellow under a Navy contract at Harvard.&lt;ref name="KBW"&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Kathleen Broome |title=Improbable Warriors: Women Scientists and the U.S. Navy in World War II |accessdate= |edition= |year=2001 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Maryland |isbn=978-1-55750-961-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNIVAC===
In 1949, Hopper became an employee of the [[Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation]] as a senior mathematician and joined the team developing the [[UNIVAC I]].&lt;ref name=Ogilvie /&gt;  Hopper also served as UNIVAC director of Automatic Programming Development for Remington Rand. The UNIVAC was the first known large-scale electronic computer to be on the market in 1950, and was more competitive at processing information than the Mark I.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American women inventors|last=Ann.|first=Camp, Carole|date=2004|publisher=Enslow Publishers|isbn=978-0-7660-1538-8|location=Berkeley Heights, NJ|oclc=48398924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hopper recommended the development of a new programming language that would use entirely English words, she "was told very quickly that [she] couldn't do this because computers didn't understand English." Still, she persisted. “It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols,” she explained. “So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in History|url= https://stories.vassar.edu/2017/assets/images/170706-legacy-of-grace-hopper-hopperpdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her idea was not accepted for 3 years. In the meantime, she published her first paper on the subject, compilers, in 1952. In the early 1950s, the company was taken over by the [[Remington Rand]] corporation, and it was while she was working for them that her original [[compiler]] work was done.  The program was known as the A compiler and its first version was [[A-0 programming language|A-0]].&lt;ref name="mcgee2004" /&gt;{{rp|11}}

In 1952, she had an operational link-loader, which at the time was referred to as a compiler. She later said that "Nobody believed that," and that she "had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tap/Files/hopper-wit.html|title=The Wit and Wisdom of Grace Hopper}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to say that her compiler "translated mathematical notation into machine code. Manipulating symbols was fine for mathematicians but it was no good for data processors who were not symbol manipulators. Very few people are really symbol manipulators. If they are they become professional mathematicians, not data processors. It's much easier for most people to write an English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and the computers would translate them into machine code. That was the beginning of [[COBOL]], a [[computer language]] for data processors. I could say "Subtract income tax from pay" instead of trying to write that in octal code or using all kinds of symbols. [[COBOL]] is the major language used today in data processing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/grace-murray-hopper/id1197529986?mt=11|title=Women of Wisdom: Grace Murray Hopper|first=Lynn|last=Gilbert|date=1981|publisher=Lynn Gilbert, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 Hopper was named the company's first director of automatic programming, and her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including [[MATH-MATIC]] and [[FLOW-MATIC]].&lt;ref name=Ogilvie /&gt;

===COBOL===
[[File: Grace Hopper and UNIVAC.jpg|thumb|Hopper at the [[UNIVAC I]] console, c. 1960]]
In the spring of 1959, computer experts from industry and government were brought together in a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages ([[CODASYL]]). Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language [[COBOL]] (an acronym for '''CO'''mmon '''B'''usiness-'''O'''riented '''L'''anguage). The new language extended Hopper's FLOW-MATIC language with some ideas from the [[IBM]] equivalent, [[COMTRAN]].  Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a language that was close to English (rather than in [[machine code]] or in languages close to machine code, such as [[assembly language]]s) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date.&lt;ref name="KWB"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beyer |first=Kurt W. |title=Grace Hopper and the Invention of the Information Age |accessdate= |edition= |year=2009 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-262-01310-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the members of the committee that worked on COBOL was [[Mount Holyoke College]] alumnus [[Jean E. Sammet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/technology/obituary-jean-sammet-software-designer-cobol.html|title=Jean Sammet, Co-Designer of a Pioneering Computer Language, Dies at 89|first=Steve|last=Lohr|date=June 4, 2017|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning and was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (United States O-6)|captain]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="KBW"/&gt; She developed validation software for COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire Navy.&lt;ref name="KBW" /&gt;

===Standards===
In the 1970s, Hopper advocated for the Defense Department to replace large, centralized systems with networks of small, distributed computers. Any user on any computer node could access common databases located on the network.&lt;ref name="mcgee2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=McGee |first=Russell C.|title=My Adventure with Dwarfs: A Personal History in Mainframe Computers |url=http://www.cbi.umn.edu/hostedpublications/pdf/McGee_Book-4.2.2.pdf |publisher=Charles Babbage Institute |location=University of Minnesota |date=2004 |accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}} She developed the implementation of [[standardization|standards]] for testing computer systems and components, most significantly for early [[programming language]]s such as [[FORTRAN]] and COBOL. The Navy tests for conformance to these standards led to significant convergence among the programming language dialects of the major computer vendors. In the 1980s, these tests (and their official administration) were assumed by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS), known today as the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST).

==Retirement==
[[File:Grace Hopper being promoted to Commodore.JPEG|thumb|left|Hopper being promoted to the rank of commodore in 1983]]
In accordance with Navy attrition regulations, Hopper retired from the Naval Reserve with the rank of [[Commander (United States)|commander]] at age 60 at the end of 1966.&lt;ref name="urlAttrition/Retirement"&gt;{{cite web |title=Attrition/Retirement |url=http://www.public.navy.mil/BUPERS-NPC/CAREER/RESERVEPERSONNELMGMT/OFFICERS/Pages/AttritionRetirement.aspx |accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was recalled to active duty in August 1967 for a six-month period that turned into an indefinite assignment.  She again retired in 1971 but was again asked to return to active duty in 1972. She was promoted to [[Captain (United States O-6)|captain]] in 1973 by [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Elmo R.

Following a career that spanned more than 42 years, Admiral Hopper took retirement from the Navy on August 14, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/08/14/Navy-Admiral-Grace-Hopper-retires/2916524376000/ |title=Navy Admiral Grace Hopper retires |last=Taffe Jr. |first=Richard |date=1986-08-14 |work=[[United Press International]] |access-date=2018-12-07 |language=en |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a celebration held in Boston on the {{USS|Constitution}} to commemorate her retirement, Hopper was awarded the [[Defense Distinguished Service Medal]], the highest non-combat decoration awarded by the Department of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tap/Files/hopper-medal.html |title=Admiral Hopper Awarded the National Medal of Technology |publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] |date=1991-09-16 |access-date=2018-12-07 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of her retirement, she was the oldest active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Navy (79 years, eight months and five days), and had her retirement ceremony aboard the oldest commissioned ship in the United States Navy (188 years, nine months and 23 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=[[Detroit Free Press]] |date=August 15, 1986 |page=4A |url=http://www.waterholes.com/~dennette/1996/hopper/860815.htm |title=Computer Whiz Retires from Navy |agency=United Press International |access-date=June 3, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222204821/http://www.waterholes.com/~dennette/1996/hopper/860815.htm |archive-date=February 22, 2014 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Admirals [[William D. Leahy]], [[Chester W. Nimitz]], [[Hyman G. Rickover]] and [[Charles Stewart (1778–1869)|Charles Stewart]] were the only other officers in the Navy's history to serve on active duty at a higher age.  Leahy and Nimitz served on active duty for life due to their promotions to the rank of [[Fleet admiral (United States)|fleet admiral]].)

==Post-retirement==
Following her retirement from the Navy, she was hired as a senior consultant to [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC). Hopper was initially offered a position by Rita Yavinsky, but she insisted on going through the typical formal interview process. She then proposed in jest that she would be willing to accept a position which made her available on alternating Thursdays, exhibited at their museum of computing as a pioneer, in exchange for a generous salary and unlimited expense account. Instead, she was hired as a full-time senior consultant. In this position, Hopper represented the company at industry forums, serving on various industry committees, along with other obligations.&lt;ref name="williams"/&gt; She retained that position until her death at age 85 in 1992.

At DEC Hopper served primarily as a goodwill ambassador. She lectured widely about the early days of computing, her career, and on efforts that computer vendors could take to make life easier for their users. She visited most of Digital's engineering facilities, where she generally received a standing ovation at the conclusion of her remarks. Although no longer a serving officer, she always wore her Navy full dress uniform to these lectures in defiance of U.S. Department of Defense policy.&lt;ref name="32CFR53.2"&gt;{{cite web |title=32 CFR § 53.2 - Policy. |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/32/53.2 |website=Legal Information Institute |publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=26 November 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler," she said, "is training young people." They come to me, you know, and say, 'Do you think we can do this?' I say, 'Try it.' And I back 'em up. They need that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don't forget to take chances."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Lynn |title=Particular Passions: Grace Murray Hopper |series=Women of Wisdom Series |edition=1st |date=December 10, 2012 |publisher=Lynn Gilbert Inc. |location=New York City |isbn=978-1-61979-403-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Throughout much of her later career, Hopper was much in demand as a speaker at various computer-related events. She was well known for her lively and irreverent speaking style, as well as a rich treasury of early war stories. She also received the nickname "Grandma COBOL".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/comic-riffs/post/grace-hopper-doodle-by-writing-computer-language-pioneering-grandma-cobol-helped-rewrite-the-history-books/2013/12/09/72a80e36-60bf-11e3-8beb-3f9a9942850f_blog.html |title=Grace Hopper: Google Doodle honors computing pioneer |last=Cavna |first=Michael |date=2013-12-09 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=2018-12-07 |language=en |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Grace Hopper is famous for her ''nanoseconds'' visual aid. People (such as generals and admirals) used to ask her why [[satellite]] communication took so long.  She started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long ({{Convert|11.8|in|cm}})—the distance that light travels in one [[nanosecond]]. She gave these pieces of wire the [[Metonymy|metonym]] "nanoseconds."&lt;ref name="DavidLetterman86"&gt;{{Cite episode | title = Late Night with David Letterman | series = Late Night with David Letterman| serieslink = Late Night with David Letterman| network = [[NBC]]| location = New York City| airdate = October 2, 1986| season = 5| number = 771|quote="[to President Ronald Reagan on her promotion] Sir ...

YouTube title: Grace Hopper on Letterman}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was careful to tell her audience that the length of her nanoseconds was actually the maximum speed the signals would travel in a vacuum, and that signals would travel more slowly through the actual wires that were her teaching aids. Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast. At many of her talks and visits, she handed out "nanoseconds" to everyone in the audience, contrasting them with a coil of wire {{convert|984|feet|meters|abbr=off}} long,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsKnWZrJ8|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing a [[microsecond]].
