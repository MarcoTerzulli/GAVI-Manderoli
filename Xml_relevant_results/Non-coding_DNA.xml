      <text bytes="53008" xml:space="preserve">'''Non-coding DNA''' sequences are components of an organism's [[DNA]] that do not [[genetic code|encode]] [[protein]] sequences. Some non-coding DNA is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] into functional [[non-coding RNA]] molecules (e.g. [[transfer RNA]], [[ribosomal RNA]], and [[RNA interference|regulatory RNAs]]). Other functions of non-coding DNA include the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]al and [[translation (biology)|translational]] [[regulatory sequence|regulation]] of protein-coding sequences,  [[scaffold attachment region]]s, [[origin of replication|origins of DNA replication]], [[centromere]]s and [[telomere]]s.

The amount of non-coding DNA varies greatly among species. Often, only a small percentage of the genome is responsible for coding proteins, but an increasing percentage is being shown to have regulatory functions. When there is much non-coding DNA, a large proportion appears to have no biological function, as predicted in the 1960s. Since that time, this non-functional portion has controversially been called "junk DNA".&lt;ref name=pennisi&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pennisi E | title = Genomics.

== Fraction of non-coding genomic DNA ==
[[File:Utricularia gibba flower 01.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Utricularia gibba]]'' has only 3% non-coding DNA.&lt;ref name="DesignNTrend"&gt;{{cite news|title=Worlds Record Breaking Plant: Deletes its Noncoding "Junk" DNA|date=May 12, 2013|work=Design &amp; Trend|url=http://www.designntrend.com/articles/4291/20130512/worlds-record-breaking-plant-deletes-noncoding-junk-dna.htm|access-date=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The amount of total genomic DNA varies widely between organisms, and the proportion of coding and non-coding DNA within these genomes varies greatly as well.  For example, it was originally suggested that over 98% of the [[human genome]] does not encode protein sequences, including most sequences within [[intron]]s and most [[intergenic region|intergenic DNA]],&lt;ref name="Elgar &amp; Vavouri"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elgar G, Vavouri T | title = Tuning in to the signals: noncoding sequence conservation in vertebrate genomes | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 24 | issue = 7 | pages = 344–52 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18514361 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2008.04.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while 20% of a typical [[prokaryote]] genome is non-coding.&lt;ref name="Costa non-coding"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Costa|first1=Fabrico|editor1-last=Morris|editor1-first=Kevin V.|title=Non-coding RNAs and Epigenetic Regulation of Gene Expression: Drivers of Natural Selection|date=2012|publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]]|isbn=978-1904455943|chapter=7 Non-coding RNAs, Epigenomics, and Complexity in Human Cells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In eukaryotes, [[genome size]], and by extension the amount of non-coding DNA, is not correlated to organism complexity, an observation known as the [[C-value enigma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=C.A. |title=The genetic organization of chromosomes |journal=Annu. Rev. Genet. |date=1971 |volume=5 |pages=237–256|doi=10.1146/annurev.ge.05.120171.001321 |pmid=16097657 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the genome of the unicellular ''[[Polychaos dubium]]'' (formerly known as ''Amoeba dubia'') has been reported to contain more than 200 times the amount of DNA in humans.&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gregory TR, Hebert PD | title = The modulation of DNA content: proximate causes and ultimate consequences | journal = Genome Research | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 317–24 | date = April 1999 | pmid = 10207154 | doi = 10.1101/gr.9.4.317 | doi-broken-date = 2020-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pufferfish]] ''[[Takifugu]] rubripes'' genome is only about one eighth the size of the human genome, yet seems to have a comparable number of genes; approximately 90% of the ''Takifugu'' genome is non-coding DNA.&lt;ref name="Elgar &amp; Vavouri"/&gt; Therefore, most of the difference in genome size is not due to variation in amount of coding DNA, rather, it is due to a difference in the amount of non-coding DNA.&lt;ref name="Ohno"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=So Much "junk" DNA in Our Genome|url=http://www.junkdna.com/ohno.html | vauthors = Ohno S|journal=Brookhaven Symposia in Biology |year=1972|volume=23 | veditors = Smith HH |pages=366–370|publisher=Gordon and Breach, New York |pmid=5065367 |access-date= 2013-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a new "record" for the most efficient eukaryotic genome was discovered with ''[[Utricularia gibba]]'', a [[bladderwort]] plant that has only 3% non-coding DNA and 97% of coding DNA. Parts of the non-coding DNA were being deleted by the plant and this suggested that non-coding DNA may not be as critical for plants, even though non-coding DNA is useful for humans.&lt;ref name="DesignNTrend" /&gt; Other studies on plants have discovered crucial functions in portions of non-coding DNA that were previously thought to be negligible and have added a new layer to the understanding of gene regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waterhouse PM, Hellens RP | title = Plant biology: Coding in non-coding RNAs | journal = Nature | volume = 520 | issue = 7545 | pages = 41–2 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25807488 | doi = 10.1038/nature14378 | bibcode = 2015Natur.520...41W | url = https://rdcu.be/bwUdE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of non-coding DNA sequences==
{{main|Conserved non-coding sequence}}

===Cis- and trans-regulatory elements===
[[Cis-regulatory element]]s are sequences that control the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of a nearby gene. Many such elements are involved in the [[evolutionary developmental biology|evolution and control of development]].&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carroll SB | title = Evo-devo and an expanding evolutionary synthesis: a genetic theory of morphological evolution | journal = Cell | volume = 134 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–36 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18614008 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.06.030 | authorlink1 = Sean B. Carroll }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cis-elements may be located in [[Directionality (molecular biology)#5′-end|5']] or [[Directionality (molecular biology)#3′-end|3']] [[untranslated region]]s or within [[intron]]s. [[Trans-regulatory element]]s control the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of a distant gene.

[[promoter (biology)|Promoter]]s facilitate the transcription of a particular gene and are typically [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|upstream]] of the coding region. [[Enhancer (genetics)|Enhancer]] sequences may also exert very distant effects on the transcription levels of genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Visel A, Rubin EM, Pennacchio LA | title = Genomic views of distant-acting enhancers | journal = Nature | volume = 461 | issue = 7261 | pages = 199–205 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19741700 | pmc = 2923221 | doi = 10.1038/nature08451 | bibcode = 2009Natur.461..199V | authorlink3 = Len A. Pennacchio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introns===
[[File:Pre-mRNA.svg|right|thumbnail|420px|Illustration of an unspliced pre-mRNA precursor, with five [[intron]]s and six [[exon]]s (top). After the introns have been removed via splicing, the mature mRNA sequence is ready for translation (bottom).]]

[[Intron]]s are non-coding sections of a gene, transcribed into the [[precursor mRNA]] sequence, but ultimately removed by [[RNA splicing]] during the processing to mature [[messenger RNA]]. Many introns appear to be [[mobile genetic elements]].&lt;ref name=intron/&gt;

Studies of [[group I intron]]s from ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' [[protozoans]] indicate that some introns appear to be selfish genetic elements, neutral to the host because they remove themselves from flanking [[exon]]s during [[RNA processing]] and do not produce an expression bias between [[allele]]s with and without the intron.&lt;ref name=intron&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nielsen H, Johansen SD | title = Group I introns: Moving in new directions | journal = RNA Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 375–83 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19667762 | doi = 10.4161/rna.6.4.9334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some introns appear to have significant biological function, possibly through [[ribozyme]] functionality that may regulate [[tRNA]] and [[rRNA]] activity as well as protein-coding gene expression, evident in hosts that have become dependent on such introns over long periods of time; for example, the ''trnL-intron'' is found in all [[green plant]]s and appears to have been [[Vertical gene transfer|vertically inherited]] for several billions of years, including more than a billion years within [[chloroplast]]s and an additional 2–3 billion years prior in the [[cyanobacteria]]l ancestors of chloroplasts.&lt;ref name=intron/&gt;

===Pseudogenes===
[[Pseudogene]]s are DNA sequences, related to known [[gene]]s, that have lost their protein-coding ability or are otherwise no longer [[Gene expression|expressed]] in the cell. Pseudogenes arise from retrotransposition or genomic duplication of functional genes, and become "genomic fossils" that are nonfunctional due to [[mutation]]s that prevent the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of the gene, such as within the gene promoter region, or fatally alter the [[translation (biology)|translation]] of the gene, such as premature [[stop codon]]s or [[Translational frameshift|frameshift]]s.&lt;ref name=pmid17568002&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zheng D, Frankish A, Baertsch R, Kapranov P, Reymond A, Choo SW, Lu Y, Denoeud F, Antonarakis SE, Snyder M, Ruan Y, Wei CL, Gingeras TR, Guigó R, Harrow J, Gerstein MB | title = Pseudogenes in the ENCODE regions: consensus annotation, analysis of transcription, and evolution | journal = Genome Research | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 839–51 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17568002 | pmc = 1891343 | doi = 10.1101/gr.5586307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pseudogenes resulting from the retrotransposition of an RNA intermediate are known as processed pseudogenes; pseudogenes that arise from the genomic remains of [[gene duplication|duplicated genes]] or residues of inactivated genes are nonprocessed pseudogenes.&lt;ref name=pmid17568002/&gt; Transpositions of once functional mitochondrial genes from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, also known as [[NUMT]]s, also qualify as one type of common pseudogene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lopez JV, Yuhki N, Masuda R, Modi W, O'Brien SJ | year = 1994 | title = ''Numt'', a recent transfer and tandem amplification of mitochondrial DNA to the nuclear genome of the domestic cat | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 39 | issue = 2| pages = 174–190 | doi = 10.1007/bf00163806 | doi-broken-date = 2020-04-29 | pmid = 7932781 | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00163806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numts occur in many eukaryotic taxa.

While [[Dollo's Law]] suggests that the loss of function in pseudogenes is likely permanent, silenced genes may actually retain function for several million years and can be "reactivated" into protein-coding sequences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marshall CR, Raff EC, Raff RA | title = Dollo's law and the death and resurrection of genes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 91 | issue = 25 | pages = 12283–7 | date = December 1994 | pmid = 7991619 | pmc = 45421 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.25.12283 | bibcode = 1994PNAS...9112283M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a substantial number of pseudogenes are actively transcribed.&lt;ref name=pmid17568002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tutar Y | title = Pseudogenes | journal = Comparative and Functional Genomics | volume = 2012 | issue =  | pages = 1–4 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22611337 | pmc = 3352212 | doi = 10.1155/2012/424526 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because pseudogenes are presumed to change without evolutionary constraint, they can serve as a useful model of the type and frequencies of various spontaneous [[genetic mutation]]s.&lt;ref name="Petrov &amp; Hartl"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petrov DA, Hartl DL | title = Pseudogene evolution and natural selection for a compact genome | journal = The Journal of Heredity | volume = 91 | issue = 3 | pages = 221–7 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10833048 | doi = 10.1093/jhered/91.3.221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repeat sequences, transposons and viral elements===

[[File:Bacterial mobile elements.svg|thumb|300px|[[Mobile genetic elements]] in the cell (left) and how they can be acquired (right)]]

[[Transposon]]s and [[retrotransposon]]s are [[mobile genetic elements]]. Retrotransposon [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repeated sequences]], which include [[Retrotransposon#LINEs|long interspersed nuclear elements]] (LINEs) and [[Retrotransposon#SINEs|short interspersed nuclear elements]] (SINEs), account for a large proportion of the genomic sequences in many species. [[Alu sequence]]s, classified as a short interspersed nuclear element, are the most abundant mobile elements in the human genome. Some examples have been found of SINEs exerting transcriptional control of some protein-encoding genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ponicsan SL, Kugel JF, Goodrich JA | title = Genomic gems: SINE RNAs regulate mRNA production | journal = Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–55 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20176473 | pmc = 2859989 | doi = 10.1016/j.gde.2010.01.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Häsler J, Samuelsson T, Strub K | title = Useful 'junk': Alu RNAs in the human transcriptome | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 64 | issue = 14 | pages = 1793–800 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17514354 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-007-7084-0 | url = http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:17489 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walters RD, Kugel JF, Goodrich JA | title = InvAluable junk: the cellular impact and function of Alu and B2 RNAs | journal = IUBMB Life | volume = 61 | issue = 8 | pages = 831–7 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19621349 | pmc = 4049031 | doi = 10.1002/iub.227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Endogenous retrovirus]] sequences are the product of [[reverse transcription]] of [[retrovirus]] genomes into the genomes of [[germ cell]]s.

Over 8% of the human genome is made up of (mostly decayed) endogenous retrovirus sequences, as part of the over 42% fraction that is recognizably derived of retrotransposons, while another 3% can be identified to be the remains of [[Transposon#Class II: DNA transposons|DNA transposon]]s. Much of the remaining half of the genome that is currently without an explained origin is expected to have found its origin in transposable elements that were active so long ago (&gt; 200 million years) that random mutations have rendered them unrecognizable.&lt;ref name=humangenome&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lander ES, Linton LM, Birren B, Nusbaum C, Zody MC, Baldwin J, Devon K, Dewar K, Doyle M, FitzHugh W, Funke R, Gage D, Harris K, Heaford A, Howland J, Kann L, Lehoczky J, LeVine R, McEwan P, McKernan K, Meldrim J, Mesirov JP, Miranda C, Morris W, Naylor J, Raymond C, Rosetti M, Santos R, Sheridan A, Sougnez C, Stange-Thomann Y, Stojanovic N, Subramanian A, Wyman D, Rogers J, Sulston J, Ainscough R, Beck S, Bentley D, Burton J, Clee C, Carter N, Coulson A, Deadman R, Deloukas P, Dunham A, Dunham I, Durbin R, French L, Grafham D, Gregory S, Hubbard T, Humphray S, Hunt A, Jones M, Lloyd C, McMurray A, Matthews L, Mercer S, Milne S, Mullikin JC, Mungall A, Plumb R, Ross M, Shownkeen R, Sims S, Waterston RH, Wilson RK, Hillier LW, McPherson JD, Marra MA, Mardis ER, Fulton LA, Chinwalla AT, Pepin KH, Gish WR, Chissoe SL, Wendl MC, Delehaunty KD, Miner TL, Delehaunty A, Kramer JB, Cook LL, Fulton RS, Johnson DL, Minx PJ, Clifton SW, Hawkins T, Branscomb E, Predki P, Richardson P, Wenning S, Slezak T, Doggett N, Cheng JF, Olsen A, Lucas S, Elkin C, Uberbacher E, Frazier M, Gibbs RA, Muzny DM, Scherer SE, Bouck JB, Sodergren EJ, Worley KC, Rives CM, Gorrell JH, Metzker ML, Naylor SL, Kucherlapati RS, Nelson DL, Weinstock GM, Sakaki Y, Fujiyama A, Hattori M, Yada T, Toyoda A, Itoh T, Kawagoe C, Watanabe H, Totoki Y, Taylor T, Weissenbach J, Heilig R, Saurin W, Artiguenave F, Brottier P, Bruls T, Pelletier E, Robert C, Wincker P, Smith DR, Doucette-Stamm L, Rubenfield M, Weinstock K, Lee HM, Dubois J, Rosenthal A, Platzer M, Nyakatura G, Taudien S, Rump A, Yang H, Yu J, Wang J, Huang G, Gu J, Hood L, Rowen L, Madan A, Qin S, Davis RW, Federspiel NA, Abola AP, Proctor MJ, Myers RM, Schmutz J, Dickson M, Grimwood J, Cox DR, Olson MV, Kaul R, Raymond C, Shimizu N, Kawasaki K, Minoshima S, Evans GA, Athanasiou M, Schultz R, Roe BA, Chen F, Pan H, Ramser J, Lehrach H, Reinhardt R, McCombie WR, de la Bastide M, Dedhia N, Blöcker H, Hornischer K, Nordsiek G, Agarwala R, Aravind L, Bailey JA, Bateman A, Batzoglou S, Birney E, Bork P, Brown DG, Burge CB, Cerutti L, Chen HC, Church D, Clamp M, Copley RR, Doerks T, Eddy SR, Eichler EE, Furey TS, Galagan J, Gilbert JG, Harmon C, Hayashizaki Y, Haussler D, Hermjakob H, Hokamp K, Jang W, Johnson LS, Jones TA, Kasif S, Kaspryzk A, Kennedy S, Kent WJ, Kitts P, Koonin EV, Korf I, Kulp D, Lancet D, Lowe TM, McLysaght A, Mikkelsen T, Moran JV, Mulder N, Pollara VJ, Ponting CP, Schuler G, Schultz J, Slater G, Smit AF, Stupka E, Szustakowki J, Thierry-Mieg D, Thierry-Mieg J, Wagner L, Wallis J, Wheeler R, Williams A, Wolf YI, Wolfe KH, Yang SP, Yeh RF, Collins F, Guyer MS, Peterson J, Felsenfeld A, Wetterstrand KA, Patrinos A, Morgan MJ, de Jong P, Catanese JJ, Osoegawa K, Shizuya H, Choi S, Chen YJ, Szustakowki J | display-authors = 6 | title = Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6822 | pages = 860–921 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11237011 | doi = 10.1038/35057062 | bibcode = 2001Natur.409..860L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genome size variation in at least two kinds of plants is mostly the result of retrotransposon sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Piegu B, Guyot R, Picault N, Roulin A, Sanyal A, Saniyal A, Kim H, Collura K, Brar DS, Jackson S, Wing RA, Panaud O | title = Doubling genome size without polyploidization: dynamics of retrotransposition-driven genomic expansions in Oryza australiensis, a wild relative of rice | journal = Genome Research | volume = 16 | issue = 10 | pages = 1262–9 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16963705 | pmc = 1581435 | doi = 10.1101/gr.5290206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hawkins JS, Kim H, Nason JD, Wing RA, Wendel JF | title = Differential lineage-specific amplification of transposable elements is responsible for genome size variation in Gossypium | journal = Genome Research | volume = 16 | issue = 10 | pages = 1252–61 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16954538 | pmc = 1581434 | doi = 10.1101/gr.5282906 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Telomeres===
[[Telomere]]s are regions of repetitive DNA at the end of a [[chromosome]], which provide protection from chromosomal deterioration during [[DNA replication]]. Recent studies have shown that telomeres function to aid in its own stability. Telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) are transcripts derived from telomeres. TERRA has been shown to maintain telomerase activity and lengthen the ends of chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cusanelli E, Chartrand P | title = Telomeric noncoding RNA: telomeric repeat-containing RNA in telomere biology | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: RNA | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 407–19 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24523222 | doi = 10.1002/wrna.1220 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Junk DNA==
The term "junk DNA" became popular in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="EhretdeHaller1963"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ehret CF, De Haller G | journal = Journal of Ultrastructure Research | volume = 23 | pages = SUPPL6:1–42 | date = October 1963 | pmid = 14073743 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5320(63)80088-X | title = Origin, development, and maturation of organelles and organelle systems of the cell surface in Paramecium }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Graur, [http://judgestarling.tumblr.com/post/64504735261/the-origin-of-junk-dna-a-historical-whodunnit The Origin of Junk DNA: A Historical Whodunnit ]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[T. Ryan Gregory]], the nature of junk DNA was first discussed explicitly in 1972 by a genomic biologist, David Comings, who applied the term to all non-coding DNA.&lt;ref name="Gregory Evolution Genome"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Gregory|editor1-first=T. Ryan|title=The Evolution of the Genome|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0123014634|pages=29–31|quote= Comings (1972), on the other hand, gave what must be considered the first explicit discussion of the nature of "junk DNA," and was the first to apply the term to all non-coding DNA."; "For this reason, it is unlikely that any one function for non-coding DNA can account for either its sheer mass or its unequal distribution among taxa. However, dismissing it as no more than "junk" in the pejorative sense of "useless" or "wasteful" does little to advance the understanding of genome evolution. For this reason, the far less loaded term "noncoding DNA" is used throughout this chapter and is recommended in preference to "junk DNA" for future treatments of the subject."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was formalized that same year by [[Susumu Ohno]],&lt;ref name="Ohno"/&gt; who noted that the [[mutational load]] from deleterious mutations placed an upper limit on the number of functional loci that could be expected given a typical mutation rate. Ohno hypothesized that mammal genomes could not have more than 30,000 loci under selection before the "cost" from the mutational load would cause an inescapable decline in fitness, and eventually extinction. This prediction remains robust, with the human genome containing approximately (protein-coding) 20,000 genes. Another source for Ohno's theory was the observation that even closely related species can have widely (orders-of-magnitude) different genome sizes, which had been dubbed the [[C-value|C-value paradox]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=eddy/&gt;

The term "junk DNA" has been questioned on the grounds that it provokes a strong ''a priori'' assumption of total non-functionality and some have recommended using more neutral terminology such as "non-coding DNA" instead.&lt;ref name="Gregory Evolution Genome" /&gt; Yet "junk DNA" remains a label for the portions of a [[genome]] sequence for which no discernible [[Function (biology)|function]] has been identified and that through [[comparative genomics]] analysis appear under no [[conserved sequence|functional constraint]] suggesting that the sequence itself has provided no [[adaptation|adaptive advantage]].

Since the late 70s it has become apparent that the majority of non-coding DNA in large genomes finds its origin in the [[selfish DNA|selfish]] amplification of [[transposable element]]s, of which [[Ford Doolittle|W. Ford Doolittle]] and Carmen Sapienza in 1980 wrote in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'': "When a given DNA, or class of DNAs, of unproven phenotypic function can be shown to have evolved a strategy (such as transposition) which ensures its genomic survival, then no other explanation for its existence is necessary."&lt;ref name="Doolittle1980"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doolittle WF, Sapienza C | title = Selfish genes, the phenotype paradigm and genome evolution | journal = Nature | volume = 284 | issue = 5757 | pages = 601–3 | date = April 1980 | pmid = 6245369 | doi = 10.1038/284601a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.284..601D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of junk DNA can be expected to depend on the rate of amplification of these elements and the rate at which non-functional DNA is lost.&lt;ref&gt;Another source is [[Paleopolyploidy|genome duplication]] followed by a loss of function due to redundancy.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same issue of ''Nature'', [[Leslie Orgel]] and [[Francis Crick]] wrote that junk DNA has "little specificity and conveys little or no selective advantage to the organism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Orgel LE, Crick FH | title = Selfish DNA: the ultimate parasite | journal = Nature | volume = 284 | issue = 5757 | pages = 604–7 | date = April 1980 | pmid = 7366731 | doi = 10.1038/284604a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.284..604O }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term occurs mainly in [[popular science]] and in a [[colloquialism|colloquial]] way in scientific publications, and it has been suggested that its connotations may have delayed interest in the biological functions of non-coding DNA.&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khajavinia A, Makalowski W | title = What is "junk" DNA, and what is it worth? | journal = Scientific American | volume = 296 | issue = 5 | pages = 104 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17503549 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0307-104 | quote = The term "junk DNA" repelled mainstream researchers from studying noncoding genetic material for many years | bibcode = 2007SciAm.296c.104. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence indicate that some "junk DNA" sequences are sources for (future) functional activity in evolution through [[exaptation]] of originally selfish or non-functional DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Biémont C, Vieira C | title = Genetics: junk DNA as an evolutionary force | journal = Nature | volume = 443 | issue = 7111 | pages = 521–4 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17024082 | doi = 10.1038/443521a | bibcode = 2006Natur.443..521B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ENCODE Project===
In 2012, the [[ENCODE]] project, a research program supported by the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]], reported that 76% of the human genome's non-coding DNA sequences were [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] and that nearly half of the genome was in some way accessible to genetic regulatory proteins such as [[transcription factor]]s.&lt;ref name=pennisi/&gt; However, the suggestion by ENCODE that over 80% of the human genome is biochemically functional has been criticized by other scientists,&lt;ref name="observer"/&gt; who argue that neither accessibility of segments of the genome to transcription factors nor their transcription guarantees that those segments have biochemical function and that their transcription is [[natural selection|selectively advantageous]]. After all, non-functional sections of the genome can be transcribed, given that transcription factors typically bind to short sequences that are found (randomly) all over the whole genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Samuel A.|last2=Jolma|first2=Arttu|last3=Campitelli|first3=Laura F.|last4=Das|first4=Pratyush K.|last5=Yin|first5=Yimeng|last6=Albu|first6=Mihai|last7=Chen|first7=Xiaoting|last8=Taipale|first8=Jussi|last9=Hughes|first9=Timothy R.|last10=Weirauch|first10=Matthew T.|date=02 08, 2018|title=The Human Transcription Factors|journal=Cell|volume=172|issue=4|pages=650–665|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2018.01.029|issn=1097-4172|pmid=29425488}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the much lower estimates of functionality prior to ENCODE were based on '''genomic conservation''' estimates across mammalian lineages.&lt;ref name="eddy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="doolittle2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PalazzoGregory2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="graur" /&gt; Wide-spread transcription and splicing in the human genome has been discussed as another indicator of genetic function in addition to genomic conservation which may miss poorly conserved functional sequences.&lt;ref name="kellis" /&gt; Furthermore, much of the apparent junk DNA is involved in [[epigenetic]] regulation and appears to be necessary for the development of complex organisms.&lt;ref name="Nessa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="extent functionality" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris Epigenetics" /&gt; '''Genetic approaches''' may miss functional elements that do not manifest physically on the organism, '''evolutionary approaches''' have difficulties using accurate multispecies sequence alignments since genomes of even closely related species vary considerably, and with '''biochemical approaches''', though having high reproducibility, the biochemical signatures do not always automatically signify a function.&lt;ref name="kellis" /&gt; Kellis et al. noted that 70% of the transcription coverage was less than 1 transcript per cell (and may thus be based on spurious background transcription). On the other hand, they argued that 12–15% fraction of human DNA may be under functional constraint, and may still be an underestimate when lineage-specific constraints are included. Ultimately genetic, evolutionary, and biochemical approaches can all be used in a complementary way to identify regions that may be functional in human biology and disease.&lt;ref name="kellis" /&gt; Some critics have argued that functionality can only be assessed in reference to an appropriate [[null hypothesis]]. In this case, the null hypothesis would be that these parts of the genome are non-functional and have properties, be it on the basis of conservation or biochemical activity, that would be expected of such regions based on our general understanding of [[molecular evolution]] and [[biochemistry]]. According to these critics, until a region in question has been shown to have additional features, beyond what is expected of the null hypothesis, it should provisionally be labelled as non-functional.&lt;ref name="PalazzoLee2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palazzo AF, Lee ES | title = Non-coding RNA: what is functional and what is junk? | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 6 | pages = 2 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25674102 | pmc = 4306305 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2015.00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Evidence of functionality==

Some non-coding DNA sequences must have some important biological function. This is indicated by [[comparative genomics]] studies that report highly [[Conserved non-coding sequence|conserved regions of non-coding DNA]], sometimes on time-scales of hundreds of millions of years. This implies that these non-coding regions are under strong [[evolution]]ary pressure and [[Natural selection|positive selection]].&lt;ref name=Ludwig&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ludwig MZ | title = Functional evolution of noncoding DNA | journal = Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 634–9 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12433575 | doi = 10.1016/S0959-437X(02)00355-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the genomes of [[human]]s and [[mice]], which diverged from a [[common ancestor]] 65–75 million years ago, protein-coding DNA sequences account for only about 20% of conserved DNA, with the remaining 80% of conserved DNA represented in non-coding regions.&lt;ref name="Cobb et al"/&gt; [[Linkage mapping]] often identifies chromosomal regions associated with a disease with no evidence of functional coding variants of genes within the region, suggesting that disease-causing genetic variants lie in the non-coding DNA.&lt;ref name="Cobb et al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cobb J, Büsst C, Petrou S, Harrap S, Ellis J | title = Searching for functional genetic variants in non-coding DNA | journal = Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology &amp; Physiology | volume = 35 | issue = 4 | pages = 372–5 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18307723 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1681.2008.04880.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of non-coding DNA mutations in cancer was explored in April 2013.&lt;ref name="Khurana et al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khurana E, Fu Y, Colonna V, Mu XJ, Kang HM, Lappalainen T, Sboner A, Lochovsky L, Chen J, Harmanci A, Das J, Abyzov A, Balasubramanian S, Beal K, Chakravarty D, Challis D, Chen Y, Clarke D, Clarke L, Cunningham F, Evani US, Flicek P, Fragoza R, Garrison E, Gibbs R, Gümüş ZH, Herrero J, Kitabayashi N, Kong Y, Lage K, Liluashvili V, Lipkin SM, MacArthur DG, Marth G, Muzny D, Pers TH, Ritchie GR, Rosenfeld JA, Sisu C, Wei X, Wilson M, Xue Y, Yu F, Dermitzakis ET, Yu H, Rubin MA, Tyler-Smith C, Gerstein M | display-authors = 6 | title = Integrative annotation of variants from 1092 humans: application to cancer genomics | journal = Science | volume = 342 | issue = 6154 | pages = 1235587 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24092746 | pmc = 3947637 | doi = 10.1126/science.1235587 | hdl = 11858/00-001M-0000-0019-02F5-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transcription factors ===
{{Main|Transcription factor}}

Some non-coding DNA sequences determine where transcription factors attach.&lt;ref name=Callaway/&gt;  A transcription factor is a protein that binds to specific non-coding DNA sequences, thereby controlling the flow (or transcription) of genetic information from DNA to mRNA.&lt;ref name="pmid9570129"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Latchman DS | title = Transcription factors: an overview | journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 1305–12 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9570129 | pmc = 2002184 | doi = 10.1016/S1357-2725(97)00085-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2128034"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karin M | title = Too many transcription factors: positive and negative interactions | journal = The New Biologist | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 126–31 | date = February 1990 | pmid = 2128034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operators ===
{{Main|Operator (biology)}}

An operator is a segment of DNA to which a [[repressor]] binds. A repressor is a DNA-binding protein that regulates the expression of one or more genes by binding to the operator and blocking the attachment of [[RNA polymerase]] to the promoter, thus preventing transcription of the genes. This blocking of expression is called repression.&lt;ref name=blewin&gt;{{cite book |author=Lewin, Benjamin |title=Genes IV |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1990 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/genesiv00lewi/page/243 243–58] |isbn=978-0-19-854267-4 |edition=4th |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/genesiv00lewi/page/243 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It functions in a very similar way as enhancers, only differing in the inactivation of genes.&lt;ref name="Maston"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maston GA, Evans SK, Green MR | title = Transcriptional regulatory elements in the human genome | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 29–59 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16719718 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.7.080505.115623 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/238dfc85cd5646d13d488908786c56e01cc2e537 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promoters===
{{Main|Promoter (biology)}}

A promoter is a region of DNA that facilitates transcription of a particular gene when a transcription factor binds to it. Promoters are typically located near the genes they regulate and upstream of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Analysis of Biological Networks: Transcriptional Networks – Promoter Sequence Analysis|url=http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~roded/courses/bnet-a06/lec11.pdf|publisher=Tel Aviv University|access-date=30 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insulators===
{{Main|Insulator (genetics) }}

A genetic insulator is a boundary element that plays two distinct roles in gene expression, either as an enhancer-blocking code, or rarely as a barrier against condensed chromatin.  An insulator in a DNA sequence is comparable to a linguistic [[word divider]] such as a comma in a sentence, because the insulator indicates where an enhanced or repressed sequence ends.&lt;ref name="pmid12154228"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burgess-Beusse B, Farrell C, Gaszner M, Litt M, Mutskov V, Recillas-Targa F, Simpson M, West A, Felsenfeld G | title = The insulation of genes from external enhancers and silencing chromatin | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 Suppl 4 | issue =  | pages = 16433–7 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12154228 | pmc = 139905 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.162342499 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...9916433B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Evolution===

Shared sequences of apparently non-functional DNA are a major line of [[evidence of common descent]].&lt;ref name=TO-FAQ&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/molgen/ "Plagiarized Errors and Molecular Genetics"], [[talkorigins]], by Edward E. Max, M.D., Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudogene sequences appear to accumulate mutations more rapidly than coding sequences due to a loss of selective pressure.&lt;ref name="Petrov &amp; Hartl"/&gt; This allows for the creation of mutant alleles that incorporate new functions that may be favored by natural selection; thus, pseudogenes can serve as raw material for [[evolution]] and can be considered "protogenes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Balakirev ES, Ayala FJ | title = Pseudogenes: are they "junk" or functional DNA? | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 37 | issue =  | pages = 123–51 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14616058 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.37.040103.103949 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/10360b4b92468635132c0803eb5876bfda2d8298 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2019 shows that new genes (termed [[De novo gene birth|''de novo'' gene birth]]) can be fashioned from non-coding regions.&lt;ref name="NAT-20191016"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levy |first=Adam |title=How evolution builds genes from scratch - Scientists long assumed that new genes appear when evolution tinkers with old ones. It turns out that natural selection is much more creative. |date=16 October 2019 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=574 |issue=7778 |pages=314–316 |doi=10.1038/d41586-019-03061-x |pmid=31619796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies suggest at least one-tenth of genes could be made in this way.&lt;ref name="NAT-20191016"/&gt;

===Long range correlations===

A statistical distinction between coding and non-coding DNA sequences has been found. It has been observed that nucleotides in non-coding DNA sequences display  long range power law correlations while coding sequences do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peng CK, Buldyrev SV, Goldberger AL, Havlin S, Sciortino F, Simons M, Stanley HE | title = Long-range correlations in nucleotide sequences | journal = Nature | volume = 356 | issue = 6365 | pages = 168–70 | date = March 1992 | pmid = 1301010 | doi = 10.1038/356168a0 | bibcode = 1992Natur.356..168P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Li W, Kaneko K |title=Long-Range Correlation and Partial 1/f&lt;sup&gt;alpha&lt;/sup&gt; Spectrum in a Non-Coding DNA Sequence|journal=Europhys. Lett. |year=1992|volume=17|issue=7|pages=655–660|url=http://chaos.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/papers/bio0/wli.pdf|bibcode = 1992EL.....17..655L |doi = 10.1209/0295-5075/17/7/014 |citeseerx=10.1.1.590.5920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9963221"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buldyrev SV, Goldberger AL, Havlin S, Mantegna RN, Matsa ME, Peng CK, Simons M, Stanley HE | title = Long-range correlation properties of coding and noncoding DNA sequences: GenBank analysis | journal = Physical Review E | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 5084–91 | date = May 1995 | pmid = 9963221 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.51.5084 | bibcode = 1995PhRvE..51.5084B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic anthropology===

Police sometimes gather DNA as evidence for purposes of [[forensic identification]].  As described in ''[[Maryland v. King]]'', a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision:&lt;ref name=USSC&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-207_d18e.pdf Slip opinion] for ''[[Maryland v. King]]'' from the U.S. Supreme Court. {{retrieved|access-date=2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The current standard for forensic DNA testing relies on an analysis of the chromosomes located within the nucleus of all human cells. 'The DNA material in chromosomes is composed of "coding" and "non-coding" regions. The coding regions are known as genes and contain the information necessary for a cell to make proteins. . . . Non-protein coding regions . . . are not related directly to making proteins, [and] have been referred to as "junk" DNA.' The adjective "junk" may mislead the lay person, for in fact this is the DNA region used with near certainty to identify a person.&lt;ref name=USSC/&gt;}}
