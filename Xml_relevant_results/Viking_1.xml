'''''Viking 1''''' was the first of two [[spacecraft]] (along with ''[[Viking 2]]'') sent to [[Mars]] as part of [[NASA]]'s [[Viking program]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20061218"/&gt; On July 20, 1976, it became the second spacecraft to [[soft landing (rocketry)|soft-land]] on Mars, and the first to successfully perform its mission. (The first spacecraft to soft-land on Mars was the Soviet Union's [[Mars 3]] on December 2, 1971, which stopped transmitting after 14.5 seconds.) ''Viking 1'' held the record for the longest Mars surface mission of {{age in days|1976|07|20|1982|11|13}} days (over 6{{frac|1|4}} years)&lt;ref name="NASA-20061218"/&gt; or {{age in sols|1976|07|20|1982|11|13}} [[Timekeeping on Mars#Sols|Martian solar days]],&lt;ref name="NASA-20061218"/&gt; until that record was broken by the [[Opportunity (rover)|''Opportunity'']] rover on May 19, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/newsroom/pressreleases/20100519a.html|title=Mars Exploration Rover|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=mars.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orbiter ===
The instruments of the [[orbiter]] consisted of two [[vidicon]] cameras for imaging (VIS), an infrared spectrometer for water vapor mapping (MAWD) and infrared radiometers for thermal mapping (IRTM).&lt;ref name="Soffen &amp; Snyder"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Soffen, G.A.|author2=Snyder, C.W.|date=August 1976|title=The First Viking Mission to Mars|journal=Science|series=New Series|volume=193|issue=4255|pages=759–766|bibcode=1976Sci...193..759S|doi=10.1126/science.193.4255.759|jstor=1742875|pmid=17747776}}&lt;!--|accessdate= 2008-01-17--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[orbiter]] primary mission ended at the beginning of [[solar conjunction]] on November 5, 1976. The extended mission commenced on December 14, 1976, after solar conjunction.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Operations included close approaches to [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] in February 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=R.E.

On August 7, 1980, ''Viking 1'' Orbiter was running low on attitude control gas and its orbit was raised from 357 × 33943&amp;nbsp;km to 320 × 56000&amp;nbsp;km to prevent impact with Mars and possible contamination until the year 2019. Operations were terminated on August 17, 1980, after 1485 orbits. A 2009 analysis concluded that, while the possibility that ''Viking 1'' had impacted Mars could not be ruled out, it was most likely still in orbit.&lt;ref name=Jefferson&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://enu.kz/repository/2009/AIAA-2009-6002.pdf |title=An Investigation of the Orbital Status of Viking-1 |first=David C |last=Jefferson |first2=Stuart W|last2=Demcak |first3= Pasquale B|last3= Esposito |first4=Gerhard L |last4=Kruizinga |date=August 10–13, 2009 |conference=AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 57,000 images were sent back to Earth.

===Lander===
[[File:Viking Aeroshell - GPN-2000-001903.jpg|left|thumb|''Viking'' Aeroshell]]
The lander and its [[aeroshell]] separated from the orbiter on July 20 at 08:51 UTC. At the time of separation, the lander was orbiting at about {{convert|5|km/s|abbr=off|sp=us}}. The aeroshell's retrorockets fired to begin the lander de-orbit maneuver. After a few hours at about {{convert|300|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} altitude, the lander was reoriented for atmospheric entry. The aeroshell with its ablative [[heat shield]] slowed the craft as it plunged through the [[Atmosphere of Mars|atmosphere]]. During this time, entry science experiments were performed by using a retarding potential analyzer, a [[mass spectrometer]], as well as pressure, temperature, and density sensors.&lt;ref name="Soffen &amp; Snyder" /&gt; At {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}} altitude, traveling at about {{convert|250|m/s|abbr=off|sp=us}}, the 16 m diameter lander parachutes deployed. Seven seconds later the aeroshell was jettisoned, and 8 seconds after that the three lander legs were extended. In 45 seconds the [[parachute]] had slowed the lander to {{convert|60|m/s|abbr=off|sp=us}}. At  {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on}} altitude, retrorockets on the lander itself were ignited and, 40 seconds later at about {{convert|2.4|m/s|abbr=on}}, the lander arrived on Mars with a relatively light jolt. The legs had honeycomb aluminum shock absorbers to soften the landing.&lt;ref name="Soffen &amp; Snyder"/&gt;

The landing rockets used an 18-nozzle design to spread the hydrogen and nitrogen exhaust over a large area. NASA calculated that this approach would mean that the surface would not be heated by more than one 1&amp;nbsp;°C (1.8&amp;nbsp;°F), and that it would move no more than {{convert|1|mm|sigfig=1|abbr=off|sp=us}} of surface material.&lt;ref name="NSSDCA" /&gt; Since most of Viking's experiments focused on the surface material a more straightforward design would not have served.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Transmission of the first surface image began 25 seconds after landing and took about four minutes (see below). During these minutes the lander activated itself. It erected a high-gain antenna pointed toward Earth for direct communication and deployed a meteorology boom mounted with sensors. In the next seven minutes the second picture of the 300° panoramic scene (displayed below) was taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mutch, T.A.|display-authors=etal|date=August 1976|title=The Surface of Mars: The View from the Viking 1 Lander|journal=Science|series=New Series|volume=193|issue=4255|pages=791–801|bibcode=1976Sci...193..791M|doi=10.1126/science.193.4255.791|jstor=1742881|pmid=17747782}}&lt;!--|accessdate= 2008-01-17 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the day after the landing the first color picture of the surface of Mars (displayed below) was taken. The seismometer failed to uncage, and a sampler arm locking pin was stuck and took five days to shake out. Otherwise, all experiments functioned normally. The lander had two means of returning data to Earth: a relay link up to the orbiter and back, and by using a direct link to Earth. The data capacity of the relay link was about 10 times higher than the direct link.&lt;ref name="Soffen &amp; Snyder"/&gt;

The lander had two facsimile cameras; three analyses for metabolism, growth or photosynthesis; a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GCMS); an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer; pressure, temperature and wind velocity sensors; a three-axis seismometer; a magnet on a sampler observed by the cameras; and various engineering sensors.&lt;ref name="Soffen &amp; Snyder"/&gt;

The ''Viking 1'' lander was named the '''Thomas Mutch Memorial Station''' in January 1982 in honor of [[Thomas A. Mutch]], the leader of the Viking imaging team. The lander operated for 2245 [[Timekeeping on Mars#Sols|sol]]s (about 2306 Earth days or 6 years) until November 11, 1982, (sol  {{age in sols|1975|07|20|1982|11|11}}), when a faulty command sent by ground control resulted in loss of contact. The command was intended to uplink new battery charging software to improve the lander's deteriorating battery capacity, but it inadvertently overwrote data used by the antenna pointing software. Attempts to contact the lander during the next four months, based on the presumed antenna position, were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. J.

=== Search for life ===
''Viking 1'' carried a biology experiment whose purpose was to look for evidence of life.  The [[Viking spacecraft biological experiments|''Viking'' spacecraft biological experiments]] weighed 15.5&amp;nbsp;kg (34&amp;nbsp;lbs) and consisted of three subsystems: the [[Viking lander biological experiments#Pyrolytic release|pyrolytic release]] experiment (PR), the labeled release experiment (LR), and the gas exchange experiment (GEX).  In addition, independent of the biology experiments, Viking carried a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GCMS) that could measure the composition and abundance of organic compounds in the Martian soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msss.com/http/ps/life/life.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020034248/http://www.msss.com/http/ps/life/life.html|url-status=dead|title=Life on Mars|archivedate=October 20, 2014|website=www.msss.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The results were surprising and interesting: the GCMS gave a negative result; the PR gave a negative result, the GEX gave a negative result, and the LR gave a positive result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/news/mars-life-00g.html Viking Data May Hide New Evidence For Life.] Barry E.

[[Gravitational time dilation]] is a phenomenon predicted by the theory of [[General Relativity]] whereby time passes more slowly in regions of lower [[gravitational potential]]. Scientists used the lander to test this hypothesis, by sending radio signals to the lander on Mars, and instructing the lander to send back signals, in cases which sometimes included the signal passing close to the Sun. Scientists found that the observed [[Shapiro delay]]s of the signals matched the predictions of General Relativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
