[[File:Solar power satellite sandwich or abascus concept.jpg|alt=|thumb|NASA Integrated Symmetrical Concentrator SPS concept]]
'''Space-based solar power''' ('''SBSP''') is the concept of collecting [[solar power]] in [[outer space]] and distributing it to [[Earth]]. Potential advantages of collecting solar energy in space include a higher collection rate and a longer collection period due to the lack of a diffusing [[atmosphere]], and the possibility of placing a solar collector in an orbiting location where there is no night. A considerable fraction of incoming [[solar energy]] (55–60%) is lost on its way through the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] by the effects of [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] and absorption. Space-based solar power systems convert [[sunlight]] to [[microwave]]s outside the atmosphere, avoiding these losses and the downtime due to the [[Earth's rotation]], but at great cost due to the expense of launching material into orbit. SBSP is considered a form of [[Sustainable energy|sustainable or green energy]], [[renewable energy]], and is occasionally considered among [[climate engineering]] proposals.  It is attractive to those seeking large-scale solutions to [[Global warming|anthropogenic climate change]] or fossil fuel depletion (such as [[peak oil]]).

Various SBSP proposals have been researched since the early 1970s,&lt;ref name="ESA-SBSP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/sps.html |title=Space-based solar power |work=[[ESA]]–Advanced Concepts Team |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DOE-SBSP"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.energy.gov/articles/space-based-solar-power |title=Space-Based Solar Power |work=[[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) |date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but none are economically viable with present-day space launch infrastructure. Some technologists speculate that this may change in the distant future if an off-world industrial base were to be developed that could manufacture solar power satellites out of asteroids or lunar material, or if radical new space launch technologies other than rocketry should become available in the future.

Besides the cost of implementing such a system, SBSP also introduces several technological hurdles, including the problem of transmitting energy from orbit to Earth's surface for use. Since wires extending from [[Earth#Surface|Earth's surface]] to an orbiting satellite are neither practical nor feasible with current technology, SBSP designs generally include the use of some manner of [[wireless power transmission]] with its concomitant conversion inefficiencies, as well as land use concerns for the necessary antenna stations to receive the energy at Earth's surface. The collecting satellite would convert solar energy into electrical energy on board, powering a [[microwave]] transmitter or [[laser]] emitter, and transmit this energy to a collector (or microwave [[rectenna]]) on Earth's surface. Contrary to appearances of SBSP in popular novels and video games, most designs propose beam energy densities that are not harmful if human beings were to be inadvertently exposed, such as if a transmitting satellite's beam were to wander off-course. But the vast size of the receiving antennas that would be necessary would still require large blocks of land near the end users to be procured and dedicated to this purpose. The service life of space-based collectors in the face of challenges from long-term exposure to the space environment, including degradation from [[Radiation damage|radiation]] and [[micrometeoroid]] damage, could also become a concern for SBSP.

SBSP is being actively pursued by Japan, China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/china-plans-a-solar-power-play-in-space-that-nasa-abandoned-long-ago.html |title=China plans a solar power play in space that NASA abandoned decades ago |authors=Eric Rosenbaum and Donovan Russo |date=March 17, 2019 |website=CNBC.com |access-date=19 March 2019 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russia.  In 2008, Japan passed its Basic Space Law which established Space Solar Power as a national goal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/utyuu/basic_plan.pdf|title=Basic Plan for Space Policy|date=June 2, 2009|access-date=May 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and JAXA has a roadmap to commercial SBSP.  In 2015, the [[China Academy for Space Technology]] (CAST) showcased their roadmap at the International Space Development Conference.

== History ==
[[File:Space to ground microwave, laser pilot beam.png|thumb|A laser pilot beam guides the microwave power transmission to a rectenna]]

In 1941, science fiction writer [[Isaac Asimov]] published&lt;!--where?--&gt; the science fiction short story "[[Reason (short story)|Reason]]", in which a space station transmits energy collected from the Sun to various planets using microwave beams. The SBSP concept, originally known as satellite solar-power system (SSPS), was first described in November 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.162.3856.857 |pmid=17769070 |title=Power from the Sun: Its Future |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3856 |pages=857–61 |year=1968 |last1=Glaser |first1=P. E. |bibcode=1968Sci...162..857G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 [[Peter Glaser]] was granted U.S. patent number 3,781,647 for his method of transmitting power over long distances (e.g. from an SPS to Earth's surface) using [[microwave]]s from a very large antenna (up to one square kilometer) on the satellite to a much larger one, now known as a [[rectenna]], on the ground.&lt;ref name="Glaser" /&gt;

Glaser then was a vice president at [[Arthur D. Little]], Inc. NASA signed a contract with ADL to lead four other companies in a broader study in 1974. They found that, while the concept had several major problems&amp;nbsp;– chiefly the expense of putting the required materials in orbit and the lack of experience on projects of this scale in space&amp;nbsp;– it showed enough promise to merit further investigation and research.&lt;ref name="FS"&gt;[[Peter Glaser|Glaser, P. E.]], Maynard, O. E., Mackovciak, J., and Ralph, E. L, Arthur D. Little, Inc., "Feasibility study of a satellite solar power station", NASA CR-2357, NTIS N74-17784, February 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1978 and 1986, the [[United States Congress|Congress]] authorized the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DoE) and [[NASA]] to jointly investigate the concept. They organized the Satellite Power System Concept Development and Evaluation Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/1978DOESPS-ProgramPlanJuly1977-August1980.pdf Satellite Power System Concept Development and Evaluation Program July 1977 - August 1980.

=== Discontinuation ===

The project was not continued with the change in administrations after the 1980 US Federal elections. The [[Office of Technology Assessment]] concluded that "Too little is currently known about the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of SPS to make a sound decision whether to proceed with its development and deployment. In addition, without further research an SPS demonstration or systems-engineering verification program would be a high-risk venture."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/1981-OTA-SolarPowerSatellites.pdf Solar Power Satellites. Office of Technology Assessment, August 1981. 297 pages.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, NASA conducted its "Fresh Look" study to examine the modern state of SBSP feasibility. In assessing "What has changed" since the DOE study, NASA asserted that the "US National Space Policy now calls for NASA to make significant investments in technology (not a particular vehicle) to drive the costs of ETO ''[Earth to Orbit]'' transportation down dramatically. This is, of course, an absolute requirement of space solar power."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/1997-Mankins-FreshLookAtSpaceSolarPower.pdf A Fresh Look at Space Solar Power: New Architectures, Concepts, and Technologies. John C. Mankins. International Astronautical Federation IAF-97-R.2.03. 12 pages.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Pete Worden]] of NASA claimed that space-based solar is about five orders of magnitude more expensive than solar power from the Arizona desert, with a major cost being the transportation of materials to orbit. Worden referred to possible solutions as speculative, and which would not be available for decades at the earliest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|title= Dr. Pete Worden on thespaceshow|url= http://www.thespaceshow.com/detail.asp?q=1127|publisher= thespaceshow.com|date= 23 March 2009|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120707205702/http://www.thespaceshow.com/detail.asp?q=1127|archivedate= 7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Nov 2, 2012, China proposed space collaboration with India that mentioned SBSP, " may be Space-based Solar Power initiative so that both India and China can work for long term association with proper funding along with other willing space faring nations to bring space solar power to earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-11-02/india/34877401_1_space-solar-power-space-collaboration-v-ponraj | work=The Times Of India | title=China proposes space collaboration with India - The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Feb. 2019, China (CAST) announced long-term plans to build power satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/asia/plans-for-first-chinese-solar-power-station-in-space-revealed-20190214-p50xtg.html| work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Plans for first Chinese solar power station in space revealed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Space Solar Power Exploratory Research and Technology program ===

{{main|Space Solar Power Exploratory Research and Technology program}}
[[File:Solar power satellite sandwich or abascus concept.jpg|thumb|SERT Integrated Symmetrical Concentrator SPS concept.NASA]]

In 1999, NASA's Space Solar Power Exploratory Research and Technology program (SERT) was initiated for the following purposes:
* Perform design studies of selected flight demonstration concepts.
* Evaluate studies of the general feasibility, design, and requirements.
* Create conceptual designs of subsystems that make use of advanced SSP technologies to benefit future space or terrestrial applications.
* Formulate a preliminary plan of action for the U.S. (working with international partners) to undertake an aggressive technology initiative.
* Construct technology development and demonstration roadmaps for critical Space Solar Power (SSP) elements.

SERT went about developing a solar power satellite (SPS) concept for a future [[gigawatt]] space power system, to provide electrical power by converting the Sun's energy and beaming it to Earth's surface, and provided a conceptual development path that would utilize current technologies. SERT proposed an [[Inflatable space structures|inflatable]] [[photovoltaic]] [[Textile manufacturing terminology#G|gossamer]] structure with concentrator lenses or [[Concentrating solar power|solar]] [[heat engine]]s to convert [[sunlight]] into electricity. The program looked both at systems in [[sun-synchronous orbit]] and [[geosynchronous orbit]]. Some of SERT's conclusions:
* The increasing global energy demand is likely to continue for many decades resulting in new power plants of all sizes being built.
* The environmental impact of those plants and their impact on world energy supplies and geopolitical relationships can be problematic.
* Renewable energy is a compelling approach, both philosophically and in engineering terms.
* Many renewable energy sources are limited in their ability to affordably provide the base load power required for global industrial development and prosperity, because of inherent land and water requirements.
* Based on their Concept Definition Study, space solar power concepts may be ready to reenter the discussion.
* Solar power satellites should no longer be envisioned as requiring unimaginably large initial investments in fixed infrastructure before the emplacement of productive power plants can begin.
* Space solar power systems appear to possess many significant environmental advantages when compared to alternative approaches.
* The economic viability of space solar power systems depends on many factors and the successful development of various new technologies (not least of which is the availability of much lower cost access to space than has been available); however, the same can be said of many other advanced power technologies options.
* Space solar power may well emerge as a serious candidate among the options for meeting the energy demands of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Space Solar Power Satellite Technology Development at the Glenn Research Center—An Overview. James E. Dudenhoefer and Patrick J. George, NASA [[Glenn Research Center]], Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Comparison of orbital launch systems|Launch costs]] in the range of $100–$200 per kilogram of payload from [[low Earth orbit]] to [[Geosynchronous orbit]] are needed if SPS is to be economically viable.&lt;ref name="Mankins" /&gt;

=== Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ===
The May 2014 [[IEEE]] Spectrum magazine carried a lengthy article "It's Always Sunny in Space" by Susumu Sasaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/solar/how-japan-plans-to-build-an-orbital-solar-farm|title=How Japan Plans to Build an Orbital Solar Farm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated, "It's been the subject of many previous studies and the stuff of sci-fi for decades, but space-based solar power could at last become a reality—and within 25 years, according to a proposal from researchers at the [[Tokyo]]-based [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA)."

JAXA announced on 12 March 2015 that they wirelessly beamed 1.8 kilowatts 50 meters to a small receiver by converting electricity to microwaves and then back to electricity. This is the standard plan for this type of power.&lt;ref name="ATarantola"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Andrew | last=Tarantola| title=Scientists make strides in beaming solar power from space |date=12 March 2015 |volume=162 |issue=3856 |pages=857–861 |format=PDF |url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/03/12/scientists-make-strides-in-beaming-solar-power-from-space/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PKT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/article-177982-Japan-space-scientists-make-wireless-energy-breakthrough|title=Japan space scientists make wireless energy breakthrough}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 March 2015 Mitsubishi Heavy Industries demonstrated transmission of 10 kilowatts (kW) of power to a receiver unit located at a distance of 500 meters (m) away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mhi-global.com/news/story/1503121879.html|title = MHI Successfully Completes Ground Demonstration Testing of Wireless Power Transmission Technology for SSPS|date = 12 March 2015|accessdate = |website = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

=== Advantages ===

The SBSP concept is attractive because space has several major advantages over the Earth's surface for the collection of solar power:
* It is always [[noon#solar noon|solar noon]] in space and full sun.
* Collecting surfaces could receive much more intense sunlight, owing to the lack of obstructions such as [[atmospheric gasses]], [[cloud]]s, dust and other weather events. Consequently, the intensity in orbit is approximately 144% of the maximum attainable intensity on Earth's surface.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
* A satellite could be illuminated over 99% of the time, and be in Earth's [[shadow]] a maximum of only 72 minutes per night at the spring and fall equinoxes at local midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|date=August 1981| title = Solar Power Satellites| page=66| place = Washington, D.C.| publisher = Congress of the U.S., Office of Technology Assessment| id = [[LCCN]] 81600129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Orbiting satellites can be exposed to a consistently high degree of solar [[radiation]], generally for 24 hours per day, whereas earth surface solar panels currently collect power for an average of 29% of the day.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Collection at Earth's [[poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|poles]] can take place for 24 hours per day, but there are very small loads demanded at the poles.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Power could be relatively quickly redirected directly to areas that need it most. A collecting satellite could possibly direct power on demand to different surface locations based on geographical [[baseload]] or [[peak load]] power needs.
* Elimination of plant and wildlife interference.
* With very large scale implementations, especially at lower altitudes, it potentially can reduce incoming solar radiation reaching earth's surface. This would be desirable for counteracting the effects of [[global warming]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

=== Disadvantages ===

The SBSP concept also has a number of problems:
* The large cost of launching a satellite into space.  For 6.5&amp;nbsp;kg/kW, the cost to place a power satellite in GEO cannot exceed $200/kg if the power cost is to be competitive.
* Microwave optic requires GW scale due to [[Airy disk]] beam spreading. Typically a 1&amp;nbsp;km transmitting disk at 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz spreads out to 10&amp;nbsp;km at Earth distance.

* Inaccessibility: Maintenance of an earth-based solar panel is relatively simple, but construction and maintenance on a solar panel in space would typically be done telerobotically. In addition to cost, astronauts working in GEO (geosynchronous Earth orbit) are exposed to unacceptably high radiation dangers and risk and cost about one thousand times more than the same task done telerobotically.
* The space environment is hostile; PV panels (if used) suffer about 8 times the degradation they would on Earth (except at orbits that are protected by the magnetosphere).&lt;ref&gt;In space, panels suffer rapid erosion due to high energy particles,[http://www.solarstorms.org/Svulnerability.html "Solar Panel Degradation"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929152905/http://www.solarstorms.org/Svulnerability.html |date=2011-09-29 }} whereas on Earth, commercial panels degrade at a rate around 0.25% a year.[http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/musings/testing-thirty-year-old-photovoltaic-module "Testing a Thirty-Year-Old Photovoltaic Module"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[Image:Solardisk.jpg|thumb|Artist's concept of a solar disk on top of a LEO to GEO electrically powered [[space tug]].]]

Space-based solar power essentially consists of three elements:&lt;ref name="DOE-SBSP" /&gt;
# collecting solar energy in space with reflectors or inflatable mirrors onto [[solar cell]]s or heaters for thermal systems
# [[wireless power transmission]] to Earth via [[microwave]] or [[laser]]
# receiving power on Earth via a [[rectenna]], a microwave antenna

The space-based portion will not need to support itself against gravity (other than relatively weak tidal stresses). It needs no protection from terrestrial wind or weather, but will have to cope with space hazards such as [[micrometeor]]s and [[solar flares]]. Two basic methods of conversion have been studied: [[photovoltaic]] (PV) and [[Solar thermal energy|solar dynamic]] (SD). Most analyses of SBSP have focused on photovoltaic conversion using solar cells that directly convert sunlight into electricity. Solar dynamic uses mirrors to concentrate light on a boiler. The use of solar dynamic could reduce mass per watt. [[Wireless power transmission]] was proposed early on as a means to transfer energy from collection to the Earth's surface, using either microwave or laser radiation at a variety of frequencies.

=== Microwave power transmission ===

[[William C. Brown]] demonstrated in 1964, during [[Walter Cronkite]]'s [[CBS]] News program, a microwave-powered model [[helicopter]] that received all the power it needed for flight from a microwave beam. Between 1969 and 1975, Bill Brown was technical director of a [[JPL]] [[Raytheon]] program that beamed 30 [[kilowatt|kW]] of power over a distance of {{convert|1|mi|km}} at 9.6% efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dickenson |first1=R.M. |title=Evaluation of a Microwave High-Power Reception-Conversion Array for Wireless Power Transmission |date=1 September 1975 |publisher=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory |pages=8–24 |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760004119.pdf |accessdate=2 June 2019 |format=JPL Technical Memorandum 33-741 |quote=Because of the small size of the array relative to the 26-m-diameter antenna tubular beam, only about 11.3% of the klystron transmitter output is incident on the array (see Fig. 12) and is thus available for  collection and conversion to DC output.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/TMTT.1984.1132833 |title=The History of Power Transmission by Radio Waves |journal=IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques |volume=32 |issue=9 |pages=1230–1242 |year=1984 |last1=Brown |first1=W.C. |bibcode=1984ITMTT..32.1230B |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/dfedf530cf3f3bb023c2e3fb7ca57ce94dfa66cb }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Comparison of Laser and Microwave Power Transmission for Space Station Power.gif|thumb|Comparison of laser and microwave power transmission. NASA diagram]]

More recently, microwave power transmission has been demonstrated, in conjunction with solar energy capture, between a mountain top in Maui and the island of Hawaii (92 miles away), by a team under [[John C. Mankins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nss.org/news/releases/pc20080912.html POINT-TO-POINT WIRELESS POWER TRANSPORTATION IN HAWAII].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/09/visionary-beams/ Researchers Beam 'Space' Solar Power in Hawaii] by Loretta Hidalgo, September 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
Technological challenges in terms of array layout, single radiation element design, and overall efficiency, as well as the associated theoretical limits are presently a subject of research, as it was demonstrated by the Special Session on "Analysis of Electromagnetic Wireless Systems for Solar Power Transmission" held during the 2010 [[IEEE]] Symposium on Antennas and Propagation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090726090427/http://www.apsursi2010.org/?m=page&amp;id=47 2010 IEEE Symposium on Antennas and Propagation - Special Session List]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a useful overview was published, covering technologies and issues associated with microwave power transmission from space to ground.  It includes an introduction to SPS, current research and future prospects.&lt;ref name= Sasaki&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/JPROC.2013.2246851 |title=Microwave Power Transmission Technologies for Solar Power Satellites |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=1438 |year=2013 |last1=Sasaki |first1=Susumu |last2=Tanaka |first2=Koji |last3=Maki |first3=Ken-Ichiro }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, a review of current methodologies and technologies for the design of antenna arrays for microwave power transmission appeared in the Proceedings of the IEEE.&lt;ref name= MASSA&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/JPROC.2013.2245491 |title=Array Designs for Long-Distance Wireless Power Transmission: State-of-the-Art and Innovative Solutions |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=1464 |year=2013 |last1=Massa |first1=Andrea |last2=Oliveri |first2=Giacomo |last3=Viani |first3=Federico |last4=Rocca |first4=Paolo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laser power beaming ===

[[Laser]] power beaming was envisioned by some at NASA as a stepping stone to further industrialization of space. In the 1980s, researchers at NASA worked on the potential use of lasers for space-to-space power beaming, focusing primarily on the development of a solar-powered laser. In 1989 it was suggested that power could also be usefully beamed by laser from Earth to space. In 1991, the SELENE project (SpacE Laser ENErgy) had begun, which included the study of [[laser power beaming]] for supplying power to a lunar base. The SELENE program was a two-year research effort, but the cost of taking the concept to operational status was too high, and the official project ended in 1993 before reaching a space-based demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://powerweb.grc.nasa.gov/pvsee/programs/pvlaser_overview.html Glenn Involvement with Laser Power Beaming-- Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117234426/http://powerweb.grc.nasa.gov/pvsee/programs/pvlaser_overview.html |date=2006-11-17 }} NASA Glenn Research Center&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 the use of an Earth-based laser to power an electric thruster for space propulsion was proposed by Grant Logan, with technical details worked out in 1989. He proposed using diamond solar cells operating at 600 degrees{{clarify|date=November 2018|reason=F or C?}} to convert [[ultraviolet]] laser light.

=== Orbital location ===

The main advantage of locating a space power station in geostationary orbit is that the antenna geometry stays constant, and so keeping the antennas lined up is simpler. Another advantage is that nearly continuous power transmission is immediately available as soon as the first space power station is placed in orbit, LEO requires several satellites before they are producing nearly continuous power.

Power beaming from [[geostationary orbit]] by microwaves carries the difficulty that the required 'optical aperture' sizes are very large. For example, the 1978 NASA SPS study required a 1-km diameter transmitting antenna, and a 10&amp;nbsp;km diameter receiving rectenna, for a microwave beam at [[ISM band|2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz]]. These sizes can be somewhat decreased by using shorter wavelengths, although they have increased [[Water absorption|atmospheric absorption]] and even potential beam blockage by rain or water droplets. Because of the [[thinned array curse]], it is not possible to make a narrower beam by combining the beams of several smaller satellites. The large size of the transmitting and receiving antennas means that the minimum practical power level for an SPS will necessarily be high; small SPS systems will be possible, but uneconomic.{{Original research inline|date=March 2017}}

A collection of LEO ([[Low Earth Orbit]]) space power stations has been proposed as a precursor to GEO ([[Geostationary Orbit]]) space-based solar power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earth-based receiver ===

The Earth-based [[rectenna]] would likely consist of many short [[dipole antenna]]s connected via [[diode]]s. Microwave broadcasts from the satellite would be received in the dipoles with about 85% efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/webaccess/CommSpaceTrans/SpaceCommTransSec38/CommSpacTransSec38.html|title=CommSpacTransSec38.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a conventional microwave antenna, the reception efficiency is better, but its cost and complexity are also considerably greater. Rectennas would likely be several kilometers across.

=== In space applications ===

A laser SBSP could also power a base or vehicles on the surface of the Moon or Mars, saving on mass costs to land the power source. A spacecraft or another satellite could also be powered by the same means. In a 2012 report presented to NASA on Space Solar Power, the author mentions another potential use for the technology behind Space Solar Power could be for Solar Electric Propulsion Systems that could be used for interplanetary human exploration missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mankins|first=John|title=SPS-ALPHA: The First Practical Solar Power Satellite via Arbitrarily Large Phased Array|url=http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/SPS_Alpha_2012_Mankins.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nss.org/settlement/ssp/library/1989-SecondBeamedSpacePowerWorkshop.pdf | title=Second Beamed Space-Power Workshop | publisher=Nasa | year=1989 | pages=near page 290}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://spirit.as.utexas.edu/~fiso/telecon/Brandhorst_10-27-10/Brandhorst_10-27-10.pdf | title=Options for Lunar Power Beaming | publisher=FISO group | work=Brandhorst | date=October 27, 2010 | author=Henry W. Brandhorst, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Launch costs ==

One problem for the SBSP concept is the cost of space launches and the amount of material that would need to be launched.

Much of the material launched need not be delivered to its eventual orbit immediately, which raises the possibility that high efficiency (but slower) engines could move SPS material from LEO to GEO at an acceptable cost. Examples include [[ion thruster]]s or [[nuclear propulsion]].

To give an idea of the scale of the problem, assuming a solar panel mass of 20&amp;nbsp;kg per kilowatt (without considering the mass of the supporting structure, antenna, or any significant mass reduction of any focusing mirrors) a 4 GW power station would weigh about 80,000 [[metric tons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://energy.gov/articles/space-based-solar-power|title=Space-Based Solar Power|work=energy.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which would, in current circumstances, be launched from the Earth. This is, however, far from the state of the art for flown spacecraft, which as of 2015 was 150W/kg (6.7&amp;nbsp;kg/kW), and improving rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/meetings/aug2015/presentations/day-2/11_beauchamp.pdf|title=Solar Power and Energy Storage for Planetary Missions|date=August 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very lightweight designs could likely achieve 1&amp;nbsp;kg/kW,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.you.com.au/news/2005.htm| title= Case For Space Based Solar Power Development|date=August 2003| accessdate=2006-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning 4,000 metric tons for the solar panels for the same 4 GW capacity station.  Beyond the mass of the panels, overhead (including boosting to the desired orbit and stationkeeping) must be added.

To these costs must be added the environmental impact of heavy space launch missions, if such costs are to be used in comparison to earth-based energy production. For comparison, the direct cost of a new coal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/cctc/ccpi/pubs/2006_program_update.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110050309/http://www.netl.doe.gov/technologies/coalpower/cctc/ccpi/pubs/2006_program_update.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-01-10|title=2006_program_update}}&lt;/ref&gt; or nuclear power plant ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion per GW (not including the [[Environmental full-cost accounting|full cost]] to the environment from CO2 emissions or storage of spent nuclear fuel, respectively).

== Building from space ==

=== From lunar materials launched in orbit ===

[[Gerard K. O'Neill|Gerard O'Neill]], noting the problem of high launch costs in the early 1970s, proposed building the SPS's in orbit with materials from the [[Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerard K. O'Neill|O'Neill, Gerard K.]], "The High Frontier, Human Colonies in Space", {{ISBN|0-688-03133-1}}, P.57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colonization of the Moon#Launch costs|Launch costs]] from the Moon are potentially much lower than from Earth, due to the lower [[gravity]] and lack of [[atmospheric drag]]. This 1970s proposal assumed the then-advertised future launch costing of NASA's space shuttle. This approach would require substantial up front capital investment to establish [[mass driver]]s on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgrdAUFFMrA|title=Colonizing Space - '70s Style!|first=|last=|date=11 December 2009|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, on 30 April 1979, the Final Report ("Lunar Resources Utilization for Space Construction") by General Dynamics' Convair Division, under NASA contract NAS9-15560, concluded that use of lunar resources would be cheaper than Earth-based materials for a system of as few as thirty Solar Power Satellites of 10GW capacity each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19830077470_1983077470.pdf| title=Lunar Resources Utilization for Space Construction| year=1979| author=General Dynamics Convair Division| id=GDC-ASP79-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, when it became obvious NASA's launch cost estimates for the space shuttle were grossly optimistic, O'Neill et al. published another route to manufacturing using lunar materials with much lower startup costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Neill | first1 = Gerard K. | authorlink = Gerard K. O'Neill | authorlink3 = Brian O'Leary | last2 = Driggers | first2 = G. | last3 = O'Leary | first3 = B. | year = 1980 | title = New Routes to Manufacturing in Space | url = | journal = Astronautics and Aeronautics | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 46–51 | bibcode = 1980AsAer..18...46G }} Several scenarios for the buildup of industry in space are described. One scenario involves a manufacturing facility, manned by a crew of three, entirely on the lunar surface. Another scenario involves a fully automated manufacturing facility, remotely supervised from the earth, with provision for occasional visits by repair crews. A third case involves a manned facility on the Moon for operating a mass-driver launcher to transport lunar materials to a collection point in space and for replicating mass-drivers.&lt;/ref&gt; This 1980s SPS concept relied less on human presence in space and more on partially [[Self-replicating machine#Advanced Automation for Space Missions|self-replicating systems]] on the lunar surface under [[Telepresence|remote control]] of workers stationed on Earth. The high [[net energy gain]] of this proposal derives from the Moon's much shallower [[gravitational well]].

Having a relatively cheap per pound source of raw materials from space would lessen the concern for low mass designs and result in a different sort of SPS being built. The low cost per pound of lunar materials in O'Neill's vision would be supported by using lunar material to manufacture more facilities in orbit than just solar power satellites. Advanced techniques for launching from the Moon may reduce the cost of building a solar power satellite from lunar materials.  Some proposed techniques include the lunar mass driver and the [[lunar space elevator]], first described by Jerome Pearson.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Jerome; Eugene Levin, John Oldson and Harry Wykes (2005). Lunar Space Elevators for Cislunar Space Development Phase I Final Technical Report (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;  It would require establishing [[silicon]] mining and solar cell manufacturing facilities on the [[Moon]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

=== On the Moon ===

=== From an asteroid ===

[[Asteroid mining]] has also been seriously considered. A NASA design study&lt;ref&gt;Space Resources, NASA SP-509, Vol 1.&lt;/ref&gt; evaluated a 10,000-ton mining vehicle (to be assembled in orbit) that would return a 500,000-ton asteroid fragment to geostationary orbit. Only about 3,000 tons of the mining ship would be traditional aerospace-grade payload. The rest would be reaction mass for the mass-driver engine, which could be arranged to be the spent rocket stages used to launch the payload. Assuming that 100% of the returned asteroid was useful, and that the asteroid miner itself couldn't be reused, that represents nearly a 95% reduction in launch costs. However, the true merits of such a method would depend on a thorough mineral survey of the candidate asteroids; thus far, we have only estimates of their composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/spaceres/IV-2.html|title=  Retrieval of Asteroidal Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposal is to capture the asteroid [[99942 Apophis|Apophis]] into earth orbit and convert it into 150 solar power satellites of 5 GW each or the larger asteroid 1999 AN10 which is 50x the size of Apophis and large enough to build 7,500 5-Gigawatt Solar Power Satellites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nss.org/settlement/asteroids/capture.html | title=Technologies for Asteroid Capture into Earth Orbit | date=May 2011 | author=Stephen D.

The use of [[Microwave power transmission|microwave transmission of power]] has been the most controversial issue in considering any SPS design. At the Earth's surface, a suggested microwave beam would have a maximum intensity at its center, of 23&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (less than 1/4 the [[Sunlight#Intensity in the Solar System|solar irradiation constant]]), and an intensity of less than 1&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; outside the rectenna fenceline (the receiver's perimeter).&lt;ref name="intensity"&gt;{{cite journal| first= G.M.. .| last= Hanley. | title= Satellite Concept Power Systems (SPS) Definition Study

&lt;/ref&gt; These compare with current United States [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] (OSHA) workplace exposure limits for microwaves, which are 10&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/radiofrequencyradiation/standards.html Radiofrequency and Microwave Radiation Standards] interpretation of General Industry (29 CFR 1910) 1910 Subpart G, Occupational Health and Environmental Control 1910.97, Non-ionizing radiation.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=March 2017}} - the limit itself being expressed in voluntary terms and ruled unenforceable for Federal OSHA enforcement purposes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} A beam of this intensity is therefore at its center, of a similar magnitude to current safe workplace levels, even for long term or indefinite exposure.{{Original research inline|date=March 2017}} Outside the receiver, it is far less than the OSHA long-term levels&lt;ref&gt;2081 A Hopeful View of the Human Future, by [[Gerard K. O'Neill]], {{ISBN|0-671-24257-1}}, P. 182-183&lt;/ref&gt; Over 95% of the beam energy will fall on the rectenna. The remaining microwave energy will be absorbed and dispersed well within standards currently imposed upon microwave emissions around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1109/APS.1983.1149129 |chapter=A microwave antenna method of measuring the effect of metal-framed spectacles on microwaves near the eyes |title=1983 Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium |volume=21 |pages=253–256 |year=1983 |last1=Griffin |first1=D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important for system efficiency that as much of the microwave radiation as possible be focused on the rectenna. Outside the rectenna, microwave intensities rapidly decrease, so nearby towns or other human activity should be completely unaffected.&lt;ref name="IEEE 602864"/&gt;

Exposure to the beam is able to be minimized in other ways. On the ground, physical access is controllable (e.g., via fencing), and typical aircraft flying through the beam provide passengers with a protective metal shell (i.e., a [[Faraday Cage]]), which will intercept the microwaves. Other aircraft ([[balloon]]s, [[ultralight]], etc.) can avoid exposure by observing airflight control spaces, as is currently done for military and other controlled airspace. The microwave beam intensity at ground level in the center of the beam would be designed and physically built into the system; simply, the transmitter would be too far away and too small to be able to increase the intensity to unsafe levels, even in principle.

In addition, a design constraint is that the microwave beam must not be so intense as to injure wildlife, particularly birds. Experiments with deliberate microwave irradiation at reasonable levels have failed to show negative effects even over multiple generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://permanent.com/p-sps-bm.htm|title=Beam Effects}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggestions have been made to locate rectennas offshore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Solar power satellite offshore rectenna study |journal=Final Report Rice Univ |year=1980 |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19810004047.pdf |bibcode=1980ruht.reptT..... }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |hdl=2060/19820014867 |first=J.

A commonly proposed approach to ensuring fail-safe beam targeting is to use a retrodirective [[phased array]] antenna/rectenna. A "pilot" microwave beam emitted from the center of the rectenna on the ground establishes a phase front at the transmitting antenna. There, circuits in each of the antenna's subarrays compare the pilot beam's phase front with an internal clock phase to control the phase of the outgoing signal. This forces the transmitted beam to be centered precisely on the rectenna and to have a high degree of phase uniformity; if the pilot beam is lost for any reason (if the transmitting antenna is turned away from the rectenna, for example) the phase control value fails and the microwave power beam is automatically defocused.&lt;ref name="IEEE 602864"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1109/MWSYM.1997.602864 |chapter=Automatic beam steered active antenna receiver |title=1997 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest |volume=2 |pages=599–602 |year=1997 |last1=Gupta |first1=S. |last2=Fusco |first2=V.F. |isbn=978-0-7803-3814-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a system would be physically incapable of focusing its power beam anywhere that did not have a pilot beam transmitter. The long-term effects of beaming power through the ionosphere in the form of microwaves has yet to be studied, but nothing has been suggested which might lead to any significant effect.

== Non-typical configurations and architectural considerations ==
The typical reference system-of-systems involves a significant number (several thousand multi-gigawatt systems to service all or a significant portion of Earth's energy requirements) of individual satellites in GEO.  The typical reference design for the individual satellite is in the 1-10 GW range and usually involves planar or concentrated solar photovoltaics (PV) as the energy collector / conversion.  The most typical transmission designs are in the 1–10&amp;nbsp;GHz (2.45 or 5.8&amp;nbsp;GHz) RF band where there are minimum losses in the atmosphere.  Materials for the satellites are sourced from, and manufactured on Earth and expected to be transported to LEO via re-usable rocket launch, and transported between LEO and GEO via chemical or electrical propulsion.  In summary, the architecture choices are: 
* '''Location = GEO'''
* '''Energy Collection = PV'''
* '''Satellite = Monolithic Structure'''
* '''Transmission = RF''' 
* '''Materials &amp; Manufacturing = Earth'''
*  '''Installation = RLVs to LEO, Chemical to GEO'''
There are several interesting design variants from the reference system:

'''Alternate energy collection location''':  While GEO is most typical because of its advantages of nearness to Earth, simplified pointing and tracking, very small time in occultation, and scalability to meet all global demand several times over, other locations have been proposed:
* '''Sun Earth L1:''' Robert Kennedy III, Ken Roy &amp; David Fields have proposed a variant of the L1 sunshade called "Dyson Dots"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.10.022 |title=Dyson Dots: Changing the solar constant to a variable with photovoltaic lightsails |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=82 |issue=2 |pages=225–37 |year=2013 |last1=Kennedy |first1=Robert G. |last2=Roy |first2=Kenneth I. |last3=Fields |first3=David E. |bibcode=2013AcAau..82..225K }}&lt;/ref&gt; where a multi-terawatt primary collector would beam energy back to a series of LEO sun-synchronous receiver satellites.  The much farther distance to Earth requires a correspondingly larger transmission aperture.
* '''Lunar Surface''': [[David Criswell]] has proposed using the Lunar surface itself as the collection medium, beaming power to the ground via a series of microwave reflectors in Earth Orbit.  The chief advantage of this approach would be the ability to manufacture the solar collectors in-situ without the energy cost and complexity of launch.  Disadvantages include the much longer distance, requiring larger transmission systems, the required "overbuild" to deal with the lunar night, and the difficulty of sufficient manufacturing and pointing of reflector satellites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lunarsolarpower.org/#!criswell/czxo&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''MEO:''' MEO systems have been proposed for in-space utilities and beam-power propulsion infrastructures.  For example, see Royce Jones' paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthspaceagency.org/images/stories/BeamedEnergyPublish.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610012509/http://www.earthspaceagency.org/images/stories/BeamedEnergyPublish.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Highly Elliptical Orbits:''' Molniya, Tundra, or Quazi Zenith orbits have been proposed as early locations for niche markets, requiring less energy to access and providing good persistence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sspi.gatech.edu/welsom_isdc_reed.pdf Kevin Reed's QGSO proposal (Slide 25)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sun-Sync LEO:''' In this near Polar Orbit, the satellites precess at a rate that allows them to always face the Sun as they rotate around Earth.  This is an easy to access orbit requiring far less energy, and its proximity to Earth requires smaller (and therefore less massive) transmitting apertures.  However disadvantages to this approach include having to constantly shift receiving stations, or storing energy for a burst transmission.  This orbit is already crowded and has significant space debris.
* '''Equatorial LEO:''' Japan's SPS 2000 proposed an early demonstrator in equatorial LEO in which multiple equatorial participating nations could receive some power.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spacefuture.com/power/sps2000.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Earth's Surface''': Narayan Komerath has proposed a space power grid where excess energy from an existing grid or power plant on one side of the planet can be passed up to orbit, across to another satellite and down to receivers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adl.gatech.edu/archives/adlp06100501.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Energy Collection:''' The most typical designs for Solar Power Satellites include photovoltaics.  These may be planar (and usually passively cooled), concentrated (and perhaps actively cooled).  However, there are multiple interesting variants. 
* '''Solar Thermal:''' Proponents of Solar Thermal have proposed using concentrated heating to cause a state change in a fluid to extract energy via rotating machinery followed by cooling in radiators.  Advantages of this method might include overall system mass (disputed), non-degradation due to solar-wind damage, and radiation tolerance. One recent thermal solar power satellite design by [[Keith Henson]] and others has been visualized here. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Lrj35HcbQ]  A related concept is here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEkZkINrJaA]  The proposed radiators are thin wall platic tube filled with low pressure (2.4 kPa) and temperature (20 deg C) steam.
* '''Solar Pumped Laser:''' Japan has pursued a solar-pumped laser, where sunlight directly excites the lasing medium used to create the coherent beam to Earth.
* '''Fusion Decay:''' This version of a power-satellite is not "solar".  Rather, the vacuum of space is seen as a "feature not a bug" for traditional fusion.  Per Paul Werbos, after fusion even neutral particles decay to charged particles which in a sufficiently large volume would allow direct conversion to current.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}
* '''[[Dyson–Harrop satellite|Solar Wind Loop]]:''' Also called a [[Dyson–Harrop satellite]]. Here the satellite makes use not of the photons from the Sun but rather the charged particles in the solar wind which via electro-magnetic coupling generate a current in a large loop.
* '''Direct Mirrors:''' Early concepts for direct mirror re-direction of light to planet Earth suffered from the problem that rays coming from the sun are not parallel but are expanding from a disk and so the size of the spot on the Earth is quite large. Lewis Fraas has explored an array of parabolic mirrors to augment existing solar arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtu.edu/ece/department/faculty/full-time/zekavat/SSP2015_fraas.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701131409/http://www.mtu.edu/ece/department/faculty/full-time/zekavat/SSP2015_fraas.pdf |archivedate=2016-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Alternate Satellite Architecture:''' The typical satellite is a monolithic structure composed of a structural truss, one or more collectors, one or more transmitters, and occasionally primary and secondary reflectors. The entire structure may be gravity gradient stabilized.  Alternative designs include:
* '''Swarms of Smaller Satellites''': Some designs propose swarms of free-flying smaller satellites.  This is the case with several laser designs, and appears to be the case with CALTECH's Flying Carpets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2426/ |title = Will orbiting flying carpets light the world?}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For RF designs, an engineering constraint is the [[Sparse arrray curse|sparse array]] problem.
* '''Free Floating Components''': [[Solaren]] has proposed an alternative to the monolithic structure where the primary reflector and transmission reflector are free-flying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bldgblog.com/2009/04/space-based-storm-control/ |title = Space-Based Storm Control|date = 17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Spin Stabilization:''' NASA explored a spin-stabilized thin film concept.
* '''Photonic Laser Thruster (PLT) stabilized structure:''' Young Bae has proposed that photon pressure may substitute for compressive members in large structures.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}
'''Transmission:''' The most typical design for energy transmission is via an RF antenna at below 10&amp;nbsp;GHz to a rectenna on the ground. Controversy exists between the benefits of Klystrons, Gyrotrons, Magnetrons and solid state.  Alternate transmission approaches include:
* '''Laser:''' Lasers offer the advantage of much lower cost and mass to first power, however there is controversy regarding benefits of efficiency.  Lasers allow for much smaller transmitting and receiving apertures.  However, a highly concentrated beam has eye-safety, fire safety, and weaponization concerns.  Proponents believe they have answers to all these concerns.  A laser-based approach must also find alternate ways of coping with clouds and precipitation.
* '''Atmospheric Waveguide:''' Some have proposed it may be possible to use a short pulse laser to create an atmospheric waveguide through which concentrated microwaves could flow.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA500916&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://physics.aps.org/articles/v7/21 |title = A Waveguide Made of Hot Air|journal = Physics|date = 26 February 2014|volume = 7|last1 = Tzortzakis|first1 = Stelios|last2 = Couairon|first2 = Arnaud|pages = 21|doi = 10.1103/Physics.7.21|bibcode = 2014PhyOJ...7...21C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://phys.technion.ac.il/index.php/en/events/details/1307-long-lived-atmospheric-waveguide-in-the-wake-of-laser-filaments|title=Events - "Long-lived Atmospheric Waveguide in the Wake of Laser Filaments"|website=phys.technion.ac.il|access-date=2016-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Nuclear synthesis:''' [[Particle accelerators]] based in the inner solar system (whether in orbit or on a planet such as [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]) could use solar energy to synthesize nuclear fuel from naturally-occurring materials. While this would be highly inefficient using current technology (in terms of the amount of energy needed to manufacture the fuel compared to the amount of energy contained in the fuel) and would raise obvious [[nuclear safety]] issues, the basic technology upon which such an approach would rely on has been in use for decades, making this possibly the most reliable means of sending energy especially over very long distances - in particular, from the inner solar system to the outer solar system.
'''Materials and Manufacturing:''' Typical designs make use of the developed industrial manufacturing system extant on Earth, and use Earth based materials both for the satellite and propellant.  Variants include:
* '''Lunar Materials:''' Designs exist for Solar Power Satellites that source &gt;99% of materials from lunar regolith with very small inputs of "vitamins" from other locations.  Using materials from the Moon is attractive because launch from the Moon is in theory far less complicated than from Earth.  There is no atmosphere, and so components do not need to be packed tightly in an aeroshell and survive vibration, pressure and temperature loads. Launch may be via a magnetic mass driver and the requirement to use propellant for launch entirely.  Launch from the Moon the GEO also requires far less energy than from Earth's much deeper gravity well.  Building all the solar power satellites to fully supply all the required energy for the entire planet requires less than one millionth of the mass of the Moon.
* '''Self-Replication on the Moon:''' NASA explored a self-replicating factory on the Moon in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nss.org/settlement/moon/library/1982-SelfReplicatingLunarFactory.pdf{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, Justin Lewis-Webber proposed a method of speciated manufacture of core elements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/space.2015.0041 |title=Lunar-Based Self-Replicating Solar Factory |journal=New Space |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=53–62 |year=2016 |last1=Lewis-Weber |first1=Justin |bibcode=2016NewSp...4...53L }}&lt;/ref&gt; based upon John Mankins SPS-Alpha design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.artemisinnovation.com/aboutus.html |title = ARTEMIS Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/716070main_Mankins_2011_PhI_SPS_Alpha.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Asteroidal Materials:''' Some asteroids are thought to have even lower Delta-V to recover materials than the Moon, and some particular materials of interest such as metals may be more concentrated or easier to access.
* '''In-Space/In-Situ Manufacturing:''' With the advent of in-space additive manufacturing, concepts such as SpiderFab might allow mass launch of raw materials for local extrusion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tethers.com/SpiderFab.html{{full citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Method of Installation / Transportation of Material to Energy Collection Location''': In the reference designs, component material is launched via well-understood chemical rockets (usually fully reusable launch systems) to LEO, after which either chemical or electrical propulsion is used to carry them to GEO.  The desired characteristics for this system is very high mass-flow at low total cost. Alternate concepts include:
* '''Lunar Chemical Launch''': ULA has recently showcased a concept for a fully re-usable chemical lander XEUS to move materials from the Lunar surface to LLO or GEO.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ulalaunch.com/uploads/docs/Published_Papers/Commercial_Space/SSP_12_15_sowers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Lunar [[Mass driver|Mass Driver]]:''' Launch of materials from the lunar surface using a system similar to an aircraft carrier electromagnetic catapult.  An unexplored compact alternative would be the slingatron.
* '''[[Lunar space elevator|Lunar Space Elevator]]:''' An equatorial or near-equatorial cable extends to and through the lagrange point.  This is claimed by proponents to be lower in mass than a traditional mass driver.
* '''[[Space elevator|Space Elevator]]''': A ribbon of pure carbon nanotubes extends from its center of gravity in Geostationary orbit, allowing climbers to climb up to GEO.  Problems with this include the material challenge of creating a ribbon of such length with adequate strength, management of collisions with satellites and space debris, and lightning.
* '''MEO Skyhook:''' As part of an AFRL study, Roger Lenard proposed a MEO Skyhook.  It appears that a gravity gradient-stabilized tether with its center of mass in MEO can be constructed of available materials.  The bottom of the skyhook is close to the atmosphere in a "non-keplerian orbit".  A re-usable rocket can launch to match altitude and speed with the bottom of the tether which is in a non-keplerian orbit (travelling much slower than typical orbital speed).  The payload is transferred and it climbs the cable.  The cable itself is kept from de-orbiting via electric propulsion and/or electromagnetic effects.
* '''[[Maglev|MAGLEV]] Launch / [[StarTram]]:''' John Powell has a concept for a very high mass-flow system.  In a first-gen system, built into a mountain, accelerates a payload through an evacuated MAGLEV track.  A small on-board rocket circulizes the payload.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.startram.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Beamed Energy Launch:''' [[Kevin L.G. Parkin|Kevin Parkin]] and [[Escape Dynamics]] both have concepts&lt;ref&gt;https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/2405/&lt;/ref&gt; for ground-based irradiation of a mono-propellant launch vehicle using RF energy.  The RF energy is absorbed and directly heats the propellant not unlike in NERVA-style nuclear-thermal.  LaserMotive has a concept for a laser-based approach.

== In fiction ==

Space stations transmitting solar power have appeared in science-fiction works like [[Isaac Asimov]]'s "[[Reason (short story)|Reason]]" (1941), that centers around the troubles caused by [[Robot series (Asimov)|the robots]] operating the station. Asimov's short story "[[The Last Question]]" also features the use of SBSP to provide limitless energy for use on Earth.

In [[Ben Bova]]'s novel ''PowerSat'' (2005), an entrepreneur strives to prove that his company's nearly completed power satellite and [[spaceplane]] (a means of getting maintenance crews to the satellite efficiently) are both safe and economically viable, while terrorists with ties to oil producing nations attempt to derail these attempts through subterfuge and sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |isbn = 0765348179|title = Powersat|last1 = Bova|first1 = Ben|date = 2006-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various aerospace companies have also showcased imaginative future solar power satellites in their corporate vision videos, including Boeing,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEjPLHmFAM8 You Just Wait&lt;/ref&gt; Lockheed Martin,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQxfJzl2jkg The Next 100 Years&lt;/ref&gt; and United Launch Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxftPmpt7aA CIS-Lunar 1000&lt;/ref&gt;

The Solar Satellite is one of three means of producing energy in the browser-based game [[OGame]].
