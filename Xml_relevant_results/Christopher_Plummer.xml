==Stage career==

====Broadway====
[[File:Christopher Plummer.jpg|225px|thumb|right|upright|Photograph by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1959]]
Plummer made his Broadway debut in January 1953 in ''The Starcross Story'', a show that closed on opening night. His next Broadway appearance, ''Home is the Hero'', lasted 30 performances from September to October 1954. He appeared in support of Broadway legend [[Katharine Cornell]] and film legend [[Tyrone Power]] in ''[[The Dark Is Light Enough]]'', which lasted 69 performances from February to April 1955. The play toured several cities, with Plummer serving as Power's understudy.&lt;ref name="spite"/&gt; Later that same year, he appeared in his first Broadway hit, opposite [[Julie Harris (actress)|Julie Harris]] (who won a Tony Award) in [[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''[[The Lark (play)|The Lark]]''. After appearing in ''[[Night of the Auk]]'', which was not a success, Plummer appeared in [[Elia Kazan]]'s successful Broadway production of [[Archibald MacLeish]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning play ''[[J.B. (play)|J.B.]]''; Plummer was nominated for his first Tony as Best Actor in Play. (''J.B.'' also won Tonys as Best Play and for Kazan's direction.)

Plummer appeared less frequently on Broadway in the 1960s as he moved from New York to London. He appeared in the title role in a 1963 production of [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui]]'', which did not succeed, but he had a great success in [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[The Royal Hunt of the Sun]]'', playing conquistador [[Francisco Pizarro]] to [[David Carradine]]'s [[Atahuallpa]]; both performances were "stunning," as Plummer did wonders "of extraordinary beauty and deep pain" in playing his complex character.&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell Titcomb (1965). "The Royal Hunt of the Sun." Harvard Crimson. November 9, 1965. Retrieved August 12, 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; (In the ''[[The Royal Hunt of the Sun (film)|1969 film adaptation]]'', Plummer would take the title role.) From May to June 1973, he appeared on Broadway as [[Cyrano de Bergerac|the title character]] in ''[[Cyrano (musical)|Cyrano]]'', a musical adaptation of [[Edmond Rostand]]'s 1897 play ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' by [[Anthony Burgess]] and Michael J. Lewis. For that performance, Plummer won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Actor in a Musical and a [[Drama Desk Award]] for Outstanding Performance. Later that year, he played [[Anton Chekhov]] in [[Neil Simon]]'s adaptation of several Chekhov short stories, ''[[The Good Doctor (play)|The Good Doctor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.theatermirror.com/TAgooddr2ND.htm| title=Theatre Mirror Reviews: "The Good Doctor"| journal=Theater Mirror| accessdate=November 29, 2016| first=Tony| last=Annicone| date=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, he appeared on Broadway in two Shakespearean tragedies, ''[[Othello]]'', playing Iago to [[James Earl Jones]]' Moor, and the title role in ''[[Macbeth]]'' with [[Glenda Jackson]] playing his [[Lady Macbeth|lady]]. His Iago brought him another Tony nomination. He appeared with [[Jason Robards]] in the 1994 revival of [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[No Man's Land (play)|No Man's Land]]'' and had great success in 1997 in ''[[Barrymore (play)|Barrymore]]'', which he also toured with after a successful Broadway run. His turn as [[John Barrymore]] brought him his second Tony Award (this time as Best Actor in Play) and a [[Drama Desk Award]] as Outstanding Actor in a Play. He was nominated for a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award for his 2004 ''[[King Lear]]'' and for a Tony playing Henry Drummond in the 2007 revival of ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.playbill.com/person/christopher-plummer-vault-0000073985| title=Christopher Plummer| journal=[[Playbill]]| accessdate=November 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stratford Festival====
Plummer made his debut at the [[Stratford Shakespeare Festival]] in 1956, playing the title role in ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', which subsequently was performed that year at the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. He played the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]'' and Sir Andrew Aguecheek in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' at Stratford in 1957. The following year, he played Leontes in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', Bardolph in ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', and Benedick in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''. In 1960, he played Philip the Bastard in ''[[King John (play)|King John]]'' and Mercutio in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. In 1962, he played the title roles in both ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Macbeth]]'', returning in 1967 to play Mark Antony in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''.&lt;ref name="the-sound-of-music-guide1"&gt;{{cite web| title=Actor Christopher Plummer On Stage| url=http://www.the-sound-of-music-guide.com/actor-christopher-plummer.html| publisher=The Sound of Music Guide| accessdate=July 25, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909071146/http://www.the-sound-of-music-guide.com/actor-christopher-plummer.html| archive-date=September 9, 2011| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://archives.stratfordfestival.ca/AIS/Details/people/8943 | title = Christopher Plummer acting credits | website = Stratford Festival Archives | access-date = June 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plummer returned to the Stratford Festival in the summer of 2010 in ''[[The Tempest]]'' as the lead character, [[Prospero]] (also videotaped and shown in high-def in cinemas), and again in the summer of 2012 in the one-man show, ''A Word or Two'', an autobiographical exploration of his love of literature. In 2014, Plummer presented ''A Word or Two'' again, at the [[Ahmanson Theatre]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McNulty| first=Charles| title=Review: Christopher Plummer, a man of letters, says 'A Word or Two'| url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-a-word-or-two-review-20140124,0,3758435.story| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date=January 23, 2014| accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made his London debut on June 11, 1961, playing King Henry II in [[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''[[Becket]]'' with the RSC at the Aldwych Theatre, directed by [[Peter Hall (director)|Peter Hall]].

His next film, the Oscar-winning ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', made cinematic history, becoming the all-time top-grossing film, eclipsing ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Goldsmith| first=Patrick| title=Is this a box-office record with an * ?| url=https://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/30/entertainment/la-et-bigpicture30-2010jan30| newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date=January 30, 2010| accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was in ''[[Inside Daisy Clover]]'' (1965), then played World War Two agent [[Eddie Chapman]] in ''[[Triple Cross (1966 film)|Triple Cross]]'' (1966) and had a support role as [[Erwin Rommel|Field Marshal Erwin Rommel]] in ''[[The Night of the Generals]]'' (1967). Plummer was cast to replace [[Rex Harrison]] for the film adaptation of ''[[Doctor Dolittle (film)|Doctor Dolittle]]''. This decision was later reversed, but Plummer was nonetheless paid $87,500 for signing the contract. At the same time, Plummer was performing in the stage play ''[[The Royal Hunt of the Sun]]'' and his whole ''Dolittle'' participation was so brief that Plummer never missed a performance.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;{{cite book| last=Harris| first=Mark| title=Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood| url=https://books.google.com/?id=EwSv6lsPDxgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=plummer| date=February 14, 2008| publisher=[[Penguin Group|The Penguin Press]]| page=154| isbn=978-1594201523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Sound of Music''====

[[File:The Sound of Music Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Plummer and [[Julie Andrews]] on the set for ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' in [[Salzburg]], 1964]]

Plummer remains widely known for his portrayal of [[Georg von Trapp|Captain Von Trapp]] due to the box office success and continued popularity of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965), a role which he once described as "so awful and sentimental and gooey".&lt;ref name="bbc20111205"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16031054| title=Christopher Plummer slates 'gooey' Sound of Music role| work=[[BBC News]]| date=December 5, 2011| accessdate=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found all aspects of making the film unpleasant, except working with Andrews, and he avoids using its name, instead calling it "that movie", "S&amp;M", or "The Sound of Mucus".&lt;ref name="abel20100131"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.boston.com/ae/movies/articles/2010/01/31/at_80_christopher_plummer_lands_roles_that_are_his_cup_of_tea/?page=all| title=At 80, Plummer has arrived at his 'Station'| newspaper=The Boston Globe| date=January 31, 2010| accessdate=September 18, 2013| last=Abel| first=Judy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He declined to attend the 40th Anniversary cast reunion, but he did provide commentary on the 2005 DVD release. He relented for the 45th anniversary and appeared with the full cast on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' on October 28, 2010.

In 2009, Plummer said that he was "a bit bored with the character" of Captain von Trapp. "Although we worked hard enough to make him interesting, it was a bit like flogging a dead horse. And the subject matter is not mine. I mean, it can't appeal to every person in the world."&lt;ref name="Plummer"/&gt; However, he admits that the film itself was well made and is proud to be associated with a film with such mass appeal. "But it was a very well-made movie, and it's a family movie and we haven't seen a family movie, I don't think, on that scale for ages."&lt;ref name="horizons"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/features/1525/christopher-plummer-for-the-last-station| title=Christopher Plummer for "The Last Station| first=Paul| last=Fischer| publisher=Dark Horizons| date=December 29, 2009| accessdate=July 25, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809161356/http://www.darkhorizons.com/features/1525/christopher-plummer-for-the-last-station| archive-date=August 9, 2012| url-status=dead| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Academy Award nominations====
In January 2010, Plummer received his first [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for his portrayal of author [[Leo Tolstoy]] in ''[[The Last Station]]'' (2009).&lt;ref name="USAtoday"&gt;{{cite news| title=Christopher Plummer, 80, revels in first Oscar nomination| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2010/02/christopher-plummer-80-revels-in-first-oscar-nomination/1| first=Ann| last=Oldenburg| newspaper=[[USA Today]]| date=February 2, 2010| accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking to the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] in an interview that aired on March 7, 2010,&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/video/#/News/Arts_and_Entertainment/1244504193/ID=1445422951| title=Christopher Plummer interview| date=March 8, 2010| work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plummer added, tongue-in-cheek, "Well, I said it's about time! I mean, I'm 80 years old, for God's sake. Have mercy." On Oscar night, March 7, 2010, however, he lost to [[Christoph Waltz]].&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news| title=Christoph Waltz wins Oscar for "Basterds"| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/03/08/us-oscars-waltz-idUSTRE6270WW20100308| first=Alex| last=Dobuzinskis| date=March 7, 2010| agency=[[Reuters]]| website=reuters.com| accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plummer received his second nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his performance in ''[[Beginners]]'' (2011), and was announced as the winner at the [[84th Academy Awards]]. Plummer's win made him, at age 82, the oldest actor to win an Academy Award. When he accepted the award, he quipped "You're only two years older than me, darling. Where have you been all my life?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=883H6gNZyGM| title=Christopher Plummer winning Best Supporting Actor| website=YouTube| date=February 26, 2012| accessdate=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''All the Money in the World''====
{{main|All the Money in the World}}
In November 2017, Plummer, who was director [[Ridley Scott]]'s original choice to play [[J. Paul Getty]] in ''[[All the Money in the World]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christopher-plummer-replace-kevin-spacey-all-money-world-1056450| title=Christopher Plummer to Replace Kevin Spacey in 'All the Money in the World'| last1=Galuppo| first1=Mia| last2=McClintock| first2=Pamela| last3=Giardina| first3=Carolyn| newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]| date=November 9, 2017| accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was cast to replace [[Kevin Spacey]] in the then-already completed film. The move came amid numerous [[sexual harassment]] and [[sexual assault]] allegations made towards Spacey. All scenes that had included Spacey were re-shot with Plummer. Co-stars [[Mark Wahlberg]] and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] were part of the necessary filming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2017/11/09/movie-magician-christopher-plummer-seeks-to-perform-a-cinematic-miracle-by-replacing-kevin-spacey-howell.html| title=If any actor can quickly replace Kevin Spacey, it's Christopher Plummer: Howell| first=Peter| last=Howell| date=November 9, 2017| newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was made not long before the scheduled release date of December 22. [[TriStar Pictures]] intended to meet that release date in spite of the tight re-shooting and editing schedule; it was eventually pushed back to December 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1=Fleming Jr.| first1=Mike| title=Shocker: Kevin Spacey Dropped From 'All The Money In The World;' J Paul Getty Role Recast With Christopher Plummer| url=https://deadline.com/2017/11/kevin-spacey-dropped-all-in-the-money-in-the-world-christopher-plummer-ridley-scott-j-paul-getty-1202204437/| journal=[[Deadline Hollywood]]| accessdate=November 9, 2017| date=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/09/kevin-spacey-to-be-cut-out-of-all-the-money-in-the-world.html| title=Kevin Spacey to be cut out of 'All the Money in the World' following assault allegations| first=Andrea| last=Mandell| date=November 9, 2017| website=[[CNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his role, Plummer earned [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture|Golden Globe]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|BAFTA]] and Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor.

====Documentaries====
In 1963, he was the subject of a short [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentary, ''30 Minutes, Mister Plummer'', directed by [[Anne Claire Poirier]].&lt;ref name="poirier"&gt;{{cite video| title=30 Minutes, Mister Plummer| url=http://nfb.ca/film/30_minutes_mister_plummer| people=Anne Claire Poirier, director| website=[[National Film Board of Canada]]| accessdate=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Plummer had fallen ill, Shatner took the stage, earning his first big break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Exclusive Clips from William Shatner's ''The Captains''| url=http://trekmovie.com/2011/07/18/exclusive-clips-from-william-shatners-the-captains-how-to-watch-doc-for-free-online| date=July 18, 2011| website=Trekmovie.com| accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Plummer has been married three times. His first wife was the actress [[Tammy Grimes]], who he married in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Rainho| first1=Manny| title=This Month in Movie History| journal=Classic Images| date=August 2015| issue=482| pages=24‚Äì26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their marriage lasted four years, and they had a daughter together, the actress [[Amanda Plummer]] (born 1957). However, as he mentions in his autobiography, Plummer was unable to have much contact with his daughter during her early and teenage years, because her mother was adamant about blocking access. He and Amanda, who is his only child, did establish contact after she became an adult, and they now maintain a friendly relationship.

Plummer was next married to journalist Patricia Lewis from May 4, 1962, until their divorce in 1967. Three years after his second divorce, Plummer married actress [[Elaine Taylor (actress)|Elaine Taylor]] on October 2, 1970. Plummer and Elaine live in [[Weston, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news| first=Steve| last=Daly| title=Captain, Our Captain| url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1128481,00.htm| journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| date=November 11, 2005| accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weston2017"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://westport.dailyvoice.com/news/westons-christopher-plummer-reshoots-kevin-spaceys-role-in-getty-movie/726602/| title=Weston's Christopher Plummer Reshoots Kevin Spacey's Role In Getty Movie| newspaper=Weston Daily Voice| date=November 12, 2017| accessdate=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plummer has no children by either his second or third marriages.
