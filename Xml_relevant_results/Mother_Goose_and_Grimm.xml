'''''Mother Goose and Grimm''''' (a.k.a. '''''Mother Goose &amp; Grimm''''') is an internationally syndicated [[comic strip]] by [[cartoonist]] [[Mike Peters (cartoonist)|Mike Peters]] of the ''[[Dayton Daily News]]''.  It was first syndicated starting October 1, 1984, and is distributed by [[King Features Syndicate]] to 500 newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holtz |first1=Allan |title=American Newspaper Comics: An Encyclopedic Reference Guide |date=2012 |publisher=The University of Michigan Press |location=Ann Arbor |isbn=9780472117567 |page=278}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peters received the [[National Cartoonists Society]]'s 1991 [[Reuben Award]] for the strip as well as a nomination for its Newspaper Comic Strip Award for 2000.

==Characters and story==
The strip revolves around a yellow [[Bull Terrier]] named Grimm, owned by an anthropomorphic goose named Mother Goose, along with a dimwitted [[Boston Terrier]] named Ralph and a [[cat]] named Attila. The strip is noted for its references to popular culture or recent news that are often spoofed and referenced for a certain period of time often depending on the length of the hype devoted to a certain news story or topic, e.g. Grimm's creation of a website known as "GrimmyLeaks", which was devoted to publishing rumors relating to fellow comic strip characters, in reference to the controversy surrounding the scandalous website [[WikiLeaks]]. The comic strip also makes multiple references to iconic fictional characters including [[Mr. Potato Head]], [[Superman]], [[Batman]], and more, along with popular products including Amazon Kindles.

The strip also often consists of stand-alone one-panel comics that do not relate to the continuing story or characters.

The comic strip is also named after the [[nursery rhyme]] collection, [[Mother Goose]] and the [[fairytale]] collection, [[Brothers Grimm]].

==Television show==
[[CBS]] premiered a [[Saturday morning cartoon]] in 1991, ''[[Mother Goose and Grimm (TV series)|Mother Goose and Grimm]]'', which was renamed to ''Grimmy'' in its second and final season. The voice performers included [[Charlie Brill]] as Grimmy, [[Mitzi McCall]] as Mother Goose, and [[Greg Burson]] as Attila. The show is often shown in syndication.

==Cameo appearances==
Grimmy made a couple of appearances on the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] [[animated film]], ''[[Garfield Gets Real]]''. His first appearance was in the cafeteria scene, when Odie jumps on the table that Grimmy's sitting at. His second one was when he was drinking out of the water fountain near the auditorium, in which he sees a [[poodle]] and immediately falls in love, drops the water on his head and follows the poodle. He later appeared again in another cafeteria scene in which everyone is thinking of an idea in which to bring Garfield and Odie to come back to Cartoonworld. He appeared again in the men's bathroom drinking out of the toilet, and is immediately embarrassed. This was similar to Dagwood's scene in which he is taking a bath. His final appearance was when everybody is cheering that they had brought back Garfield from the real world, in which he is in a crowd cheering. He did not appear in the sequels, ''[[Garfield's Fun Fest]]'' and ''[[Garfield's Pet Force]]''. Grimmy also made an appearance as a pair of slippers in the ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'' segment, ''The Name Game'', with his ears excluded.
