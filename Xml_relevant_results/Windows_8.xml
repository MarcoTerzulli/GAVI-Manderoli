{{Windows 8}}
'''Windows 8''' is&lt;!--Do NOT change to "was". This violates [[MOS:TENSE]], which specifies that all articles on operating systems are written in present tense, even if discontinued.--&gt; an [[operating system]] and the successor to ''[[Windows 7]]'' (2009), that was produced by [[Microsoft]] and being released as part of the [[Windows NT]] family of operating systems. The product was [[Software release life cycle#Release to manufacturing (RTM)|released to manufacturing]] on August 1, 2012, and [[general availability release|generally to retail]] on October 26, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zdnet.com/windows-8s-delivery-date-october-26-7000001158/|title=Windows 8's delivery date: October 26 |work=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=July 18, 2012|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows 8 introduced major changes to the operating system's platform and [[graphical user interface|user interface]] to improve its user experience on [[tablet computer|tablets]], where [[Microsoft_Windows|Windows]] was now competing with [[mobile operating system]]s, including [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]].&lt;ref name=asd-win8ad/&gt; In particular, these changes included a touch-optimized [[Windows shell]] based on Microsoft's [[Metro (design language)|"Metro"]] [[design language]], the [[Start menu#Third version|Start screen]] (which displays programs and dynamically updated content on a grid of tiles), a new platform for developing "[[Mobile app|apps]]" with an emphasis on [[touchscreen]] input, integration with online services (including the ability to synchronize apps and settings between devices), and [[Windows Store]], an [[Digital_distribution|online distribution]] for downloading and purchasing new [[software]]. Windows 8 added support for [[USB 3.0]], [[Advanced Format]] hard drives, [[near field communication]]s, and [[cloud computing]]. Additional security features were introduced, such as built-in [[antivirus software]], integration with [[Microsoft SmartScreen]] [[Anti-phishing software|phishing filtering]] service and support for [[UEFI Secure Boot]] on supported devices with [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface|UEFI firmware]], to prevent [[malware]] from infecting the boot process.

Windows 8 was released to a mixed critical reception. Although reaction towards its performance improvements, security enhancements, and improved support for touchscreen devices was positive, the new user interface of the operating system was widely criticized for being potentially confusing and difficult to learn, especially when used with a keyboard and mouse instead of a touchscreen. Despite these shortcomings, 60 million Windows 8 licenses were sold through January 2013, a number that included both upgrades and sales to [[OEM]]s for new PCs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foley |first=Mary Jo |url=http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-60-million-windows-8-licenses-sold-to-date-7000009549/ |title=Microsoft: 60 million Windows 8 licenses sold to date |work=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=January 8, 2013 |accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft released [[Windows 8.1]] in October 2013, addressing some aspects of Windows 8 that were criticized by reviewers and [[early adopter]]s and incorporated additional improvements to various aspects of the operating system.&lt;ref name="FT_7-5-13"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/330c8b8e-b66b-11e2-93ba-00144feabdc0.html|title=Microsoft prepares rethink on Windows 8 flagship software |first=Richard |last=Waters |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=May 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verge-81handson"/&gt; Windows 8 was ultimately succeeded by [[Windows 10]] in July 2015. Microsoft stopped providing support and updates for Windows 8 RTM since January 12, 2016, and Windows 8.1 must be installed to maintain support and receive further updates per Microsoft lifecycle policies regarding [[service pack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/lifecycle-windows81-faq?wa=wsignin1.0|title=Windows 8.1 Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ|last=|first=|date=|website=support.microsoft.com|publisher=|access-date=October 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for IE10 on [[Windows Server 2012]]&lt;ref name=cw-ie11support&gt;{{Cite web|title=Nearly 370M IE users have just 6 weeks to upgrade|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3010555/web-browsers/nearly-370m-ie-users-have-just-6-weeks-to-upgrade.html|website=Computerworld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beginning January 12, 2016, only the most current version of Internet Explorer available for a operating system will receive technical support and security updates|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/microsoft-internet-explorer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Windows Embedded 8 Standard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet Explorer Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ|url=https://support2.microsoft.com/gp/microsoft-internet-explorer/en-us|work=Microsoft Lifecycle Support Website|accessdate=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ended on January 31, 2020.

In August 2019, computer experts reported that the [[BlueKeep]] [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-0708}}, that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program's [[Remote Desktop Protocol]], allowing for the possibility of [[remote code execution]], may now include related flaws, collectively named ''[[DejaBlue]]'', affecting newer Windows versions (i.e., [[Windows 7]] and all recent versions).&lt;ref name="WRD-20190813"&gt;{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Andy |title=DejaBlue: New BlueKeep-Style Bugs Renew The Risk Of A Windows worm |url=https://www.wired.com/story/dejablue-windows-bugs-worm-rdp/ |date=August 13, 2019 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|wired]] |accessdate=November 8, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, experts reported a [[Microsoft]] [[security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-1162}}, based on [[legacy code]] involving [[Text Services Framework#ctfmon|Microsoft CTF and ctfmon (ctfmon.exe)]], that affects all [[Windows]] versions from the older [[Windows XP]] version to the most recent Windows 10 versions; a patch to correct the flaw is currently available.&lt;ref name="TP-20190814"&gt;{{cite news |last=Seals |first=Tara |title=20-Year-Old Bug in Legacy Microsoft Code Plagues All Windows Users |url=https://threatpost.com/20-year-old-bug-legacy-microsoft-windows-users/147336/ |date=August 14, 2019 |work=ThreatPost.com |accessdate=November 8, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development history==

===Early development===
Windows 8 development started before [[Windows 7]] had shipped in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Steven Sinofsky, Tami Reller, Julie Larson-Green, Antoine Leblond, and Michael Angiulo: Windows 8 Consumer Preview |work=News Center |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/exec/ssinofsky/2012/02-29Windows8.aspx |accessdate=April 27, 2012 |date=February 29, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206154805/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/exec/ssinofsky/2012/02-29Windows8.aspx |archive-date=February 6, 2013 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in January 2011, it was announced that the next version of Windows would add support for [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[system-on-chip]]s alongside the existing [[x86]] processors produced by vendors, especially [[AMD]] and [[Intel]]. Windows division president [[Steven Sinofsky]] demonstrated an early build of the port on prototype devices, while Microsoft CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] announced the company's goal for Windows to be "everywhere on every kind of device without compromise."&lt;ref name=engadget-armbuild&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft confirms ARM support is coming in Windows, will play nice with SoCs too|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/01/05/microsoft-confirms-arm-support-is-coming-in-windows-will-play-n/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zdnet-cesunveil&gt;{{cite web|title=CES: Windows to run on ARM chips, says Microsoft|url=http://www.zdnet.com/ces-windows-to-run-on-arm-chips-says-microsoft-3040091325/|work=[[ZDNet]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |url=https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2011/jan11/01-05SOCsupport.mspx |title=Microsoft Announces Support of System on a Chip Architectures From Intel, AMD, and ARM for Next Version of Windows |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=January 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407172917/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2011/jan11/01-05SOCsupport.mspx |archive-date=April 7, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Matt |last=Rosoff |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/01/05/businessinsider-microsoft-spills-beans-on--at-ces-2011-1.DTL |title=OK, So Windows 8 Is Coming To ARM Tablets...someday. (MSFT) |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |agency=Business Insider |publisher=Hearst Communications |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Details also began to surface about a new application framework for Windows 8 codenamed "Jupiter", which would be used to make "immersive" applications using [[XAML]] (similarly to [[Windows Phone]] and [[Silverlight]]) that could be distributed via a new packaging system and a rumored [[application store]].&lt;ref name=zdn-jupiter&gt;{{cite web|title=More on Microsoft 'Jupiter' and what it means for Windows 8|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/more-on-microsoft-jupiter-and-what-it-means-for-windows-8/8373|work=[[ZDNet]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[Pre-alpha|milestone releases]] of Windows 8 [[Internet leak|leaked]] to the general public. Milestone 1, Build 7850, was leaked on April 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/windows-8-build-7850-has-leaked|title=Windows 8 Build 7850 has leaked|date=April 12, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2012|first=Brad |last=Sams|work=[[Neowin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first build where the text of a window was written centered instead of aligned to the left. It was also probably the first appearance of the Metro-style font, and its wallpaper had the text ''shhh. let's not leak our hard work''. However, its detailed build number reveals that the build was created on September 22, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redmondpie.com/windows-8-build-7850-m1-leaked-download/|title=Windows 8 Build 7850 M1 Has Been Leaked|date=April 12, 2011|accessdate=December 28, 2012|work=Redmond Pie|first=Taimur |last=Asad}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaked copy was Enterprise edition. The OS still reads as "Windows 7". Milestone 2, Build 7955, was leaked on April 25, 2011. The traditional [[Blue Screen of Death]] (BSoD) was replaced by a new ''black'' screen, although this was later scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/windows-8-build-7955-sporting-new-black-screen-of-death/12529|title=Windows 8 build 7955 sporting new 'Black' Screen of Death|date=April 27, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2012|first=Adrian|last=Kingsley-Hughes|work=[[ZDNet]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This build introduced a new [[Ribbon (computing)|ribbon]] in Windows Explorer. Build 7959, with minor changes but the first 64-bit version was leaked on May 1, 2011. The "Windows 7" logo was temporarily replaced with text displaying "Microsoft Confidential". On June 17, 2011, build 7989 64-bit edition was leaked. It introduced a new boot screen featuring the same fish as the default Windows 7 Beta wallpaper, which was later scrapped, and the circling dots as featured in the final (although the final version comes with smaller circling dots throbber). It also had the text ''Welcome'' below them, although this was also scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winrumors.com/windows-8-milestone-3-build-7989-leaks/|title=Windows 8 Milestone 3 build 7989 leaks|date=April 27, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2012|first=Tom|last=Warren|work=Winrumors}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is worth mentioning that most of these leaks "hid" the main Metro UI features that were to come in tweak known as ''Red Lock'' in order to prevent relevant leaks. A patch named ''Red pill'' was necessary to reveal the new Metro UI as well as the redesigned Start Screen, Lock Screen and apps.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

On June 1, 2011, Microsoft unveiled Windows 8's new user interface, as well as additional features at both [[Computex Taipei]] and the [[All Things Digital|D9: All Things Digital]] conference in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Live from Microsoft's Windows 8 preview event at Computex 2011. |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/06/01/live-from-microsofts-windows-8-preview-event-at-computex-2011/|work=Engadget|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=June 1, 2011|accessdate=February 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press|title=Previewing 'Windows 8'|url=https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2011/jun11/06-01corporatenews.aspx|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=June 1, 2011|accessdate=February 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307150940/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2011/jun11/06-01corporatenews.aspx|archive-date=March 7, 2012|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 2012, Microsoft unveiled a new logo to be adopted for Windows 8.

[[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based [[Windows RT]] devices must have secure boot permanently enabled.&lt;ref name="building-secureboot"/&gt;&lt;ref name=warren /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired-sb"/&gt;

===Online services and functionality===
Windows 8 provides heavier integration with online services from Microsoft and others. A user can now log into Windows with a [[Microsoft account]], which can be used to access services and [[Synchronization|synchronize]] applications and settings between devices. Windows 8 also ships with a client app for Microsoft's [[SkyDrive]] [[cloud storage]] service, which also allows apps to save files directly to SkyDrive. A SkyDrive client for the desktop and [[File Explorer]] is not included in Windows 8, and must be downloaded separately.&lt;ref name=pcmag-win8skydrive&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 8 and the Cloud: SkyDrive|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2409155,00.asp|work=PC Magazine|publisher=Ziff Davis Media|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bundled multimedia apps are provided under the Xbox brand, including [[Xbox Music]], [[Xbox Video]], and the [[Xbox SmartGlass]] companion for use with an [[Xbox 360]] console. Games can integrate into an [[Xbox Live]] hub app, which also allows users to view their profile and [[gamerscore]].&lt;ref name=pcw-testdrivertm&gt;{{cite web|last=Case|first=Loyd|title=Test Driving Windows 8 RTM|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/260884/test_driving_windows_8_rtm.html|work=PC World|publisher=IDG|accessdate= September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other bundled apps provide the ability to link [[Flickr]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name=pl-windows8/&gt; Due to Facebook Connect service changes, Facebook support is disabled in all bundled apps effective June 8, 2015.&lt;ref name=ms-facebookremoved&gt;{{cite web|title=Facebook Connect is no longer available|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Facebook-Connect-is-no-longer-available-f31c8107-7b5a-4e3d-8a22-e506dacb6db6?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US|publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=June 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Internet Explorer 10]] is included as both a desktop program and a touch-optimized app, and includes increased support for [[HTML5]], [[CSS3]], and [[hardware acceleration]]. The Internet Explorer app does not support plugins or [[ActiveX]] components, but includes a version of [[Adobe Flash Player]] that is optimized for touch and low power usage. Initially, Adobe Flash would only work on sites included on a "Compatibility View" [[whitelist]]; however, after feedback from users and additional compatibility tests, an update in March 2013 changed this behavior to use a smaller [[blacklist]] of sites with known compatibility issues instead, allowing Flash to be used on most sites by default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2013/03/11/flash-in-windows-8.aspx |first=Rob |last=Mauceri |title=Flash in Windows 8 |work=IEBlog |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=March 11, 2013 |accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The desktop version does not contain these limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/05/31/windows-release-preview-the-sixth-ie10-platform-preview.aspx|first=Dean |last=Hachamovitch|title=Windows Release Preview: The Sixth IE10 Platform Preview|publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=May 31, 2012|accessdate=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows 8 also incorporates improved support for [[mobile broadband]]; the operating system can now detect the insertion of a [[Subscriber identity module|SIM card]] and automatically configure connection settings (including [[Access Point Name|APNs]] and carrier branding), and reduce its Internet usage in order to conserve bandwidth on [[Bandwidth cap|metered networks]]. Windows 8 also adds an integrated [[airplane mode]] setting to globally disable all wireless connectivity as well. Carriers can also offer account management systems through Windows Store apps, which can be automatically installed as a part of the connection process and offer usage statistics on their respective tile.&lt;ref name=bw8-broadband&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering Windows 8 for mobile networks|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/01/20/engineering-windows-8-for-mobility.aspx|work=Building Windows 8|publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows Store apps===

Windows 8 introduces a new style of application, ''[[Windows Store]] apps''. According to Microsoft developer Jensen Harris, these apps are to be optimized for [[touchscreen]] environments and are more specialized than current [[desktop application]]s. Apps can run either in a full-screen mode or be snapped to the side of a screen.&lt;ref name="pcw-building"/&gt; Apps can provide [[Toast (computing)|toast notifications]] on screen or animate their tiles on the Start screen with dynamic content. Apps can use "contracts"; a collection of [[Hooking|hooks]] to provide common functionality that can integrate with other apps, including search and sharing.&lt;ref name="pcw-building"/&gt; Apps can also provide integration with other services; for example, the People app can connect to a variety of different social networks and services (such as Facebook, [[Skype]], and [[People (Microsoft service)|People service]]), while the Photos app can aggregate photos from services such as Facebook and Flickr.&lt;ref name=pl-windows8&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 8 review|url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/review/5972/microsoft-windows-8-pro-desktop-tablet-os-review|publisher=Pocket Lint|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows Store apps run within a new set of [[Application programming interface|APIs]] known as [[Windows Runtime]], which supports [[programming language]]s such as [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Visual Basic .NET]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], along with [[HTML5]] and [[JavaScript]].&lt;ref name="pcw-building"/&gt; If written in some "high-level" languages, apps written for Windows Runtime can be compatible with both Intel and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] versions of Windows,&lt;ref name="bi-windows8"/&gt; otherwise they are not [[Binary code compatibility|binary code compatible]]. Components may be compiled as Windows Runtime Components, permitting consumption by all compatible languages.&lt;ref name=msdn-winrt-javascript&gt;{{cite web|title=Using the Windows Runtime in JavaScript|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh710230(v=vs.94).aspx|work=msdn|publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure stability and security, apps run within a [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxed environment]], and require permissions to access certain functionality, such as accessing the Internet or a camera.&lt;ref name=verge-talkswin8&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft talks Windows Store features, Metro app sandboxing for Windows 8 developers|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/5/17/3026590/microsoft-windows-8-developers-windows-store-sandboxing|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate= September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retail versions of Windows 8 are only able to install these apps through [[Windows Store]]&amp;nbsp;— a namesake distribution platform that offers both apps, and listings for desktop programs certified for comparability with Windows 8.&lt;ref name=bi-windows8&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosoff|first=Matt|title=Here's Everything You Wanted To Know About Microsoft's Upcoming iPad Killers|url=http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-02-09/tech/31040510_1_steven-sinofsky-pcs-microsoft-first|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|accessdate=February 10, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122030754/http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-02-09/tech/31040510_1_steven-sinofsky-pcs-microsoft-first|archivedate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-talkswin8/&gt; A method to [[Sideloading|sideload]] apps from outside Windows Store is available to devices running Windows 8 Enterprise and joined to a [[Windows domain|domain]]; Windows 8 Pro and [[Windows RT]] devices that are not part of a domain can also sideload apps, but only after special product keys are obtained through volume licensing.&lt;ref name=installapps&gt;{{cite web |title=How to Add and Remove Apps |url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh852635.aspx |work=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=May 31, 2012 |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |quote=To enable sideloading on a Windows 8 Enterprise computer that is not domain-joined or on any Windows® 8 Pro computer, you must use a sideloading product activation key.

The term "Immersive app" had been used internally by Microsoft developers to refer to the apps prior to the first official presentation of Windows 8, after which they were referred to as "Metro-style apps" in reference to the [[Metro (design language)|Metro design language]]. The term was phased out in August 2012; a Microsoft spokesperson denied rumors that the change was related to a potential trademark issue, and stated that "Metro" was only a codename that would be replaced prior to Windows 8's release.&lt;ref name=zdn-jupiter/&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-metrotm&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft advises developers to stop using 'Metro' name in apps following possible trademark dispute|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/2/3215039/microsoft-metro-name-dispute-developers|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate= August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these reports, the terms "Modern UI-style apps",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Microsoft now using 'Modern UI Style' to refer to Windows 8 'Metro Style' apps|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/10/3232921/microsoft-modern-ui-style-metro-style-replacement|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Windows 8-style apps"&lt;ref name=pcmag-metromess&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 8: The Metro Mess|url=http://forwardthinking.pcmag.com/none/301689-windows-8-the-metro-mess|work=PC Magazine|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Windows Store apps" began to be used by various Microsoft documents and material to refer to the new apps. In an interview on September 12, 2012, Soma Somasegar (vice president of Microsoft's development software division) confirmed that "Windows Store apps" would be the official term for the apps.&lt;ref name=zdnet-metroname&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft finally comes clean(er) on post-Metro naming plans|url=http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-finally-comes-cleaner-on-post-metro-naming-plans-7000004151/|work=ZDNet|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate= September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An MSDN page explaining the Metro design language uses the term "Modern design" to refer to the language as a whole.&lt;ref name=msdn-moderndesign&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern design|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh781237.aspx|work=MSDN|publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=December 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Web browsers====
Exceptions to the restrictions faced by Windows Store apps are given to [[web browsers]]. The user's default browser can distribute a Metro-style web browser in the same package as the desktop version, which has access to functionality unavailable to other apps, such as being able to permanently run in the background, use multiple background processes, and use [[Windows API]] code instead of WinRT (allowing for code to be re-used with the desktop version, while still taking advantage of features available to Windows Store apps, such as charms). Microsoft advertises this exception privilege "New experience enabled" (formerly "Metro-style enabled").

The developers of both [[Google Chrome|Chrome]] and [[Firefox]] committed to developing Metro-style versions of their browsers; while Chrome's "Windows 8 mode" (discontinued on Chrome version 49) uses a full-screen version of the existing desktop interface, Firefox's version (which was first made available on the "Aurora" release channel in September 2013) uses a touch-optimized interface inspired by the [[Firefox for mobile|Android version of Firefox]]. In October 2013, Chrome's app was changed to mimic the desktop environment used by [[Chrome OS]].&lt;ref name=winrt-browsers&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 8 browsers: the only Metro apps to get desktop power|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/windows-8-browsers-the-only-metro-apps-to-get-desktop-power-1073930|work=TechRadar|publisher=Future Publishing|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Jared|title=Google Chrome Gets Early Metro-Style App for Windows 8|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/257427/google_chrome_gets_early_metrostyle_app_for_windows_8.html|work=PCWorld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=firefox-metrow8&gt;{{cite web|title=Mozilla previews 'Metro'-ized Firefox for Windows 8|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9232137/Mozilla_previews_Metro_ized_Firefox_for_Windows_8|work=[[Computerworld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|accessdate=November 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing a new experience enabled desktop browser|url=http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=243079|publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=November 15, 2012|date=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=engadget-firefoxmetro&gt;{{cite web|title=Firefox for Windows 8 enters Aurora channel with touch and gesture support|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/09/21/firefox-for-windows-8-enters-aurora-channel/|work=Engadget|accessdate=September 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-metrochromeos&gt;{{cite web|title=Google is building Chrome OS straight into Windows 8|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/5/4806562/google-building-chrome-os-into-windows-8|work=The Verge|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of the Firefox app for Windows 8 has since been cancelled, citing a lack of user adoption for the beta versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nightingale|first=Johnathan|title=Update on Metro|url=https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2014/03/14/metro/|work=Firefox Future Releases Blog|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interface and desktop===
Windows 8 introduces significant changes to the operating system's user interface, many of which are aimed at improving its experience on [[tablet computer]]s and other [[touchscreen]] devices. The new user interface is based on Microsoft's [[Metro (design language)|Metro design language]] and uses a [[Start menu#Third version|Start screen]] similar to that of [[Windows Phone 7]] as the primary means of launching applications. The Start screen displays a customizable array of tiles linking to various apps and desktop programs, some of which can display constantly updated information and content through "live tiles".&lt;ref name="pcw-building"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Build: More Details On Building Windows 8 Metro Apps|url=http://forwardthinking.pcmag.com/show-reports/287736-build-more-details-on-building-windows-8-metro-apps|work=PC Magazine|accessdate=February 10, 2012|first=Michael|last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of [[Computer multitasking|multi-tasking]], apps can be snapped to the side of a screen.&lt;ref name="pcw-building"/&gt; Alongside the traditional [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]], a new simplified and touch-optimized settings app known as "PC Settings" is used for basic configuration and user settings. It does not include many of the advanced options still accessible from the normal Control Panel.&lt;ref name=verge-blueleak&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows Blue: a video preview of what's next for Windows 8|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/25/4144618/windows-blue-video-preview-screenshots|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A vertical [[toolbar]] known as [[Windows shell#The charms|the charms]]&lt;ref name="the-charms-msd" /&gt; (accessed by swiping from the right edge of a touchscreen, swiping from the right edge of a trackpad, or pointing the cursor at [[Screen hotspot|hotspots]] in the right corners of a screen) provides access to system and app-related functions, such as search, sharing, device management, settings, and a Start button.&lt;ref name="the-charms-msd"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charms: Search, share, start, devices, and settings|url=https://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-US/support/getting-started/using-the-charms?lc=1033|work=Microsoft Surface documentation|publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}{{dead link|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Otey|first=Michael|title=Top 10: Windows 8 Keyboard and Mouse Survival Guide|url=http://windowsitpro.com/windows-8/top-10-windows-8-keyboard-and-mouse-survival-guide-0|work=[[Windows IT Pro]]|publisher=[[Penton (company)|Penton]]|accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional [[desktop environment]] for running desktop applications is accessed via a tile on the Start screen.

==Removed features==
{{Main|List of features removed in Windows 8}}
Several notable features have been removed in Windows 8; support for playing [[DVD-Video]] was removed from [[Windows Media Player]] due to the cost of licensing the necessary decoders (especially for devices which do not include [[optical disc drive]]s at all) and the prevalence of online streaming services. For the same reasons, [[Windows Media Center]] is not included by default on Windows 8, but Windows Media Center and DVD playback support can be purchased in the "Pro Pack" (which upgrades the system to Windows 8 Pro) or "Media Center Pack" add-on for Windows 8 Pro. As with prior versions, third-party [[DVD player]] software can still be used to enable DVD playback.&lt;ref name=droppingDVD&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2403983,00.asp|title=Microsoft Dropping DVD Playback Support in Windows 8|first=Chloe |last=Albanesius|work=[[PC Magazine]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 4, 2012|accessdate= May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Backup and Restore]], the [[backup software|backup component]] of Windows, is [[deprecated]]. It still ships with Windows 8 and continues to work on preset schedules, but is pushed to the background and can only be accessed through a Control Panel applet called "Windows 7 File Recovery".&lt;ref name="cookbook" /&gt;{{Rp|76|date=November 2012}} [[Shadow Copy]], a component of [[Windows Explorer]] that once saved previous versions of changed files, no longer protects local files and folders.

The minimum system requirements for Windows 8 are slightly higher than [[Windows 7#Hardware requirements|those of Windows 7]]. The [[Central processing unit|CPU]] must support the [[Physical Address Extension]] (PAE), [[NX bit]], and [[SSE2]].

Microsoft's [[Connected Standby]] specification, which hardware vendors may optionally comply with, sets new power consumption requirements that extend above the above minimum specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/jj248729.aspx|title=Introduction to Connected Standby|date=September 28, 2012|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in this standard are a number of security-specific requirements designed to improve [[physical security]], notably against [[Cold Boot Attack]]s.

32-bit [[Stock keeping unit|SKUs]] of Windows 8 only support a maximum of 4 GB of RAM. 64-bit SKUs, however support more: Windows 8 x64 supports 128 GB while Windows 8 Pro and Enterprise x64 support 512 GB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366778%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#physical_memory_limits_windows_8 |title=Memory Limits for Windows and Windows Server Releases |work=[[MSDN]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |at=Physical Memory Limits: Windows 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, Microsoft announced that it would no longer support Windows 8.1 or 7 on devices using Intel's [[Skylake (microarchitecture)|Skylake]] CPU family effective July 17, 2018, and that all future CPU microarchitectures, as well as Skylake systems after this date, would only be supported on [[Windows 10]]. After the deadline, only critical security updates were to be released for users on these platforms.&lt;ref name=ars-skylake18months&gt;{{cite web|title=Skylake users given 18 months to upgrade to Windows 10|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/01/skylake-users-given-18-months-to-upgrade-to-windows-10/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zdnet-newsupportpolicy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bott|first1=Ed|title=Microsoft updates support policy: New CPUs will require Windows 10|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-updates-support-policy-new-cpus-will-require-windows-10/|website=[[ZDNet]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars-oemskylake"&gt;{{cite web|title=Skylake support on Windows 7 and 8.1 given a one-year extension|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/03/skylake-support-on-windows-7-and-8-1-given-a-one-year-extension/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cw-skylakechange"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft backtracks on Windows 7 support deadline|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3046032/windows-pcs/microsoft-backtracks-on-windows-7-support-deadline.html|website=[[Computerworld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this new policy faced criticism from users and enterprise customers, Microsoft partially retracted the change and stated that both operating systems would remain supported on Skylake hardware through the end of their Extended support lifecycle. Windows 8.1 remains officially unsupported on all newer CPU families, and neither AMD or Intel will provide official chipset [[device driver|drivers]] for Windows operating systems other than Windows 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMD: Sorry, there will be no official Ryzen drivers for Windows 7|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3167279/computers/amd-sorry-there-will-be-no-official-ryzen-drivers-for-windows-7.html|website=PC World|publisher=IDG|accessdate=April 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zdnet.com"/&gt; However, on August 2016, Microsoft again extended the Skylake support policy until the end of support for Windows 7 and 8.1 (2020 and 2023, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larsen|first1=Shad|title=Updates to Silicon Support Policy for Windows|url=https://blogs.windows.com/business/2016/08/11/updates-to-silicon-support-policy-for-windows/#takHPJavZfA9UMEA.97|website=Windows|accessdate=May 9, 2017|language=en|date=August 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zdnet.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jo Foley|first1=Mary|title=Microsoft extends again support for Windows 7, 8.1 Skylake-based devices|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-extends-again-support-for-windows-7-8-1-skylake-based-devices/|accessdate=May 9, 2017|date=August 11, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tablets and convertibles===
Microsoft released minimum hardware requirements for tablet and [[laplet]] devices to be "certified" for Windows 8 and defined a convertible form factor as a standalone device that combines the PC, display, and rechargeable power source with a mechanically attached keyboard and pointing device in a single chassis. A convertible can be transformed into a tablet where the attached input devices are hidden or removed leaving the display as the only input mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crothers |first=Brooke |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-57360734-64/microsoft-lays-out-window-8-tablet-hardware-requirements/ |title=Microsoft lays out Window 8 tablet hardware requirements &amp;#124; Nanotech—The Circuits Blog—CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=January 17, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newman |first=Jared |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/248279/windows_8_tablet_requirements_revealed.html |title=Windows 8 Tablet Requirements Revealed |publisher=PCWorld |date=January 27, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 2013, Microsoft amended its certification requirements to only require that screens on tablets have a minimum resolution of 1024×768 (down from the previous 1366×768). The amended requirement is intended to allow "greater design flexibility" for future products.&lt;ref name=zdnet-smallertab&gt;{{cite web|title=New Windows 8 hardware specs hint at 7-inch tablets and a Microsoft Reader|url=http://www.zdnet.com/new-windows-8-hardware-specs-hint-at-7-inch-tablets-and-a-microsoft-reader-7000013271/|publisher=ZDNet|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Updated certification requirements were implemented to coincide with Windows 8.1. As of 2014, all certified devices with integrated displays must contain a 720p webcam and higher quality speakers and microphones, while all certified devices that support Wi-Fi must support Bluetooth as well. As of 2015, all certified devices must contain [[Trusted Platform Module|Trusted Platform Module 2.0]] chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Nicole|title=Microsoft sets new hardware certification requirements for Windows 8.1|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/07/12/microsoft-new-hardware-certification-requirements-for-windows8.1/|work=[[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|accessdate=July 12, 2013|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zdnet-cert1415&gt;{{cite web|title=New Bluetooth, audio, TPM requirements coming for Windows 8 devices|url=http://www.zdnet.com/new-bluetooth-audio-tpm-requirements-coming-for-windows-8-devices-7000018003/|work=ZDNet|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
{{Main|Windows 8 editions}}
Windows 8 is available in three different editions, of which the lowest version, branded simply as ''Windows 8'', and ''Windows 8 Pro'', were sold at retail in most countries, and as pre-loaded software on new computers. Each edition of Windows 8 includes all of the capabilities and features of the edition below it, and add additional features oriented towards their market segments. For example, ''Pro'' added [[BitLocker]], [[Hyper-V]], the ability to join a [[Windows domain|domain]], and the ability to install [[Windows Media Center]] as a paid add-on. Users of ''Windows 8'' can purchase a "Pro Pack" license that upgrades their system to ''Windows 8 Pro'' through [[Windows Anytime Upgrade|Add features to Windows]]. This license also includes Windows Media Center.&lt;ref name="microsoftrevealsprice"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/windows/microsoft_news/240003119 | title=Microsoft Reveals Windows 8 Upgrade Price | publisher=InformationWeek | date=July 3, 2012 | accessdate=July 4, 2012 |first=Paul |last=McDougall}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://winsupersite.com/article/windows8/windows-8-secrets-book-guide-product-editions-144067 |title=Windows 8 Secrets, Beyond the Book: Guide to Product Editions |work=Supersite for Windows|publisher=Penton|accessdate=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blogging Windows "&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2012/04/16/announcing-the-windows-8-editions/ |title=Announcing the Windows 8 Editions |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=April 16, 2012 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Windows 8 Enterprise'' contains additional features aimed towards business environments, and is only available through [[volume licensing]].&lt;ref name="Blogging Windows"/&gt; A port of Windows 8 for [[ARM architecture]], [[Windows RT]], is marketed as an edition of Windows 8, but was only included as pre-loaded software on devices specifically developed for it.&lt;ref name="Blogging Windows "/&gt;

Windows 8 was distributed as a retail box product on [[DVD]], and through a [[digital distribution|digital download]] that could be converted into DVD or [[USB flash drive|USB]] install media. As part of a launch promotion, Microsoft offered ''Windows 8 Pro'' upgrades at a discounted price of US$39.99 online, or $69.99 for retail box from its launch until January 31, 2013; afterward the ''Windows 8'' price has been $119.99 and the Pro price $199.99.&lt;ref name="windowsblog8upgrade"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/07/02/upgrade-to-windows-8-pro-for-39-99.aspx | title=Upgrade to Windows 8 Pro for $39.99 | work=The Windows Blog | date=July 2, 2012 | accessdate=July 29, 2012 | publisher=[[Microsoft]] |first=Brandon |last=LeBlanc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="15dollarupgradeconfirmed"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9227649/Update_Microsoft_confirms_15_Windows_8_upgrade | title=Update: Microsoft confirms $15 Windows 8 upgrade | work=[[Computerworld]] |publisher=[[IDG]] | date=July 1, 2012 | accessdate=July 4, 2012 |first=Gregg |last=Keizer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who purchased new PCs pre-loaded with Windows 7 Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, or Ultimate between June 2, 2012 and January 31, 2013 could digitally purchase a Windows 8 Pro upgrade for US$14.99.&lt;ref name="paulthurrottleak"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.winsupersite.com/blog/supersite-blog-39/windows8/windows-8-pro-pc-upgrade-cost-15-143077 | title=Windows 8 Pro PC Upgrade Cost Is Just $15 | work=Paul Thurrott's Supersite for Windows |publisher=[[Penton (company)|Penton]] | date=May 14, 2012 | accessdate=July 4, 2012 | first=Paul | last=Thurrott |authorlink=Paul Thurrott }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several PC manufacturers offered [[Rebate (marketing)|rebates]] and refunds on Windows 8 upgrades obtained through the promotion on select models, such as [[Hewlett-Packard]] (in the U.S. and Canada on select models), and [[Acer Inc.|Acer]] (in Europe on selected [[Ultrabook]] models).&lt;ref name=pcmag-acerup&gt;{{cite web|title=Acer Offering Free Windows 8 Pro Upgrades for Ultrabook Buyers|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2407108,00.asp|work=PC Magazine|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ts-hpwin8&gt;{{cite web|title=HP offering Windows 8 upgrade refund on select PCs|url=http://www.techspot.com/news/49931-hp-offering-windows-8-upgrade-refund-on-select-pcs.html|publisher=TechSpot|accessdate=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these promotions, the Windows Media Center add-on for ''Windows 8 Pro'' was also offered for free.&lt;ref name="microsoftrevealsprice"/&gt;

Unlike previous versions of Windows, Windows 8 was distributed at retail in "Upgrade" licenses only, which require an existing version of Windows to install. The "full version software" SKU, which was more expensive but could be installed on computers without an eligible OS or none at all, was discontinued. In lieu of full version, a specialized "System Builder" SKU was introduced. The "System Builder" SKU replaced the [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM) SKU, which was only allowed to be used on PCs meant for resale but added a "Personal Use License" exemption that officially allowed its purchase and personal use by users on [[homebuilt computer]]s.&lt;ref name="zdnet-everything81"/&gt;&lt;ref name=smh-misleading/&gt;&lt;ref name=smh-misleading&gt;{{cite web|last=Moses|first=Asher|title=Windows 8 upgrade boxes 'mislead' customers|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/computers/windows-8-upgrade-boxes-mislead-customers-20121128-2acwx.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnet-productkey&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney|first=Lance|title=Windows 8 moves to BIOS-based product keys|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-33642_7-57554240-292/windows-8-moves-to-bios-based-product-keys/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retail distribution of Windows 8 has since been discontinued in favor of [[Windows 8.1]]. Unlike 8, 8.1 is available as "full version software" at both retail and online for download that does not require a previous version of Windows in order to be installed. Pricing for these new copies remain identical.&lt;ref name=ms-8.1skus&gt;{{cite web|title=Pricing and Packaging for Windows 8.1|url=http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2013/09/17/pricing-and-packaging-for-windows-8-1.aspx|work=Blogging Windows|publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the retail release returning to full version software for Windows 8.1, the  "Personal Use License" exemption was removed from the OEM SKU, meaning that end users building their own PCs for personal use must use the full retail version in order to satisfy the Windows 8.1 licensing requirements.&lt;ref name="zdnet-everything81"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bott|first1=Ed|title=Everything you need to know about your Windows 8.1 upgrade options|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-you-need-to-know-about-your-windows-8-1-upgrade-options/|website=ZDNet|accessdate=January 26, 2015|date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Windows 8.1 with Bing'' is a special OEM-specific SKU of ''Windows 8.1'' subsidized by Microsoft's [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] search engine.&lt;ref name=ms-windows8withbing/&gt;

==Software compatibility==
The three desktop editions of Windows 8 support 32-bit and 64-bit architectures; retail copies of Windows 8 include install DVDs for both architectures, while the online installer automatically installs the version corresponding with the architecture of the system's existing Windows installation.&lt;ref name="microsoftrevealsprice"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pt-8box&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 8 Pro Retail Box|url=http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/windows-8-pro-retail-box|work=Paul Thurrott's Supersite for Windows|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 32-bit version runs on CPUs compatible with [[x86]] architecture [[Intel 80786|3rd generation]] (known as [[IA-32]]) or newer, and can run [[32-bit]] and [[16-bit]] [[application software|applications]], although 16-bit support must be enabled first.&lt;ref name="neowin on 16-bit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Callaham|first=John|title=Microsoft: Windows 8 32-bit can still run 16-bit apps|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-windows-8-32-bit-can-still-run-16-bit-apps|work=Neowin.net|publisher=Neowin|accessdate=December 16, 2012|date=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 8 will run 16-bit apps, says Microsoft|url=http://www.winbeta.org/news/windows-8-will-run-16-bit-apps-says-microsoft|work=WinBeta|accessdate=December 16, 2012|date=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (16-bit applications are developed for CPUs compatible with [[Intel 80786|x86 2nd generation, first conceived in 1978]].

The 64-bit version runs on CPUs compatible with x86 [[Intel 80786|8th generation]] (known as [[x86-64]], or x64) or newer, and can run 32-bit and [[64-bit]] programs. 32-bit programs and operating system are restricted to supporting only {{nowrap|4 [[gigabyte]]s}} of memory while 64-bit systems can theoretically support {{nowrap|2048 gigabytes}} of memory.&lt;ref name=64vs32&gt;{{cite web|title=32-bit and 64-bit Windows: frequently asked questions|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions|work=Windows Support portal|publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 64-bit operating systems require a different set of device drivers than those of 32-bit operating systems.&lt;ref name=64vs32 /&gt;

Windows RT, the only edition of Windows 8 for systems with [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processors, only supports applications included with the system (such as a special version of [[Office 2013]]), supplied through Windows Update, or Windows Store apps, to ensure that the system only runs applications that are optimized for the architecture.

===Pre-release===
&lt;!--Maybe put reviews of the preview builds here too? --&gt;
Following the unveiling of Windows 8, Microsoft faced criticism (particularly from [[free software]] supporters) for mandating that devices receiving its optional certification for Windows 8 have secure boot enabled by default using a key provided by Microsoft. Concerns were raised that secure boot could [[Vendor lock-in|prevent or hinder]] the use of alternate operating systems such as [[Linux]]. In a post discussing secure boot on the ''Building Windows 8'' blog, Microsoft developer Tony Mangefeste indicated that vendors would provide means to customize secure boot, stating that "At the end of the day, the customer is in control of their PC.

However, Tom Warren of ''The Verge'' noted that other vendors have implemented similar hardware restrictions on their own ARM-based tablet and smartphone products (including those running Microsoft's own [[Windows Phone]] platform), but still argued that Microsoft should "keep a consistent approach across ARM and x86, though, not least because of the number of users who'd love to run Android alongside Windows 8 on their future tablets."&lt;ref name=warren /&gt;&lt;ref name=warren&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/2012/1/16/2710502/microsoft-secure-boot-windows-8-arm |title=Windows 8 ARM devices won't have the option to switch off Secure Boot |first=Tom |last=Warren |work=[[The Verge]] |date=January 16, 2012 |accessdate=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired-sb"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Garling |first=Caleb |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2011/09/windows-8-secure-boot-sparks-linux-furor-and-a-microsoft-response/ |title=Windows 8 Secure Boot Sparks Linux Furor, and a Microsoft Response |work=[[Wired.com]] |publisher=Condé Nast |date=September 23, 2011 |accessdate=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Brodkin |url=https://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/01/microsoft-mandating-secure-boot-on-arm-making-linux-installs-difficult.ars |title=Microsoft mandating Secure Boot on ARM, making Linux installs difficult |work=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=Condé Nast |date=January 16, 2012 |accessdate=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; No mandate is made regarding the installation of third-party certificates that would enable running alternative programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworlduk.com/blogs/open-enterprise/is-microsoft-blocking-linux-booting-on-arm-hardware-3569162/|title=Is Microsoft Blocking Linux Booting on ARM Hardware?|first=Glyn |last=Moody|date=January 12, 2012|work=[[Computerworld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.computerworld.com/19577/why_microsoft_should_lift_the_possible_ban_on_linux_booting_on_windows_arm_devices |title=Why Microsoft should lift the possible ban on Linux booting on Windows 8 ARM devices |work=[[Computerworld]] |publisher=[[IDG]] |date=January 13, 2012 |accessdate=January 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518223506/http://blogs.computerworld.com/19577/why_microsoft_should_lift_the_possible_ban_on_linux_booting_on_windows_arm_devices |archivedate=May 18, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=James |last=Niccolai |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9223446/Windows_8_on_ARM_You_can_look_but_you_can_t_touch |title=Windows 8 on ARM: You can look but you can't touch |work=[[Computerworld]] |publisher=[[IDG]] |date=January 13, 2012 |accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several notable video game developers criticized Microsoft for making its Windows Store a [[closed platform]] subject to its own regulations, as it conflicted with their view of the [[personal computer|PC]] as an [[open platform]]. [[Markus Persson|Markus "Notch" Persson]] (creator of the [[indie game]] ''[[Minecraft]]''),&lt;ref name=bbc-win8minecraft&gt;{{cite web|title=Minecraft creator attacks Microsoft's Windows 8 plan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19760977|publisher=BBC|work=BBC News|accessdate= October 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gabe Newell]] (co-founder of [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] and developer of software distribution platform [[Steam (software)|Steam]]),&lt;ref name=GabeNewell&gt;{{cite web|title=Valve's Gabe Newell on the Future of Games, Wearable Computers, Windows 8 and More|url=http://allthingsd.com/20120725/valves-gabe-newell-on-the-future-of-games-wearable-computers-windows-8-and-more|work=All Things D|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company|accessdate= October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rob Pardo]] from [[Activision Blizzard]] voiced concern about the closed nature of the Windows Store.&lt;ref name=RobPardo&gt;{{cite web|title=Blizzard's Rob Pardo: Windows 8 is "not awesome" for the company|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/blizzards-rob-pardo-windows-8-is-not-awesome-for-the-company|work=[[Neowin]]|publisher=Neowin, LLC|accessdate= October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tom Warren of ''The Verge'' stated that Microsoft's addition of the Store was simply responding to the success of both Apple and Google in pursuing the "curated application store approach."&lt;ref name=verge-w8/&gt;

===Critical reception===
Reviews of the various editions of Windows 8 have been mixed to negative. Tom Warren of ''[[The Verge]]'' said that although Windows 8's emphasis on touch computing was significant and risked alienating desktop users, he felt that Windows 8 tablets "[make] an [[iPad]] feel immediately out of date" due to the capabilities of the operating system's hybrid model and increased focus on cloud services.&lt;ref name=verge-w8/&gt; David Pierce of ''The Verge'' described Windows 8 as "the first desktop operating system that understands what a computer is supposed to do in 2012" and praised Microsoft's "no compromise" approach and the operating system's emphasis on Internet connectivity and cloud services. Pierce also considered the Start Screen to be a "brilliant innovation for desktop computers" when compared with "folder-littered desktops on every other OS" because it allows users to interact with dynamic information.&lt;ref name="DavidPierce"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/16/3246185/this-is-my-next-windows-8 |title=This is my next: Windows 8 |last=Pierce |first=David |date=August 16, 2012 |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |work=The Verge |accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, an ''[[ExtremeTech]]'' article said it was Microsoft "flailing"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the included apps in Windows 8 were considered to be basic and lacking in functionality, but the Xbox apps were praised for their promotion of a multi-platform entertainment experience. Other improvements and features (such as File History, Storage Spaces, and the updated Task Manager) were also regarded as positive changes.&lt;ref name=verge-w8&gt;{{cite web|last=Warren|first=Tom|title=Windows 8 review|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3537710/windows-8-review|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Bright of [[Ars Technica]] wrote that while its user interface changes may overshadow them, Windows 8's improved performance, updated file manager, new storage functionality, expanded security features, and updated Task Manager were still positive improvements for the operating system. Bright also said that Windows 8's duality towards tablets and traditional PCs was an "extremely ambitious" aspect of the platform as well, but criticized Microsoft for emulating [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s model of a closed distribution platform when implementing the Windows Store.&lt;ref name=ars-w8review/&gt;

The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of negative reaction. Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping "wasn't very obvious" due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface, even by the video tutorial added on the [[Software release life cycle#RTM|RTM]] release (which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides). Despite this "[[stumbling block]]", Bright said that Windows 8's interface worked well in some places, but began to feel incoherent when switching between the "Metro" and desktop environments, sometimes through inconsistent means.&lt;ref name=ars-w8review&gt;{{cite web|last=Bright|first=Peter|title=Windows, reimagined: A review of Windows 8|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/10/windows-reimagined-a-review-of-windows-8/|work=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Warren of ''The Verge'' wrote that the new interface was "as stunning as it is surprising", contributing to an "incredibly personal" experience once it is customized by the user, but had a steep learning curve, and was awkward to use with a keyboard and mouse. He noted that while forcing all users to use the new touch-oriented interface was a risky move for Microsoft as a whole, it was necessary in order to push development of apps for the Windows Store.&lt;ref name=verge-w8/&gt; Others, such as Adrian Kingsley-Hughes from [[ZDNet]], considered the interface to be "clumsy and impractical" due to its inconsistent design (going as far as considering it "two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together"), and concluded that "Windows 8 wasn't born out of a need or demand; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction—touch and tablets – that allows it to compete against, and remain relevant in the face of Apple's iPad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kingsley-Hughes |first=Adrian |url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/final-thoughts-on-windows-8-a-design-disaster/20706 |title=Final thoughts on Windows 8: A design disaster |work=[[ZDNet]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=June 7, 2012 |accessdate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Frank X.

Windows 8 surpassed [[Windows Vista]] in market share with a 5.1% usage rate according to numbers posted in July 2013 by [[Net Applications]], with usage on a steady upward trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvey |first=Cynthia |url=http://www.datamation.com/news/net-applications-windows-8-captures-5.1-market-share.html |title=Net Applications: Windows 8 Captures 5.1% Market Share |work=Datamation |publisher=[[Quinstreet]] |date=July 1, 2013 |accessdate=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, intake of Windows 8 still lags behind that of [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]] at the same point in their release cycles. Windows 8's tablet market share has also been growing steadily, with 7.4% of tablets running Windows in Q1 2013 according to Strategy Analytics, up from nothing just a year before. However, this is still well below [[Android OS|Android]] and [[Apple iOS|iOS]], which posted 43.4% and 48.2% market share respectively, although both operating systems have been on the market much longer than Windows 8.&lt;ref name = "Strategy Analytics"&gt;{{cite web|first=Natasha |last=Lomas |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/25/strategy-analytics-q1-tablet-stats/ |title=Windows 8 Wins 7.4% Share of Global Tablet OS Market in Q1 – "Niche" Portion Still Beats Windows Phone's Smartphone Share |work=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=April 25, 2013 |accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategy Analytics also noted "a shortage of top tier apps" for Windows tablets despite Microsoft strategy of paying developers to create apps for the operating system (in addition to for Windows Phone).&lt;ref name="Strategy Analytics"/&gt;

In January 2014, [[Hewlett-Packard]] began a promotion for desktops running Windows 7, saying that it was "back by popular demand". Outside sources have suggested that this might be because HP or its customers thought the Windows 8 platform would be more appropriate for mobile computing than desktop computing, or that they were looking to attract customers forced to switch from XP who wanted a more familiar interface.&lt;ref name=verge-hp7&gt;{{cite web|title=HP brings back Windows 7 'by popular demand'|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/20/5326844/hp-brings-back-windows-7-by-popular-demand|work=The Verge|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2089403/ouch-hp-brings-windows-7-back-by-popular-demand.html |title=Ouch: HP brings Windows 7 'back by popular demand' |date=January 20, 2014 |work=PC World |publisher=IDG |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] reported that Microsoft would be lowering the price of Windows 8 licenses by 70% for devices that retail under US$250; alongside the announcement that an update to the operating system would allow OEMs to produce devices with as little as 1 GB of RAM and 16 GB of storage, critics felt that these changes would help Windows compete against Linux-based devices in the low-end market, particularly those running [[Chrome OS]]. Microsoft had similarly cut the price of [[Windows XP]] licenses to compete against the early waves of Linux-based [[netbook]]s.&lt;ref name=verge-springupdate&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft announces 'spring' update for Windows 8.1|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/23/5438734/microsoft-announces-spring-update-for-windows-8-1|work=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-lowercost&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft combats Chromebooks by cutting Windows licensing fees by 70 percent|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/21/5435152/windows-8-1-license-fees-cut-by-70-percent-rumor|work=The Verge|accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports also indicated that Microsoft was planning to offer cheaper Windows 8 licenses to OEMs in exchange for setting Internet Explorer's default search engine to [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]].

===Chinese government ban===
In May 2014, the [[Government of China]] banned the internal purchase of Windows 8-based products under government contracts requiring "energy-efficient" devices. The [[Xinhua News Agency]] claimed that Windows 8 was being banned in protest of Microsoft's support lifecycle policy and the end of support for [[Windows XP]] (which, as of January 2014, had a market share of 49% in China), as the government "obviously cannot ignore the risks of running an OS without guaranteed technical support." However, Ni Guangnan of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] had also previously warned that Windows 8 could allegedly expose users to [[Mass surveillance in the United States|surveillance by the United States government]] due to its heavy use of Internet-based services.&lt;ref name="reuters-win8ban"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/20/us-microsoft-china-idUSBREA4J07Q20140520 | title=China bans use of Microsoft's Windows 8 on government computers | work=[[Reuters]] | accessdate=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-xpwontdie"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26432473 | title=XP – the operating system that will not die | work=[[BBC News]] | accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/china-warns-of-risks-in-plan-to-retire-windows-xp/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1 | title=China Warns of Risks in Plan to Retire Windows XP | work=[[The New York Times]] | accessdate=March 24, 2014 | last=Ramzy | first=Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2157220/china-bans-government-purchases-of-windows-8-surprising-microsoft.html | title=China bans government purchases of Windows 8 | publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] | work=[[PCWorld]] | date=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, [[state broadcaster]] [[China Central Television]] (CCTV) broadcast a news story further characterizing Windows 8 as a threat to national security. The story featured an interview with Ni Guangnan, who stated that operating systems could aggregate "sensitive user information" that could be used to "understand the conditions and activities of our national economy and society", and alleged that per [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|documents leaked by Edward Snowden]], the U.S. government had worked with Microsoft to retrieve encrypted information. Yang Min, a computer scientist at [[Fudan University]], also stated that "the security features of Windows 8 are basically to the benefit of Microsoft, allowing them control of the users' data, and that poses a big challenge to the national strategy for information security." Microsoft denied the claims in a number of posts on the Chinese social network [[Sina Weibo]], which stated that the company had never "assisted any government in an attack of another government or clients" or provided client data to the U.S. government, never "provided any government the authority to directly visit" or placed any [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoors]] in its products and services, and that it had never concealed government requests for client data.&lt;ref name="cnet-clash"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnet.com/news/microsoft-china-clash-over-windows-8-and-charges-of-backdoor-spying/ | title=Microsoft, China clash over Windows 8, backdoor-spying charges | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=June 6, 2014 | website=[[CNET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg-spat"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-05/china-s-jiangsu-dropped-windows-8-earlier-this-year-cctv.html | title=Apple, Microsoft Targets of Chinese Media in U.S. Spat | work=[[Bloomberg News]] | accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cw-retaliates"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240222085/Microsoft-retaliates-to-Chinas-Windows-8-spying-claims | title=Microsoft retaliates to China's Windows 8 spying claims | publisher=[[TechTarget]] | accessdate=June 6, 2014 | website=[[ComputerWeekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature update to Windows 8 known as [[Windows 8.1]] was officially announced by Microsoft on May 14, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2013/03/26/looking-back-and-springing-ahead.aspx |title=Looking Back and Springing Ahead |work=The Official Microsoft Blog: News &amp; Perspectives |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=March 26, 2013 |accessdate=July 17, 2013 |first=Frank X. |last=Shaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leblanc1"&gt;{{cite web|first=Brandon |last=LeBlanc |url=http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2013/05/14/windows-keeps-getting-better.aspx |title=Windows Keeps Getting Better |work=Blogging Windows |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=May 14, 2013 |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a presentation devoted to it at [[Build (developer conference)|Build 2013]], a public beta version of the upgrade was released on June 26, 2013.&lt;ref name=pcw-81previewenterprise&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft releases Windows 8.1 Enterprise preview with VDI, Windows to Go support|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2045561/microsoft-releases-windows-8-1-enterprise-preview-with-vdi-windows-to-go-support.html|work=PC World|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thurrott|first=Paul|title=Download and Install the Windows 8.1 Preview|url=http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/download-and-install-windows-81-preview|work=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows|publisher=[[Penton (company)|Penton]]|authorlink=Paul Thurrott|date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows 8.1 was released to [[Release to manufacturing|OEM hardware partners]] on August 27, 2013, and released publicly as a free upgrade through Windows Store on October 17, 2013.&lt;ref name=ms-8.1skus/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LeBlanc|first=Brandon|title=Mark your calendars for Windows 8.1!|url=http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2013/08/14/mark-your-calendars-for-windows-8-1.aspx|work=Blogging Windows |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/14/technology/enterprise/windows-8-1-update/index.html | title=Windows 8.1 update coming October 18 | work=CNN Money |publisher=[[Time Warner]] | accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volume license customers and subscribers to [[msdn subscription|MSDN Plus]] and [[Microsoft TechNet#Subscriptions and downloads|TechNet Plus]] were initially unable to obtain the RTM version upon its release; a spokesperson said the policy was changed to allow Microsoft to work with OEMs "to ensure a quality experience at general availability."&lt;ref name=ext-81rtm&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft confirms Windows 8.1 RTM, but expect a large bug-fixing patch on release|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/164983-microsoft-confirms-windows-8-1-rtm-but-expect-a-large-bug-fixing-patch-on-release|work=[[ExtremeTech]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis Media]]|accessdate=September 2, 2013 |first=Sebastian |last=Anthony |date=August 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tnw-msdnsp1&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 7 SP1 RTM is out for MSDN and TechNet customers|url=https://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2011/02/16/windows-7-sp1-rtm-is-out-for-msdn-and-technet-customers/|work=TheNextWeb.com |publisher=The Next Web |accessdate=September 2, 2013 |first=Alex |last=Wilhelm |date=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after criticism, Microsoft reversed its decision and released the RTM build on MSDN and TechNet on September 9, 2013.&lt;ref name=verge-rtmmsdn&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 8.1 now available on MSDN and TechNet following developer complaints|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/9/4710174/windows-8-1-msdn-technet-download-now-available|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows 8.1 addressed a number of criticisms faced by Windows 8 upon its release, with additional customization options for the Start screen, the restoration of a visible Start button on the desktop, the ability to snap up to four apps on a single display, and the ability to boot to the desktop instead of the Start screen. Windows 8's stock apps were also updated, a new [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]]-based unified search system was added, [[SkyDrive]] was given deeper integration with the operating system, and a number of new stock apps, along with a tutorial, were added.&lt;ref name="verge-81handson"&gt;{{cite web|first=Evan |last=Rodgers |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/26/4465888/windows-8-1-preview-video |title=Windows 8.1: a first look at what Microsoft is changing |work=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=June 26, 2013 |accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pcw-81review&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 8.1 review: The great compromise|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2048508/windows-8-1-review-the-great-compromise.html|work=PC World|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pt-81utility&gt;{{cite web|title=Hands-On with Windows 8.1: New Utility Apps|url=http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/hands-windows-81-new-utility-apps|work=Paul Thurrott's Supersite for Windows|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thurrott|first=Paul|title=In Blue: Windows Store 2.0|url=http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/blue-windows-store-20|work=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows|publisher=[[Penton Media|Penton]]|accessdate=June 18, 2013|authorlink=Paul Thurrott|date=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows 8.1 also added support for [[3D printing]],&lt;ref name=engadget-81-3dprinting&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 8.1 to support 3D printing through native API|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/06/26/windows-8-1-to-natively-support-3d-printing/|work=Engadget|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=windowsex-3dprinting81&gt;{{cite web|title=3D Printing Support in Windows 8.1 Explained|url=http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/extremewindows/archive/2013/08/22/3d-printing-support-in-windows-8-1-explained.aspx|work=Extreme Windows|publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miracast]] media streaming, [[Near field communication|NFC]] printing, and [[Wi-Fi Direct]].&lt;ref name="windows1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/business/archive/2013/06/03/modern-business-in-mind-windows-8-1-at-teched-2013.aspx |title=Modern Business in Mind: Windows 8.1 at TechEd 2013 |work=Windows for your business |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |date=June 3, 2013 |accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft marketed Windows 8.1 as an "update" rather than as a "[[service pack]]", as it had done with such revisions on previous versions of Windows.&lt;ref name=cw-updatenotanupdate&gt;{{cite web|title=When is a Windows update not an update?

Retail and OEM installations of Windows 8, Windows 8 ''Pro'', and [[Windows RT]] can be upgraded through [[Windows Store]] free of charge. However, [[volume licensing|volume license]] customers, TechNet or MSDN subscribers and users of Windows 8 Enterprise must acquire a standalone installation media for 8.1 and install through the traditional Windows setup process, either as an in-place upgrade or clean install. This requires an 8.1-specific product key.&lt;ref name=cw-81updateproblem&gt;{{cite web|title=Small biz admins squawk over Windows 8.1 updates| url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243345/Small_biz_admins_squawk_over_Windows_8.1_updates| work=[[ComputerWorld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why can't I find the update in the Store?|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/why-can-t-find-update-store|work=Windows portal|publisher=[[Microsoft]] |accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=supersite-81woes&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 8.1 Upgrade Woes|url=http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/windows-81-upgrade-woes|work=Paul Thurrott's Supersite for Windows|accessdate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=supersite-81enter&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 8.1 Tip: Upgrade from Windows 8 Enterprise|url=http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/windows-81-tip-upgrade-windows-8-enterprise|work=Paul Thurrott's Supersite for Windows|accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
