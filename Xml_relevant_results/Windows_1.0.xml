'''Windows 1.0''' is a [[Graphical user interface|graphical]] [[personal computer]] [[operating environment]] developed by [[Microsoft]] and worked on by [[Gabe Newell]]. Microsoft had worked with [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] to develop applications for Apple's January 1984 [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]], the first mass-produced personal computer with a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) that enabled users to see [[user friendly]] icons on screen.  Windows 1.0 was released on November 20, 1985, as the first version of the [[Microsoft Windows]] line. It runs as a graphical, [[16-bit]] [[Computer multitasking|multi-tasking]] [[shell (computing)|shell]] on top of an existing [[MS-DOS]] installation. It provides an environment which can run graphical [[Computer program|programs]] designed for Windows, as well as existing [[MS-DOS]] software. Its development was spearheaded by the company founder [[Bill Gates]] after he saw a demonstration of a similar software suite known as [[Visi On]] at [[COMDEX]].

Despite positive responses to its early presentations and support from a number of hardware and software makers, Windows 1.0 was received poorly by critics. Critics felt Windows 1.0 did not meet their expectations. In particular, they felt that Windows 1.0 put too much emphasis on [[mouse (computing)|mouse]] input at a time when mouse use was not yet widespread; not providing enough resources for new users; and for performance issues, especially on systems with lower [[computer hardware]] specifications. Despite these criticisms, Windows 1.0 was an important milestone for Microsoft, as it introduced the [[Microsoft Windows]] line.&lt;ref name="cnet-flop" /&gt; On December 31, 2001, Windows 1.0 was declared obsolete and Microsoft stopped providing support and updates for the system.

== History ==
[[File:Microsoft Windows 1.0 page1.jpg|thumb|right|A Microsoft Windows 1.0 brochure published in January 1986]]

[[Microsoft]] began developing a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) in 1981.&lt;ref name="alsop19880118"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Alsop |first=Stewart II |date=1988-01-18 |title=Microsoft Windows: Eclectism in UI |url=http://vintagecomputer.net/cisc367/PC-Letter_19880118.pdf |journal=P.C. Letter |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=6-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of Windows began after Microsoft founder [[Bill Gates]] saw a demonstration at [[COMDEX]] 1982 of [[VisiCorp]]'s [[Visi On]], a GUI software suite for [[IBM PC compatible]] computers.&lt;ref name=verge-gracefullyfailed /&gt; In 1983 Microsoft learned that Apple's own GUI software—based in part on [[Xerox PARC]] technology–was much more sophisticated, and decided that its own product would be different.{{r|alsop19880118}}

Microsoft first presented Windows to the public on November 10, 1983.&lt;ref name="MS Windows 1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Markoff | first = John | title = Microsoft Does Windows | journal = [[InfoWorld]] | volume = 5 | issue = 47 | pages = 32–36 | publisher = Popular Computing | location = [[Menlo Park, CA]] | date = November 21, 1983| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uy8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 | issn = 0199-6649|quote = On November 10, in New York, Microsoft announced Windows… Microsoft says it will ship Windows to dealers in April (although a product like Windows is difficult to predict and may take longer), priced between $100 and $250,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Requiring two [[floppy disk]] drives and 192&amp;nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] of RAM, Microsoft described the software as a [[device driver]] for [[MS-DOS|MS-DOS 2.0]]. By supporting [[cooperative multitasking]] in [[tiling window manager|tiled windows]] when using well-behaved applications that only used DOS [[system call]]s, and permitting non-well-behaved applications to run in a full screen, Windows differed from both Visi On and [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]{{'}}s [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] by immediately offering many applications. Unlike Visi On, Windows developers did not need to use [[Unix]] to develop IBM PC applications; Microsoft planned to encourage other companies, including competitors, to develop programs for Windows by not requiring a Microsoft [[user interface]] in their applications.{{r|lemmons198312}}

Many manufacturers of MS-DOS computers such as [[Compaq]], [[Zenith Data Systems|Zenith]], and [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] promised to provide support, as did software companies such as [[Ashton-Tate]] and [[Lotus Software|Lotus]].{{r|MS Windows 1983}} After previewing Windows, ''[[BYTE]]'' magazine stated in December 1983 that it "seems to offer remarkable openness, reconfigurability, and transportability as well as modest hardware requirements and pricing … Barring a surprise product introduction from another company, Microsoft Windows will be the first large-scale test of the [[desktop computer|desktop]] metaphor in the hands of its intended users".&lt;ref name="lemmons198312"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1983-12/1983_12_BYTE_08-12_Easy_Software#page/n49/mode/2up | title=Microsoft Windows | work=[[BYTE]] | date=December 1983 | author=Lemmons |page = 48|publication-date = December 1983|first = Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From early in Windows' history Gates viewed it as Microsoft's future. He told ''InfoWorld'' magazine in April 1984 that "Our strategies and energies as a company are totally committed to Windows, in the same way that we're committed to operating-system [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]]s like [[MS-DOS]] and [[Xenix]]. We're also saying that only applications that take advantage of Windows will be competitive in the long run."&lt;ref name="caruso19840402"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kC4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Company Strategies Boomerang | work=InfoWorld | date=April 2, 1984 | accessdate=February 10, 2015 | author=Caruso, Denise | pages=80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IBM]] was notably absent from Microsoft's announcement,{{r|MS Windows 1983}} and by late 1984, the press reported a "War of the Windows" between Windows, IBM's [[TopView]], and [[Digital Research]]'s [[Graphics Environment Manager]] (GEM).&lt;ref name="rosch19841225"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=azbgSlPdJawC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=The Curtain Rises On The War of the Windows | work=[[PC Magazine]] | date=December 25, 1984 | accessdate=October 25, 2013 | last=Rosch |first=Winn L. | page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft had promised in November 1983 to ship Windows by April 1984,{{r|MS Windows 1983}} but subsequently denied that it had announced a release date, and predicted that Windows would ship by June 1985. During its development and before its windowing system was developed, it was briefly referred to by the codename Interface Manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanson|first1=Rowland|title=WINDOWS IS NAMED WINDOWS : BUT WHY?|url=https://thehmccompany.com/windows-is-named-windows-but-why/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deemphasizing multitasking, the company stated that Windows' purpose, unlike that of [[TopView]], was to "turn the computer into a [[graphics]]-rich environment" while using less memory.{{r|rosch19841225}} After Microsoft persuaded IBM that the latter needed a GUI,{{r|alsop19880118}} in April 1987 the two companies announced the introduction of [[OS/2]] and its graphical OS/2 [[Presentation Manager]], which were supposed to ultimately replace both [[MS-DOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].&lt;ref name="History of Windows"&gt;{{cite web| title = A history of Windows| publisher = [[Microsoft]] | year = 2012 | url = http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/history | quote = On November 20, 1985, two years after the initial announcement, Microsoft ships Windows 1.0. | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117023025/http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/history|archivedate = November 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1987, Windows 1.0 was succeeded by [[Windows 2.0]]. Microsoft supported Windows 1.0 for 16 years, until December 31, 2001 – the longest out of all versions of Windows.&lt;ref name="obsolete-prod"&gt;{{cite web

===Windows 1.01===

Version 1.01, released on November 20, 1985, was the first public release of Windows &lt;ref&gt;{{cite_web|url=http://copy.sh/v86/?profile=windows1|title=Windows - Virtual x86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows 1.02===
Version 1.02, released in May 1986, was an international release.

===Windows 1.03===
Version 1.03, released in August 1986, included enhancements that made it consistent with the international release like [[Device driver|driver]]s for European keyboards and additional screen and printer drivers.

===Windows 1.04===
Version 1.04, released in April 1987, added support for the new [[IBM Personal System/2|IBM PS/2]] computers, although no support for PS/2 mice or new [[VGA]] graphics modes was provided. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winhistory.de/more/win1.htm|title=Windows 1|website=Winhistory.de|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in May 27 1987, an OEM version was released by IBM, which added VGA support, PS/2 mouse support, MCGA support, and support for the [[8514|8514/A]] display driver.&lt;ref name="Win-IBM"&gt; {{citeweb|url=https://win1.krnl386.com/versions/oem/104ps2.html|accessdate=12 April 2019|title=Version 1 for IBM PS/2|language=English|website=win1.krnl386.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM PS2 OEM Microsoft Windows 1.04 - 720k|url=https://archive.org/details/IBMWindows104720k |website=archive.org|accessdate=12 April 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM released this version on three 3.5 inch 720k floppies, and offered it as part of their "Personal Publishing System" and "Collegiate Kit" bundles.&lt;ref name="Win-IBM" /&gt;

[[File:Microsoft Windows 1.01 multitasking.png|thumb|right|[[Computer multitasking|Multitasking]] capabilities of Microsoft Windows 1.01 released in 1985, here shown running the MS-DOS Executive and Calculator programs]]

Windows 1.0 offers limited multitasking of existing MS-DOS programs and concentrates on creating an interaction [[paradigm]] (cf. [[Message loop in Microsoft Windows|message loop]]), an execution model and a stable [[Application programming interface|API]] for [[native mode|native]] programs for the future. Due to Microsoft's extensive support for [[backward compatibility]], it is not only possible to execute Windows 1.0 [[executable|binary]] programs on current versions (albeit only 32-bit) of Windows to a large extent, but also to recompile their [[source code]] into an equally functional "modern" application with just limited modifications. Windows 1.0 is often regarded as a "[[Front-end and back-end|front-end]] to the [[MS-DOS]] [[operating system]]", a description which has also been applied to subsequent versions of Windows. Windows 1.0 is an MS-DOS program. Windows 1.0 programs can call MS-DOS functions, and GUI programs are run from [[EXE|.exe]] files just like MS-DOS programs. However, Windows .exe files had their own "new executable" (NE) file format, which only Windows could process and which, for example, allowed demand-loading of code and data. Applications were supposed to handle memory only through Windows' own memory management system, which implemented a software-based [[virtual memory]] scheme allowing for applications larger than available [[Random access memory|RAM]].

Because graphics support in [[MS-DOS]] is extremely limited, MS-DOS applications have to go to the bare hardware (or sometimes just to the [[BIOS]]) to get work done. Therefore, Windows 1.0 included original [[device driver]]s for video cards, a mouse, keyboards, printers and serial communications, and applications were supposed to only invoke APIs built upon these drivers. However, this extended to other APIs such as file system management functions. In this sense, Windows 1.0 was designed to be extended into a full-fledged operating system, rather than being just a graphics environment used by applications. Indeed, Windows 1.0 is a "DOS front-end" and cannot operate without a DOS environment (it uses, for example, the file-handling functions provided by DOS.) The level of replacement increases in subsequent versions. The system requirements for Windows 1.01 constituted [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]]/[[Hercules Graphics Card|HGC]]/[[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] (listed as "Monochrome or color monitor"), MS-DOS 2.0, 256&amp;nbsp;KB of memory or greater, and two double-sided disk drives or a hard drive.&lt;ref name="microsoft-obs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows Version History|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/32905|website=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|date=September 23, 2011 |edition=4.0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with version 1.03, support for Tandy and AT&amp;T graphics modes was added.

[[File:MS-DOS Executive, Windows 1.04.png|thumb|MS-DOS Executive file manager.]]

Windows 1.0 runs a [[operating system shell|shell]] program known as the [[MS-DOS Executive]], which is little more than a mouse-able output of the DIR command that does not support icons and is not [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K]]-compliant. Other supplied programs are [[Microsoft Calculator|Calculator]], [[Calendar (Windows)|Calendar]], [[Clipboard Viewer]], Clock, [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]], [[Microsoft Paint|Paint]], [[Reversi]],  [[Cardfile]], [[Terminal emulator|Terminal]] and [[Windows Write|Write]]. Windows 1.0 does not allow overlapping windows. Instead all windows are [[tiling window manager|tiled]]. Only dialog boxes can appear over other windows, but cannot be minimized.

==Reception==
Windows 1.0 was released to mixed reviews.  Most critics considered the platform to have future potential, but that Windows 1.0 had not fulfilled expectations. Many reviews criticized its demanding system requirements, especially noting the poor performance experienced when running multiple applications at once, and that Windows encouraged the use of a mouse for navigation, a relatively new concept at the time.&lt;ref name="verge-gracefullyfailed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revisiting Windows 1.0: how Microsoft’s first desktop gracefully failed|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/20/3671922/windows-1-0-microsoft-history-desktop-gracefully-failed|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher = [[Vox Media]]|date = November 20, 2012|accessdate=January 21, 2017|first=Sean|last=Hollister}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' compared the performance of Windows on a system with 512&amp;nbsp;KB of RAM to "pouring [[molasses]] in the Arctic", and that its design was inflexible for keyboard users due to its dependency on a mouse-oriented interface. In conclusion, the ''Times'' felt that the poor performance, lack of dedicated software, uncertain compatibility with DOS programs, and the lack of tutorials for new users made DOS-based software such as [[Borland Sidekick]] (which could provide a similar assortment of accessories and multitasking functionality) more desirable for most PC users.&lt;ref name="nyt-w1review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Computers; Windows Are Open At Last|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/25/science/personal-computers-windows-are-open-at-last.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 11, 2013|first = Erik |last = Sandberg-Diment|date=February 25, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retrospect, Windows 1.0 was regarded as a flop by contemporary technology publications, who, however, still acknowledged its overall importance to the history of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows line]].&lt;ref name="cnet-flop"&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 1.0: The flop that created an empire|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-57613051-75/windows-1.0-the-flop-that-created-an-empire/|work=[[CNET]]|publisher = [[CBS Interactive]]|first = Charles|last = Cooper|date = November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-gracefullyfailed /&gt; [[Nathaniel Borenstein]] (who went on to develop the [[MIME]] standards) and his IT team at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] were also critical of Windows when it was first presented to them by a group of Microsoft representatives. Underestimating the future impact of the platform, he believed that in comparison to an in-house window manager, "these guys came in with this pathetic and naïve system. We just knew they were never going to accomplish anything."&lt;ref name=nw-windows1-25&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows 1.0 turning 25: First experiences recalled|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/110810-windows-turns-25.html|work=NetworkWorld|accessdate=November 11, 2013|first=Jon|last=Brodkin|date=November 8, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110190232/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/110810-windows-turns-25.html|archivedate=November 10, 2010|df=ymd}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Verge]]'' considered the poor reception towards the release of [[Windows 8]] in 2012 as a parallel to Microsoft's struggles with early versions of Windows. In a similar fashion to Windows 1.0 running atop MS-DOS as a layer, Windows 8 offered a new type of interface and software geared towards an emerging form of [[human interface device]] on PCs, in this case, a [[touchscreen]] (software which, coincidentally, also could not run in overlapping windows, and only "snapped" to the side of the screen), running atop the [[Legacy system|legacy]] [[Windows shell]] used by previous versions.&lt;ref name=verge-gracefullyfailed /&gt;

A mock version of Windows 1.0 was created by Microsoft as an app for [[Windows 10]] as part of a tie-in with the [[Netflix]] show, ''[[Stranger Things]]'', aligned with the release of the show's [[Stranger Things (season 3)|third season]] which takes place during 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/8/20685881/microsoft-windows-1-11-app-stranger-things-3-1985 | title =  Microsoft’s new Windows 1.11 app is a Stranger Things trip back to 1985 | first = Tom | last =Warren | date = July 8, 2019 | accessdate = July 8, 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
