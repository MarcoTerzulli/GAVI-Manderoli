'''Pixar Animation Studios''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|k|s|ɑr}}) is an American [[Computer animation|computer]] [[animation studio]] based in [[Emeryville, California]], a [[subsidiary]] of [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]]. Pixar began in 1979 as part of the [[Lucasfilm]] computer division, known as the '''Graphics Group''', before its [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off as a corporation]] on February 3, 1986, with funding from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]], who became its [[majority shareholder]].&lt;ref name="Pixar Founding Documents"&gt;{{cite web|first=Alvy Ray |last=Smith |authorlink=Alvy Ray Smith |url=http://alvyray.com/Pixar/default.htm |title=Pixar Founding Documents |website=Alvy Ray Smith Homepage |accessdate=January 11, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050427012806/http://alvyray.com/Pixar/default.htm |archivedate=April 27, 2005 |url-status=dead |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] purchased Pixar in 2006 at a [[Company valuation|valuation]] of $7.4 billion by converting each share of Pixar stock to 2.3 shares of Disney stock,&lt;ref name="Walt-Disney-Company-Jan-2006-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/2784/0001193125-06-012082.pdf |title=Walt Disney Company, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Jan 26, 2006 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walt-Disney-Company-May-2006-8-K"/&gt; a transaction that resulted in Jobs becoming Disney's largest single shareholder at the time. Pixar is best known for its [[feature film]]s technologically powered by [[RenderMan (software)|RenderMan]], the company's own implementation of the industry-standard [[RenderMan Interface Specification]] [[Rendering (computer graphics)|image-rendering]] [[application programming interface]]. [[Luxo Jr. (character)|Luxo Jr.]], a character from the studio's [[Luxo Jr.|1986 short film of the same name]], is the studio's [[mascot]].

Pixar has produced [[List of Pixar films|22 feature films]], beginning with ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995), which was the first ever computer-animated feature film; its most recent film was ''[[Onward (film)|Onward]]'' (2020). All of the studio's films have debuted with [[CinemaScore]] ratings of at least an "A−," which indicates a positive reception with audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.deadline.com/2013/06/world-war-z-begins-international-roll-out-strongly-in-australia-korea/ |title=Monsters University' Global Total $136.5M: #1 N.A.

Moreover, 15 of Pixar's films are in the [[list of highest-grossing animated films|50 highest-grossing animated films of all time]].

The studio has earned 20 [[Academy Awards]], 8 [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and 11 [[Grammy Award]]s, along with numerous [[list of Pixar awards and nominations|other awards and acknowledgments]]. Many of Pixar's films have been nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], since its inauguration in 2001, with ten Pixar winners being ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003), ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004), ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'' (2007), ''[[WALL-E]]'' (2008), ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' (2009), ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' (2010), ''[[Brave (2012 film)|Brave]]'' (2012), ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' (2015), ''[[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]]'' (2017), and ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' (2019); the three that were nominated for the award without winning it are ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' (2001), ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' (2006), and ''Incredibles 2'' (2018). In addition to that award, ''Up'' and ''Toy Story 3'' were also the second and third animated films, respectively, to be nominated for the more inclusive [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] (the first being [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' in 1991).

On September 6, 2009, Pixar executives [[John Lasseter]], [[Brad Bird]], [[Pete Docter]], [[Andrew Stanton]], and [[Lee Unkrich]] were presented with the [[Golden Lion]] award for [[Lifetime Achievement]] by the [[Venice Film Festival]]. As part of the ceremony, the physical award was handed to [[Lucasfilm|Lucasfilm's]] founder, [[George Lucas]].

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Pixar Computer - computer history museum 2013-04-11 23-46.jpg|thumb|200px| A Pixar computer at the [[Computer History Museum]] in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]] with the 1986–95 logo on it]]
Pixar got its start in 1974 when [[New York Institute of Technology]]'s (NYIT) founder, [[Alexander Schure]], who was also the owner of a traditional animation studio, established the [[New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab|Computer Graphics Lab]] (CGL), recruited [[computer scientists]] who shared his ambitions about creating the world's first computer-animated film. [[Edwin Catmull]] and [[Malcolm Blanchard]] were the first to be hired and were soon joined by [[Alvy Ray Smith]] and [[David DiFrancesco]] some months later, which were the four original members of the '''Computer Graphics Lab'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/nyit/masson/nyit.html|title=Brief History of the New York Institute of Technology Computer Graphics Lab|publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schure kept pouring money into the computer graphics lab, an estimated $15&amp;nbsp;million, giving the group everything they desired and driving NYIT into serious financial troubles.&lt;ref name="The Story Behind Pixar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mixergy.com/interviews/the-story-behind-pixar-with-alvy-ray-smith/|title=The Story Behind Pixar - with Alvy Ray Smith|publisher=mixergy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the group realized they needed to work in a real [[film studio]] in order to reach their goal. [[Francis Ford Coppola]] then invited Smith to his house for a three-day media conference, where Coppola and [[George Lucas]] shared their visions for the future of digital moviemaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.no/books?id=WOwyRnZ1oxoC&amp;pg=PA137 |page=137 |title=Moving Innovation: A History of Computer Animation |isbn=9780262019095 |last1=Sito |first1=Tom |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Lucas approached them and offered them a job at his studio, six employees decided to move over to [[Lucasfilm]]. During the following months, they gradually resigned from CGL, found temporary jobs for about a year to avoid making Schure suspicious, before joining the Graphics Group at Lucasfilm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lowendmac.com/2014/cgi-story-the-development-of-computer-generated-imaging/|title=CGI Story: The Development of Computer Generated Imaging|date=June 8, 2014|publisher=lowendmac.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/PDFs/NYITMagazineOutofthisWorld|title=ID 797 - History of Computer Graphics and Animation|publisher=[[Ohio State University]]|access-date=October 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110013620/http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/PDFs/NYITMagazineOutofthisWorld|archive-date=January 10, 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Graphics Group, which was one-third of the Computer Division of Lucasfilm, was launched in 1979 with the hiring of Catmull from NYIT,&lt;ref name="pixar story"&gt;{{cite web | author=Hormby, Thomas| publisher=Low End Mac | title =The Pixar Story: Fallon Forbes, Dick Shoup, Alex Schure, George Lucas and Disney | date =January 22, 2007|url =http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/pixar-story-lucas-disney.html | accessdate =March 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was in charge of the Computer Graphics Lab. He was then reunited with Smith, who also made the journey from NYIT to Lucasfilm, and was made the director of the Graphics Group. At NYIT, the researchers pioneered many of the CG foundation techniques—in particular, the invention of the [[alpha channel]] (by Catmull and Smith).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Alvy Ray|authorlink=Alvy Ray Smith|title=Alpha and the History of Digital Compositing|url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring12/cos426/papers/Smith95c.pdf|publisher=Princeton University—Department of Computer Science|accessdate=December 22, 2013|date=August 15, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several years, the CGL would produce a few frames of an experimental film called ''[[The Works (film)|The Works]]''. After moving to Lucasfilm, the team worked on creating the precursor to [[RenderMan Interface Specification|RenderMan]], called REYES (for "renders everything you ever saw") and developed a number of critical technologies for CG—including [[particle effects]] and various animation tools.

[[John Lasseter]] was hired to the Lucasfilm team for a week in late 1983 with the title "interface designer"; he animated the short film ''[[The Adventures of André &amp; Wally B.]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.fortune.com/2006/05/15/magazines/fortune/pixar_futureof_fortune_052906/index.htm|title=What will Pixar's John Lasseter do at Disney - May. 17, 2006|website=archive.fortune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next few years, a designer suggested naming a new digital compositing computer the "Picture Maker". Smith suggested that the laser-based device have a catchier name, and came up with "Pixer", which after a meeting was changed to "Pixar".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Brian Jay |title=George Lucas: A Life |date=2016 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=New York City |isbn=978-0316257442 |pp=289–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the team began working on special-effects film sequences with [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]]. After years of research, and key milestones such as the Genesis Effect in ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' and the Stained Glass Knight in ''[[Young Sherlock Holmes]]'',&lt;ref name="pixar story"/&gt; the group, which then numbered 40 individuals, was spun out as a corporation in February 1986 by Catmull and Smith. Among the 38 remaining employees, there were also Malcolm Blanchard, David DiFrancesco, [[Ralph Guggenheim]], and Bill Reeves, who had been part of the team since the days of NYIT. [[Tom Duff]], also an NYIT member, would later join Pixar after its formation.&lt;ref name="Pixar Founding Documents"/&gt; With Lucas' 1983 divorce, which coincided with the sudden dropoff in revenues from ''[[Star Wars]]'' licenses following the release of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', they knew he would most likely sell the whole Graphics Group. Worried that the employees would be lost to them if that happened, which would prevent the creation of the first computer-animated movie, they concluded that the best way to keep the team together was to turn the group into an independent company. But [[Moore's Law]] also said that the first film was still some years away, and they needed to focus on a proper product while waiting for computers to become powerful enough. Eventually, they decided they should be a hardware company in the meantime, with their [[Pixar Image Computer]] as the core product, a system primarily sold to government agencies and the scientific and medical community.&lt;ref name="Pixar Founding Documents"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Story Behind Pixar"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alvyray.com/Pixar/PixarMyth3.htm|title=Alvy Pixar Myth 3|publisher=alvyray.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; they also used [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] computers.

In 1983, [[Nolan Bushnell]] founded a new computer-guided animation studio called Kadabrascope as a subsidiary of his [[Chuck E. Cheese's|Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatres]] company (PTT), which was founded in 1977. Only one major project was made out of the new studio, an animated Christmas special for [[NBC]] starring Chuck E. Cheese and other PTT mascots; known as "[https://showbizpizza.com/videos/ptt/promo/index.html Chuck E. Cheese: The Christmas That Almost Wasn't]". The animation movement would be made using [[inbetweening|tweening]] instead of traditional cel animation. After the [[North American Video Game Crash of 1983]], Bushnell started selling some subsidiaries of PTT to keep the business afloat. [[Sente Technologies]] (another division, was founded to have games distributed in PTT stores) was sold to [[Bally Technologies|Bally Games]] and Kadabrascope was sold to Lucasfilm. The Kadabrascope assets were combined with the Computer Division of Lucasfilm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/19841001/136.html|title=When The Magic Goes|magazine=Inc.|date=October 1, 1984|last=Coll|first=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, one of Steve Jobs's first jobs was under Bushnell in 1973 as a technician at his other company [[Atari]], which Bushnell sold to [[Warner Communications]] in 1976 to focus on PTT.&lt;ref name="intoday1"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/india-visit-gave-a-vision-to-steve-jobs/1/154785.html |title=An exclusive interview with Daniel Kottke |magazine=India Today |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=October 27, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506051820/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/india-visit-gave-a-vision-to-steve-jobs/1/154785.html |archivedate=May 6, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; PTT would later go bankrupt in 1985 and be acquired by [[ShowBiz Pizza Place]].

===Independent company===
The newly independent Pixar (1986) was headed by [[Edwin Catmull]] as President and [[Alvy Ray Smith]] as Executive Vice President. While looking for investors, [[Steve Jobs]] showed interest, but initially, Lucas found his offer too low. Yet he eventually accepted after it turned out to be impossible to find other investors. At that point Smith and Catmull had been turned down 45 times; thirty-five venture capitalists and 10 large corporations had declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kieron Johnson |url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/294821 |title=Pixar's Co-Founders Heard 'No' 45 Times Before Steve Jobs Said 'Yes' |publisher=Entrepreneur.com |date=2017-04-28 |accessdate=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs, who had recently been fired from [[Apple Inc.|Apple]],&lt;ref name="Pixar Founding Documents"/&gt; and was now founder and CEO of the new computer company [[NeXT]]. On February 3, 1986, he paid $5&amp;nbsp;million of his own money to George Lucas for technology rights and invested $5&amp;nbsp;million cash as capital into the company, joining the board of directors as chairman.&lt;ref name="Pixar Founding Documents"/&gt;{{Sfn|Paik|2015|p=52}}

In 1985, while still at Lucasfilm, they had made a deal with the Japanese publisher [[Shogakukan]] to make a computer-animated movie called ''Monkey'', based on the [[Sun Wukong|Monkey King]]. The project continued sometime after they became a separate company in 1986, but in the end, it became clear that the technology was simply not there yet. The computers were not powerful enough and the budget would be too high. So it was decided to focus on the computer hardware business some more years while waiting till [[Moore's law]] made a computer-animated feature possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/04/how-pixar-used-moores-law-to-predict-the-future/|title=How Pixar Used Moore's Law to Predict the Future|last=Smith|first=Alvy Ray|date=2013-04-17|work=Wired|access-date=2019-02-13|issn=1059-1028}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pixartouchbook.com/blog/2008/11/22/pixars-film-that-never-was-monkey.html|title=Pixar's film that never was: "Monkey"|last=Price|first=David A.|date=2008-11-22|website=The Pixar Touch|language=en|access-date=2019-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] was interested and eventually bought and used the Pixar Image Computer and custom software written by Pixar as part of their [[Computer Animation Production System]] (CAPS) project, to migrate the laborious ink and paint part of the 2D animation process to a more automated method.

In a bid to drive sales of the system and increase the company's capital, Jobs suggested to make the system available to mainstream users and released the product to the market. Pixar employee John Lasseter, who had long been working on not-for-profit short demonstration animations, such as ''[[Luxo Jr.]]'' (1986) to show off the device's capabilities, premiered his creations at [[SIGGRAPH]], the computer graphics industry's largest convention, to great fanfare.&lt;ref name="ohio"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=http://design.osu.edu/carlson/history/tree/pixar.html|title=Pixar Animation Studios |publisher=[[Ohio State University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Image Computer never sold well.&lt;ref name="ohio" /&gt; Inadequate sales threatened to put the company out of business as financial losses grew. Jobs invested more and more money in exchange for an increased stake in the company, reducing the proportion of management and employee ownership until eventually, his total investment of $50 million gave him control of the entire company. In 1989, Lasseter's growing animation department, originally composed of just four people (Lasseter, [[William Reeves (animator)|Bill Reeves]], [[Eben Fiske Ostby|Eben Ostby]], and [[Samuel J Leffler|Sam Leffler]]), was turned into a division that produced computer-animated commercials for outside companies.&lt;ref name="PixarTimeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pixar.com/companyinfo/faq/faq.htm|title=COMPANY FAQS|publisher=Pixar|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702123318/http://www.pixar.com/companyinfo/faq/faq.htm|archivedate=July 2, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-UHNCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58 |title=To Infinity and Beyond!: The Story of Pixar Animation Studios|first=Karen|last=Paik|date=November 3, 2015|publisher=Chronicle Books|via=Google Books|isbn=9781452147659|page=58|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usask.ca/greenandwhite/issues/2007/winter2007/features/cover_story.php|title=Toy Stories and Other Tales |publisher=[[University of Saskatchewan]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1990, Pixar sold its hardware division, including all proprietary hardware technology and imaging software, to Vicom Systems, and transferred 18 of Pixar's approximately 100 employees. That same year, Pixar moved from [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] to [[Richmond, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Pixar-Animation-Studios-Company-History.html |title=Pixar Animation Studios—Company History |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |accessdate=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pixar released some of its software tools on the open market for Macintosh and Windows systems. [[RenderMan (software)|RenderMan]] was one of the leading 3D packages of the early 1990s, and [[Typestry]] was a special-purpose 3D text renderer that competed with RayDream addDepth.

During this period Pixar continued its successful relationship with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], a studio whose corporate parent would ultimately become its most important partner. As 1991 began, however, the layoff of 30 employees in the company's computer hardware department—including the company's president, Chuck Kolstad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hem.passagen.se/des/hocg/hocg_1990.htm |title=History of Computer Graphics: 1990–99 |publisher=Hem.passagen.se |accessdate=July 8, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418100713/http://hem.passagen.se/des/hocg/hocg_1990.htm|archivedate=April 18, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduced the total number of employees to just 42, essentially its original number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/02/business/hard-times-for-innovator-in-graphics.html |title=Hard Times For Innovator in Graphics |work=The New York Times |date=April 2, 1991 |accessdate=July 8, 2011 |first=Lawrence M. |last=Fisher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Pixar made a historic $26&amp;nbsp;million deal with Disney to produce three computer-animated feature films, the first of which was ''[[Toy Story]]'', a concept which was the product of the technological limitations CGI struggled with at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newsweek.com/toy-story-4-animation-bts-behind-scene-1447615 The Illusion and Emotion Behind 'Toy Story 4' - Newsweek]&lt;/ref&gt; By then the software programmers, who were doing RenderMan and IceMan, and Lasseter's animation department, which made television commercials (and four Luxo Jr. shorts for ''[[Sesame Street]]'' the same year), were all that remained of Pixar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EUx4qErdynIC&amp;pg=PT68 |page=68 |title=Ten Steps Ahead: What Smart Business People Know That You Don't |first=Erik|last=Calonius|date=March 31, 2011|publisher=Headline|via=Google Books|isbn=9780755362363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the total income from these projects the company continued to lose money and Jobs, as chairman of the board and now the full owner, often considered selling it. Even as late as 1994 Jobs contemplated selling Pixar to other companies such as [[Hallmark Cards]], [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]], and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] CEO and co-founder [[Larry Ellison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=David A.|title=The Pixar Touch: The making of a Company|date=2008|publisher=Alfred A.

During the 1990s and 2000s, Pixar gradually developed the "Pixar Braintrust," the studio's primary creative development process, in which all directors, writers, and lead storyboard artists at the studio look at each other's projects on a regular basis and give each other very candid "notes" (the industry term for [[constructive criticism]]).&lt;ref name="Catmull"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Catmull|first1=Ed|title=Inside The Pixar Braintrust|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3027135/lessons-learned/inside-the-pixar-braintrust|accessdate=September 28, 2014|work=Fast Company|publisher=Mansueto Ventures, LLC|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Braintrust operates under a philosophy of a "filmmaker-driven studio," in which creatives help each other move their films forward through a process somewhat like [[peer review]], as opposed to the traditional Hollywood approach of an "executive-driven studio" in which directors are [[Micromanagement|micromanaged]] through "mandatory notes" from development executives ranking above the producers.&lt;ref name="Wloszczyna"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|title='Wreck-It Ralph' is a Disney animation game-changer|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/10/31/wreckitralph-disney-movie-animation/1667373/|accessdate=April 5, 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pond|first=Steve|title=Why Disney Fired John Lasseter—And How He Came Back to Heal the Studio|url=https://www.thewrap.com/john-lasseter-disney-fired-frozen-healed-studio-oscarwrap-down-wire|accessdate=April 5, 2014|newspaper=The Wrap|date=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Catmull, it evolved out of the working relationship between Lasseter, Stanton, Docter, Unkrich, and [[Joe Ranft]] on ''Toy Story''.&lt;ref name="Catmull" /&gt;

As a result of the success of ''Toy Story'', Pixar built a new studio at the Emeryville campus which was designed by PWP Landscape Architecture and opened in November 2000.

===Collaboration with Disney===
Pixar and Disney had disagreements over the production of ''[[Toy Story 2]]''. Originally intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar's three-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production. Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the three-picture agreement, but Disney refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000804&amp;slug=4035397|title=Sequels to 'Toy Story,' 'Tail,' 'Dragonheart' go straight to video. |work=[[The Seattle Times]] | first=John | last=Hartl | date=July 31, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production, while Disney handled [[Film marketing|marketing]] and distribution. Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story, character and sequel rights and also collected a 10- to 15-percent distribution fee. The lack of story, character and sequel rights was perhaps the most onerous aspect to Pixar and set the stage for a contentious relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = James | last = Bjorkman |url= http://animatedfilmreviews.filminspector.com/p/the-golden-age-snow-white-pinochio.html |title = Disney Animated Film Eras |accessdate=June 7, 2014 |publisher = Animated Film Reviews }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two companies attempted to reach a new agreement for ten months before it fell through in January 2004. The new deal would be only for distribution, as Pixar intended to control production and own the resulting story, character and sequel rights themselves while Disney would own the right of first refusal to distribute any sequels. Pixar also wanted to finance their films on their own and collect 100 percent of the profits, paying Disney only the 10- to 15-percent distribution fee.&lt;ref name="Dumps Disney"&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=July 26, 2015|url=http://money.cnn.com/2004/01/29/news/companies/pixar_disney/|title=Pixar dumps Disney |work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=January 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, as part of any distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films already in production under their old agreement, including ''[[The Incredibles]]'' (2004) and ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' (2006). Disney considered these conditions unacceptable, but Pixar would not concede.&lt;ref name="Dumps Disney" /&gt;

Disagreements between [[Steve Jobs]] and then-Disney chairman and CEO [[Michael Eisner]] made the negotiations more difficult than they otherwise might have been. They broke down completely in mid-2004, with Disney forming [[Circle 7 Animation]] and Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2008 |url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2004/01/62104 |title=Pixar Says 'So Long' to Disney |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=January 29, 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502150349/http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/news/2004/01/62104 |archivedate=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this announcement and several talks with [[Warner Bros.]], [[Columbia Pictures]], and [[20th Century Fox]], Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors,&lt;ref name="Grover, Ronald"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm |title=Steve Jobs's Sharp Turn with Cars |author=Grover, Ronald |work=Business Week |date=December 9, 2004 |accessdate=February 23, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311001731/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2004/nf2004129_4222_db035.htm |archivedate=March 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a Warner Bros. spokesperson told [[CNN]], "We would love to be in business with Pixar. They are a great company."&lt;ref name="Dumps Disney"/&gt; After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs for their major releases during the Christmas shopping season. An added benefit of delaying ''Cars'' from November 4, 2005, to June 9, 2006, was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract, to see how things would play out between the two companies.&lt;ref name="Grover, Ronald"/&gt;

Pending the Disney acquisition of Pixar, the two companies created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of ''Ratatouille'', if the acquisition fell through, to ensure that this one film would still be released through Disney's distribution channels. In contrast to the earlier Pixar deal, ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'' was meant to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution fee. The completion of Disney's Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this distribution arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 22, 2008 |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/06/26/pixar_perfectionists_cook_up_ratatouille/ |title=Pixar Perfectionists Cook Up 'Ratatouille' As Latest Animated Concoction |publisher=Star Pulse |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027104117/http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/06/26/pixar_perfectionists_cook_up_ratatouille/ |archivedate=October 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition by Disney===
In 2006, Disney ultimately agreed to buy Pixar for approximately $7.4 billion in an [[Stock swap|all-stock deal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/disney_pixar_deal/ | date=January 24, 2006 |publisher=CNN | title=Disney buys Pixar | first=Paul R. | last=La Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Pixar [[shareholder]] approval, the acquisition was completed January 25, 2006. The transaction catapulted Jobs, who owned 49.65% of total share interest in Pixar, to Disney's largest individual shareholder with 7%, valued at $3.9 billion, and a new seat on its board of directors.&lt;ref name="Walt-Disney-Company-May-2006-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1392/119312506103659/filing-main.htm |title=Walt Disney Company, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date May 8, 2006 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="agrees"&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/25/business/25disney.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=Disney Agrees to Acquire Pixar in a $7.4&amp;nbsp;Billion Deal |work=The New York Times | first=Laura M. | last=Holson | date=January 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs's new Disney holdings exceeded holdings belonging to ex-CEO [[Michael Eisner]], the previous top shareholder, who still held 1.7%; and Disney Director Emeritus [[Roy E. Disney]], who held almost 1% of the corporation's shares. Pixar shareholders received 2.3 shares of Disney common stock for each share of Pixar common stock redeemed.

As part of the deal, John Lasseter, by then Executive Vice President, became [[Creative director|Chief Creative Officer]] (reporting directly to President and CEO [[Robert Iger]] and consulting with Disney Director Roy E. Disney) of both Pixar and [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] (including its division [[DisneyToon Studios]]), as well as the Principal Creative Adviser at [[Walt Disney Imagineering]], which designs and builds the company's [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme parks]].&lt;ref name="agrees" /&gt; Catmull retained his position as President of Pixar, while also becoming President of Walt Disney Animation Studios, reporting to Iger and [[Dick Cook]], chairman of the [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]. Jobs's position as Pixar's chairman and chief executive officer was abolished, and instead, he took a place on the Disney board of directors.&lt;ref name="buys pixar"&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/24/news/companies/disney_pixar_deal/|title=Disney buys Pixar |publisher=CNN | date=January 24, 2006 | first=Paul R. | last=La Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the deal closed in January 2006, Lasseter revealed that Iger had realized Disney needed to buy Pixar while watching a parade at the opening of [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] in September 2005.&lt;ref name="Schlender"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schlender|first=Brent|title=Pixar's magic man|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/15/magazines/fortune/pixar_futureof_fortune_052906/index.htm|accessdate=April 20, 2012|publisher=CNN|date=May 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iger noticed that of all the Disney characters in the parade, not one was a character that Disney had created within the last ten years since all the newer ones had been created by Pixar.&lt;ref name="Schlender" /&gt; Upon returning to Burbank, Iger commissioned a financial analysis that confirmed that Disney had actually lost money on animation for the past decade, then presented that information to the board of directors at his first board meeting after being promoted from COO to CEO, and the board, in turn, authorized him to explore the possibility of a deal with Pixar.&lt;ref name="Issacson1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Issacson|first1=Walter|title=Steve Jobs|date=2013|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9781451648546|page=[https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/439 439]|edition=1st paperback|url=https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/439}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasseter and Catmull were wary when the topic of Disney buying Pixar first came up, but Jobs asked them to give Iger a chance (based on his own experience negotiating with Iger in summer 2005 for the rights to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] shows for the fifth-generation [[iPod Classic]]),&lt;ref name="Issacson2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Issacson|first1=Walter|title=Steve Jobs|date=2013|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9781451648546|page=[https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/438 438]|edition=1st paperback|url=https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/438}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in turn, Iger convinced them of the sincerity of his epiphany that Disney really needed to re-focus on animation.&lt;ref name="Schlender" /&gt;

Lasseter and Catmull's oversight of both the Disney Animation and Pixar studios did not mean that the two studios were merging, however. In fact, additional conditions were laid out as part of the deal to ensure that Pixar remained a separate [[Legal entity|entity]], a concern that analysts had expressed about the Disney deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001039/000119312506012082/dex21.htm

Also, the Pixar name was guaranteed to continue, and the studio would remain in its current [[Emeryville, California]], location with the "Pixar" sign. Finally, branding of films made post-merger would be "Disney•Pixar" (beginning with ''Cars'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=April 22, 2008|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=OKTB&amp;p_theme=oktb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=10F4A5FB9BD5E290&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title= Sale unlikely to change Pixar culture |publisher=Inside Bay Area | first1=Matthew | last1=Bunk | date=January 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jim Morris (film producer)|Jim Morris]], producer of ''[[WALL-E]]'' (2008), became general manager of Pixar.

After a few years, Lasseter and Catmull were able to successfully transfer the basic principles of the Pixar Braintrust to Disney Animation, although meetings of the Disney Story Trust are reportedly "more polite" than those of the Pixar Braintrust.&lt;ref name=THRPixarVSDisney&gt;{{cite news|last=Kilday|first=Gregg|title=Pixar vs. Disney Animation: John Lasseter's Tricky Tug-of-War|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/pixar-disney-animation-john-lasseters-661752|accessdate=December 4, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catmull later explained that after the merger, to maintain the studios' separate identities and cultures (notwithstanding the fact of common ownership and common senior management), he and Lasseter "drew a hard line" that each studio was solely responsible for its own projects and would not be allowed to borrow personnel from or lend tasks out to the other.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bell|first=Chris| title=Pixar's Ed Catmull: interview|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/pixar/10719241/Pixars-Ed-Catmull-interview.html|accessdate=April 5, 2014|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zahed"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zahed|first=Ramin|title=An Interview with Disney/Pixar President Dr. Ed Catmull|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/people/an-interview-with-disneypixar-president-dr-ed-catmull/|accessdate=April 5, 2014|newspaper=Animation Magazine|date=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That rule ensures that each studio maintains "local ownership" of projects and can be proud of its own work.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zahed" /&gt; Thus, for example, when Pixar had issues with ''Ratatouille'' and Disney Animation had issues with ''[[Bolt (2008 film)|Bolt]]'' (2008), "nobody bailed them out" and each studio was required "to solve the problem on its own" even when they knew there were personnel at the other studio who theoretically could have helped.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zahed" /&gt;

In November 2014, Morris was promoted to president of Pixar, while his counterpart at Disney Animation, general manager Andrew Millstein, was also promoted to president of that studio.&lt;ref name="Graser"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graser|first1=Marc|title=Walt Disney Animation, Pixar Promote Andrew Millstein, Jim Morris to President|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/walt-disney-animation-pixar-promote-andrew-millstein-jim-morris-to-president-1201359728/|accessdate=November 18, 2014|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=November 18, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121224901/http://variety.com/2014/film/news/walt-disney-animation-pixar-promote-andrew-millstein-jim-morris-to-president-1201359728|archivedate=November 21, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both continue to report to Catmull, who retains the title of president of both Disney Animation and Pixar.&lt;ref name="Graser" /&gt;

When [[Steve Jobs]], chief executive officer of Apple Inc. and Pixar, and [[John Lasseter]], then-executive vice president of Pixar, decided to move their studios from a leased space in [[Point Richmond, California]], to larger quarters of their own, they chose a 20-[[acre]] site in [[Emeryville, California]],&lt;ref name="SF Chronical"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pimentel|first1=Benjamin|title=Lucasfilm Unit Looking at Move To Richmond / Pixar shifting to Emeryville|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Lucasfilm-Unit-Looking-at-Move-To-Richmond-3303584.php|website=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202093818/http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Lucasfilm-Unit-Looking-at-Move-To-Richmond-3303584.php|archivedate=February 2, 2015|url-status=live|date=August 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly occupied by [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte Foods, Inc.]] The first building of several, a high-tech structure designed by [[Bohlin Cywinski Jackson]],&lt;ref name=BCJ&gt;{{cite web|title=Bohlin Cywinski Jackson {{!}} Pixar Animation Studios|url=http://bcj.com/projects/pixar-animation-studios/|website=[[Bohlin Cywinski Jackson]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140830063201/http://bcj.com/projects/pixar-animation-studios|archivedate=August 30, 2014|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; has special [[Building foundation|foundations]] and [[electricity generation|generators]] to ensure continued film production, even through major [[Earthquake|earthquakes]].

===Traditions===
While some of Pixar's first animators were former [[Traditional animation|cel animators]] including John Lasseter, they also came from [[computer animation]] or were fresh college graduates.&lt;ref name="pixar story"/&gt; A large number of animators that make up the animation department at Pixar were hired around the time the studio released ''[[A Bug's Life]]'' (1998), ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' (2001) and ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003). Although ''[[Toy Story]]'' was a successful film, it was Pixar's first feature film at the time, becoming the first major computer-animation studio to successfully produce theatrical feature films. The majority of the animation industry was (and still is) located in Los Angeles while Pixar is located {{convert|350|mi}} north in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Also, traditional hand-drawn animation was still the dominant medium for feature animated films.

With the scarcity of Los Angeles-based animators willing to move their families so far north to give up traditional animation and try computer animation, Pixar's new hires at this time either came directly from college or had worked outside feature animation. For those who had traditional animation skills, the Pixar animation software [[Marionette (software)|Marionette]] was designed so that traditional animators would require a minimum amount of training before becoming productive.&lt;ref name="pixar story"/&gt;

In an interview with [[PBS]] talk show host [[Tavis Smiley]],&lt;ref name="Tavis"&gt;{{cite web|author=Smiley, Tavis |title=Tavis Smiley |date=January 24, 2007 |publisher=[[PBS]] |url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200701/20070124_transcript.html |accessdate=March 1, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124074654/http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200701/20070124_transcript.html |archivedate=November 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasseter said that Pixar's films follow the same theme of self-improvement as the company itself has: with the help of friends or family, a character ventures out into the real world and learns to appreciate his friends and family. At the core, Lasseter said, "it's gotta be about the growth of the main character and how he changes."&lt;ref name="Tavis"/&gt;

{{As of|2019}}, every Pixar feature film has included a character voiced by [[John Ratzenberger]], who had famously starred in the TV show ''[[Cheers]]''. Pixar paid tribute to their "good luck charm" in the end credits of ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' (2006) by parodying scenes from three of their earlier films, replacing all of the characters with motor vehicles. After the third scene, Mack (his character in ''Cars'') realizes that the same actor has been voicing characters in every film.

Due to the traditions that have occurred within the film such as [[anthropomorphic]] animals and [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] crossovers between films that have been spotted by Pixar fans, a blog post entitled ''The Pixar Theory'' was published in 2013 by Jon Negroni proposing that all of the characters within the Pixar universe were related.&lt;ref name=Dunn&gt;{{cite news|last=Dunn|first=Gaby|title="Pixar Theory" connects all your favorite movies in 1 universe|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/pixar-theory-jon-negroni-up-brave-ratatouille/|accessdate=July 13, 2013|newspaper=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whitney&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitney|first=Erin|title=The (Mind-Blowing) Pixar Theory: Are All the Films Connected?|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2013/07/12/the-pixar-theory-are-all-the-films-connected/|accessdate=July 13, 2013|newspaper=[[Moviefone]]|date=July 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715193855/http://news.moviefone.com/2013/07/12/the-pixar-theory-are-all-the-films-connected/|archive-date=July 15, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McFarland&gt;{{cite news|last=McFarland|first=Kevin|title=Read This: A grand unified theory connects all Pixar films in one timeline|url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/read-this-a-grand-unified-theory-connecting-all-pi,100084/|accessdate=July 13, 2013|newspaper=[[The A.V.

===Sequels and prequels===
''[[Toy Story 2]]'' was originally commissioned by Disney as a 60-minute [[direct-to-video]] film. Expressing doubts about the strength of the material, John Lasseter convinced the Pixar team to start from scratch and make the sequel their third full-length feature film.

Following the release of ''Toy Story 2'' in 1999, Pixar and Disney had a [[gentlemen's agreement]] that Disney would not make any sequels without Pixar's involvement despite their own right to do so. After the two companies were unable to agree on a new deal, Disney announced in 2004 they would plan to move forward on sequels with/without Pixar and put ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' into pre-production at Disney's then-new CGI division [[Circle 7 Animation]]. However, when Lasseter was placed in charge of all Disney and Pixar animation following Disney's acquisition of Pixar in 2006, he put all sequels on hold and ''Toy Story 3'' was canceled. In May 2006, it was announced that ''Toy Story 3'' was back in pre-production with a new plot and under Pixar's control. The film was released on June 18, 2010, as Pixar's eleventh feature film.

Shortly after announcing the resurrection of ''Toy Story 3'', Lasseter fueled speculation on further sequels by saying, "If we have a great story, we'll do a sequel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Douglas, Edwards|title=Pixar Mastermind John Lasseter|date=June 3, 2006|publisher=comingsoon.net|url= https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=14741|accessdate =March 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cars 2]]'', Pixar's first non-''Toy Story'' sequel, was officially announced in April 2008 and released on June 24, 2011 as their twelfth. ''[[Monsters University]]'', a prequel to ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' (2001), was announced in April 2010 and initially set for release in November 2012;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8639142.stm|title=Disney announce Monsters Inc sequel|date=April 23, 2010|work=BBC News |accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the release date was pushed to June 21, 2013 due to Pixar's past success with summer releases, according to a Disney executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/monsters-university-pushed-to-2013 | title=Monsters University Pushed to 2013 | accessdate=April 4, 2011 | date=April 4, 2011 |publisher=movieweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, [[Tom Hanks]], who voiced [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]] in the [[Toy Story (franchise)|''Toy Story'' series]], implied that ''[[Toy Story 4]]'' was "in the works," although it had not yet been confirmed by the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a327023/pixar-making-toy-story-4-says-tom-hanks.html | title=Tom Hanks reveals Toy Story 4 | date =June 27, 2011 | accessdate=June 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesshollywood.com/tom-hanks-confirms-toy-story-4-in-the-works_article_49928 Access Hollywood] June 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2013, ''[[Finding Dory]]'', a sequel to ''[[Finding Nemo]]'', was announced for a June 17, 2016 release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keegan|first=Rebecca|title='The Good Dinosaur' moved to 2015, leaving Pixar with no 2014 film|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-pixar-good-dinosaur-pushed-to-2015-20130918,0,1607398.story|accessdate=September 18, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, ''[[Incredibles 2]]'' and ''[[Cars 3]]'' were announced as films in development.&lt;ref name="Incredibles2Cars3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/18/disney-officially-announces-the-incredibles-2-and-cars-3-are-in-the-works|title=Disney Officially Announces The Incredibles 2 and Cars 3 Are in the Works|last=Vejvoda|first=Jim|website=IGN|date=March 18, 2014|accessdate=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, ''Toy Story 4'' was confirmed to be in development with Lasseter serving as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/john-lasseter-direct-fourth-toy-747226 | title=John Lasseter to Direct Fourth 'Toy Story' Film | last=Ford | first=Rebecca | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=November 6, 2014 | accessdate=November 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in July 2017, Lasseter announced that he had stepped down, leaving [[Josh Cooley]] as sole director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/toy-story-4-new-director-josh-cooley-john-lasseter-steps-down-1202496456/|last=Khatchatourian|first=Maane|title='Toy Story 4': Josh Cooley Becomes Sole Director as John Lasseter Steps Down|magazine=Variety|date=July 14, 2017|accessdate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released in June 2019, ''Toy Story 4'' ranks among the 40 top-grossing films in [[American cinema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Box Office: 'Toy Story 4' Among 40 Top-Grossing Movies Ever |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2019/07/24/us-box-office-toy-story-4-among-40-top-grossing-movies-ever/#3a69fcc643ad |accessdate=24 July 2019 |work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptation to television===
''Toy Story'' was the first Pixar film to be adapted for television as [[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins|''Buzz Lightyear of Star Command'' film]] and [[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command|TV series]]. ''Cars'' became the second with the help of ''[[Cars Toons]]'', a series of 3-to-5-minute short films running between regular [[Disney Channel]] shows and featuring [[Mater (Cars)|Mater]] (a tow truck voiced by comedian [[Larry the Cable Guy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Cars Toons Coming in October To Disney Channel |publisher=AnimationWorldNetwork |date= September 26, 2008 |url=http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&amp;newsitem_no=24887 |accessdate=December 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2013 and 2014, Pixar released its first two television specials, ''[[Toy Story of Terror!]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cheney|first=Alexandra|title=Watch A Clip from Pixar's First TV Special 'Toy Story OF TERROR!'|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/10/14/watch-an-exclusive-clip-from-pixars-toy-story-of-terror/|accessdate=February 24, 2014|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Toy Story That Time Forgot]]''.

===Animation and live-action===
All Pixar films and shorts to date have been computer-animated features, but so far, ''[[WALL-E]]'' (2008) has been the only Pixar film not to be completely animated as it featured a small amount of live-action footage while ''[[Day &amp; Night (2010 film)|Day &amp; Night]]'' (2010) and ''[[Kitbull]]'' (2019) are the only shorts to feature 2D animation. ''[[1906 (novel)#Cancelled film adaptation|1906]]'', the live-action film by [[Brad Bird]] based on a screenplay and novel by James Dalessandro about the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]], was in development but has since been abandoned by Bird and Pixar. Bird has stated that he was "interested in moving into the live-action realm with some projects" while "staying at Pixar [because] it's a very comfortable environment for me to work in". In June 2018, Bird mentioned the possibility of adapting the novel as a TV series, and the earthquake sequence as a live-action feature film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collider.com/1906-update-brad-bird/|title=Brad Bird Says '1906' May Get Made as an "Amalgam" of a TV and Film Project|date=June 18, 2018|accessdate=June 18, 2018|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|author=Adam Chitwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Toy Story Toons'' short ''[[Hawaiian Vacation]]'' (2011) also includes the fish and shark as live-action.

Jim Morris, president of Pixar, produced [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s ''[[John Carter (film)|John Carter]]'' (2012) which [[Andrew Stanton]] co-wrote and directed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jagernauth|first1=Kevin|title='John Carter' Producer Jim Morris Confirms Sequel 'John Carter: The Gods Of Mars' Already In The Works|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/john-carter-producer-jim-morris-confirms-sequel-john-carter-the-gods-of-mars-already-in-the-works|accessdate=January 22, 2015|work=The Playlist|publisher=Indiewire.com|date=February 16, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122190529/http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/john-carter-producer-jim-morris-confirms-sequel-john-carter-the-gods-of-mars-already-in-the-works|archive-date=January 22, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
