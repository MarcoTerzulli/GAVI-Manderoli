== Early life and education ==
Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu was born in [[Accra|Accra, Ghana]], to [[Ga-Adangbe people|Ga]] parents. Ollennu's father, Trebi Ollennu was an economist at the Ministry of Finance in Accra. As a child, Ashitey lived close to an airport and would always see airplanes fly by. This fascinated him and caused his interest in [[space exploration]], [[aircraft]] and [[Aerobot|aerial robots]], particularly [[autopilot]]s.  He read a lot on the "[[Glass cockpit|Glass Cockpit]]" system for both military and civil airplanes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He completed his secondary education at the [[Ghana Secondary Technical School]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He travelled to the United Kingdom where he received his Bachelors in Engineering (BEng) in [[Avionics]] at the [[Queen Mary University of London|Queen Mary, University of London]] in 1991, with a thesis on ''"Review of 4-D guidance techniques and the simulation of 4-D aircraft guidance"''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Between 1993 and 1996, he pursued his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Control engineering|Control Systems Engineering]] at the School of Engineering and Applied Science, [[Royal Military College of Science]], [[Cranfield University]] in the UK where he wrote his dissertation titled ''"Robust Non-linear Control Designs Using Adaptive Fuzzy Systems.''"&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Ashitey_Trebi-Ollennu/|title=JPL Robotics: People: Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu|website=www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov|access-date=29 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212013204/http://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Ashitey_Trebi-Ollennu/|archive-date=12 February 2017|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also holds a [[Project Management Professional|project management certification]] from the [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], earned in 2007.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Career ==
He joined the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1999 and rose through the ranks to become the leader of the team that designed the [[Mars rover|Mars Rover]] robot that landed on the red planet. Over the years, his responsibilities have involved flight projects, flight projects review boards, mission formulation, technology tasks, technical writing and proposals. He also served as a reviewer for NASA Science Mission Directorate technology proposals and NASA Office of Education proposals.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; Other engagements at NASA are 2003 – [[Mars Exploration Rover]], 2007 – Phoenix Mars Lander and Mars Science Laboratory which is scheduled for launch in 2011 and will be NASA's third generation of rover to explore Mars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Among his roles at the In Sight Mars Mission were Product Delivery Manager and Chief for the Instrument Deployment System, a technical group lead in the Robotic Manipulation &amp; Sampling group at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, where he has been since 1999. His technical research interests include on planetary rovers and its operations, system of systems, manipulation, multiple mobile robots (planetary outpost), [[mechatronics]], reconfigurable robots, audjustable autonomy and man-machine interaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Closely linked to these are various areas in robotics sysems and engineering: Space Robotics Systems, Flight Systems Integration &amp; Test, Planetary Rover Operations, System of Systems Design, Distributed Mobile Robotics, System Architectures, Dynamic Modeling, Control Systems design for Aerospace and Mechatronics Systems and Contract Technical Management.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He has more than 95 publications to his credit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He was a Research Scholar at the Institute for Complex Engineered Systems at the [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]] where he was instrumental in the design and implementation of a system of [[All-terrain vehicle|All Terrain Vehicles]] (ATVs) for distributed tactical surveillance for the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agenc]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;y (DARPA).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In an interview with the [[BBC]], Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu noted that he had started a project in his home country of Ghana to make Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) more likable and fun. He worked on the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)]] that found water on Mars. The [[InSight]] mission successfully landed on the red planet on Monday 26 November 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02h3hlt#|title=BBC World Service – Exchanges at the Frontier, Exchanges at the Frontier, Robotics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150126054153/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02h3hlt#|archive-date=26 January 2015|url-status=live|access-date=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Edward Balami|title=DR ASHITEY TREBI OLLENNU OF NASA ON STEM|date=13 October 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHjdywy1zJI|access-date=29 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129205222/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHjdywy1zJI|archive-date=29 November 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wellcome Collection|title=NASA's InSight mission to Mars {{!}} Ashitey Trebi-Ollennu|date=15 January 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClVXlxV3jjo|access-date=29 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129205222/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClVXlxV3jjo|archive-date=29 November 2018|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per the [[The New York Times|New York Times]], the spacecraft is expected to study the Mars' underworld, listening for [[marsquake]]s and seeking clues about the dusty world's formation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2011 Ashitey founded the Ghana Robotics Academy Foundation (GRAF), a nonprofit volunteer organization dedicated to motivating and inspiring young Ghanaians in science, technology and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://foundation.ghanarobotics.org/#|title=Ghana Robotics Academy Foundation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514122236/http://foundation.ghanarobotics.org/#|archive-date=14 May 2016|url-status=live|access-date=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His foundation won the [[Google]] RISE Award 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Commenting on his job, he noted ''"The brilliant thing about my job is that, it is not a circumscribed routine, there are different challenges everyday. Believe me, it is a lot of fun. NASA is also a great organization that cares about its people and their personal development, need I say more?”''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
