It was announced on October 4, 2011 at Apple's Cupertino campus, and was the final Apple product announced in the lifetime of former Apple [[CEO]] and co-founder [[Steve Jobs]], who [[Death of Steve Jobs|died]] the following day.&lt;ref name="verge iP4S announcement"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/apple/2011/10/4/2470139/iphone-4s-announced-available-october-14th-starting-at-199|title=iPhone 4S announced, available October 14th starting at $199|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|first=Chris|last=Ziegler|date=October 4, 2011|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orders could be placed on October 7, 2011 and mainstream availability in retail stores began on October 14, 2011 in the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Japan]]. Sales peaked over its predecessor with more than a million sales in the first twenty-four hours of order availability and more than four million sales in the first four days of retail availability. Further worldwide rollout, including 22 additional countries on October 28, came over the next several months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/10/04Apple-Launches-iPhone-4S-iOS-5-iCloud.html |title=Apple Launches iPhone 4S, iOS 5 &amp; iCloud |accessdate=October 23, 2011 |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This iPhone was named "4S" where "S" stood for [[Siri]]{{efn|Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] confirmed that the S stood for Siri during the Q&amp;A session at the D10 conference in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultofmac.com/170338/tim-cook-explains-how-apple-names-its-products-iphone-4s-stands-for-siri/ Tim Cook Explains How Apple Names Its Products, iPhone 4S Stands For “Siri”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redmondpie.com/tim-cook-confirms-that-the-s-in-iphone-4s-stands-for-siri/ Tim Cook Confirms That The ‘S’ In iPhone 4S Stands For Siri]&lt;/ref&gt;}} an iPhone 4S-exclusive [[intelligent personal assistant]] that was later included in future generations of mobile Apple products. Retaining most of the external design of the iPhone 4, the 4S hosted major internal upgrades, including an upgrade to the [[Apple A5]] chipset, and an 8-megapixel camera with [[1080p]] video recording. It debuted with [[iOS 5]], the fifth major version of [[iOS]], Apple's mobile operating system, that introduced features including [[iCloud]], [[iMessage]], [[Notification Center]], [[Reminders]], and [[Twitter]] integration.

Reception to the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} was generally favorable. Reviewers noted Siri, the new camera, and processing speeds as significant advantages over the prior model.&lt;ref name="vergejoshua" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="engadgetreviewtim" /&gt; It was succeeded by the [[iPhone 5]] as Apple's flagship phone on September 12, 2012. The iPhone 4S remained on sale, albeit being sold with reduced storage (from 16/32/64&amp;nbsp;GB down to 8&amp;nbsp;GB). The 4S was officially discontinued on September 9, 2014 following the announcement of the [[iPhone 6]], although production did continue for developing markets until February 17, 2016. During the course of its lifetime, the iPhone 4S was one of the best-selling iPhones ever produced and it is the first iPhone to support five major versions of iOS: [[iOS 5]], [[iOS 6]], [[iOS 7]], [[iOS 8]], and [[iOS 9]] (the [[iPad 2]] was supported from [[iOS 4]] to [[iOS 9]]). The 4S is also the last iPhone to have the original 30 pin connector as the succeeding [[iPhone 5]] replaced it with the all digital [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning Connector]].

==Origin==
[[File:Apple Headquarters in Cupertino.jpg|thumb|left|The "Let's Talk iPhone" event was held at the [[Apple Campus]], instead of the [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]], where most non-[[WWDC]] events are held.]]
As early as May 2011, some leaks had a fairly accurate description of the iPhone 4S including the name "{{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}", the [[Apple A5]] chip, HSDPA,&lt;ref name="apple"&gt;{{cite web |title=iPhone 4S - Technical Specifications |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |date=October 14, 2011 |url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html |accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; new camera, and [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] carrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43050201 |title=Rumors: Next iPhone called 4S, won't have 4G |last=Rothman |first=Wilson |date=May 16, 2011 |work=NBC News |accessdate=October 6, 2018 |publisher=[[NBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} was unveiled at Apple's "Let's Talk iPhone" event on October 4, 2011, on the [[Apple Campus]] in [[Cupertino, California]].&lt;ref name="sgkeynote"&gt;{{cite news |last=Davies |first=Chris |title=Apple "Let's Talk iPhone" event confirmed for October 4 |publisher=SlashGear |date=September 27, 2011 |url=http://www.slashgear.com/apple-lets-talk-iphone-event-confirmed-for-october-4-27183125/ |accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The keynote was the first which [[Tim Cook]] gave since the Verizon keynote earlier in the year. It was also Cook's first launch without Apple co-founder [[Steve Jobs]], whose health was deteriorating, and he died the day after the announcement of the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}. Tim Carmody of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' praised Cook for focusing on company achievements, calling him a "global business thinker" and a "taskmaster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carmody |first=Tim |title=Less Flash, More World Domination: Apple's Tim Cook Era Begins |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]] |date=October 5, 2011 |url=https://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/10/keynote-tim-cook/ |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the "Let's Talk iPhone" event held by Apple on October 4, 2011, [[Mike Capps (executive)|Mike Capps]] demonstrated Epic Games' ''[[Infinity Blade II]]'', the sequel to ''[[Infinity Blade]]'', on an {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}. Capps boasted that the game uses Epic Games' [[Unreal Engine 3]] and features the same graphic techniques used in the [[Xbox 360]] game ''[[Gears of War 3]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stein |first=Scott |title=How Apple's new iPhone 4S changes gaming |publisher=[[CNET]] |date=October 4, 2011 |url= http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-20115380-233/how-apples-new-iphone-4s-changes-gaming/ |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation about Apple's next generation phone, including various specifications and a predicted name "iPhone 5", had been widespread in the time preceding its debut.&lt;ref name=vangrove&gt;{{cite news |last=Grove |first=Jennifer Van |title=iPhone 4S: 4 Reasons to Upgrade |publisher=[[Mashable]] |date=October 4, 2011 |url=http://mashable.com/2011/10/04/iphone-4s-upgrade/ |accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} was announced, it was considered by some media to be a disappointment, due to the expected release of an iPhone 5.&lt;ref name="vangrove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BI iP4S disappointment"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jay |last=Yarow |title=iPhone 4S: Big Disappointment, Will Still Be The World's Best Selling Phone |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |date=October 4, 2011 |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-4s-disappointment-2011-10 |accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no external differences between the iPhone 4 [[CDMA]] model and the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}, with the exception of a [[Subscriber identity module|SIM card]] slot on the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}.&lt;ref name="vangrove" /&gt; All changes were internal (slight external differences between the iPhone 4 [[GSM]] model and the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} exist, as said differences existed between the CDMA and GSM models of the iPhone 4).&lt;ref name="gizmodo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tnw"&gt;{{cite news |last=Panzarino |first=Matthew |title=Apple announces iPhone 4S: Same design, GSM/CDMA, A5 chip, 7x faster graphics, 8MP, 1080p Video |publisher=The Next Web |date=October 4, 2011 |url= https://thenextweb.com/apple/2011/10/04/apple-announces-the-iphone-4s-with-same-design-a5-chip-7x-faster-graphics/ |accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2013, the iPhone 4S name was re-stylised as iPhone 4s, using a lower case 's' to reflect the names of the newly announced [[iPhone 5S|iPhone 5s]] and [[iPhone 5C|iPhone 5c]]. This was unusual for Apple as an upper case 'S' had been used since the introduction of the [[iPhone 3GS]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=iPhone 5s And 5c: Yes, Those Are Lower-Case &amp;#124; Lifehacker Australia |publisher=Lifehacker.com.au |date=September 2013 |url=http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/09/iphone-5s-and-5c-yes-those-are-lower-case/ |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 2016, following the release of [[iOS 10]], Apple dropped support for the iPhone 4S, making iOS 9 the last major iOS version available for the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://arstechnica.com/apple/2016/06/goodbye-a5-ios-10-ends-support-for-iphone-4s-ipad-2-and-more/ |title=iOS 10 ends support for iPhone 4S, iPad 2, and more |date=June 13, 2016 |accessdate=June 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the first iPhone that does not need to connect to iTunes in order to be activated because iOS 5 introduces features like iCloud.]]
The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}, like other iPhones, runs [[iOS]], Apple's [[mobile operating system]].&lt;ref name="iosapple"&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple – iOS 5 – 200+ new features for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=https://www.apple.com/ios/ |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[user interface]] of iOS is based on the concept of [[direct manipulation]], using [[multi-touch gestures]]. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. The response to user input is immediate and provides a fluid interface.&lt;ref name="iphone4smanual"&gt;{{cite web |title=iPhone User Guide |format=PDF |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |date=May 7, 2012 |url=http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iphone_user_guide.pdf |accessdate=May 20, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308105745/http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iPhone_User_Guide.pdf |archive-date=March 8, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as ''swipe'', ''tap'', ''pinch'', and ''reverse pinch'', all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal [[accelerometer]]s are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it in three dimensions (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode).&lt;ref name="iphone4smanual"/&gt;

The iPhone 4S was first shipped with iOS 5, which was released on October 12, 2011, 2 days before the release of the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Beavis |first=Gareth |title=iPhone 4S review - Interface |publisher=[[TechRadar]] |date=December 8, 2011 |url= http://www.techradar.com/au/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/iphone-4s-1031754/review/2#articleContent |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 4S uses iOS 5.1.1, which was released on May 7, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=iOS 5.1.1 Software Update |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |date=May 7, 2012 |url=http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1521 |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME Apple Announces iOS 5.1, iPhoto App, and Updates to GarageBand and iMovie Apps"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wagstaff |first=Keith |title=Apple Announces iOS 5.1, iPhoto App, and Updates to GarageBand and iMovie Apps |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 7, 2012 |url= http://techland.time.com/2012/03/07/apple-announces-ios-5-1-updates-to-iphoto-garageband-and-imovie/ |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2015, the device can be updated to [[iOS 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=iOS 9 - What's New |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |date=September 19, 2012 |url=https://www.apple.com/ios/whats-new/ |accessdate=September 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can act as a [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|hotspot]], sharing its internet connection over WiFi, Bluetooth, or USB,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|title=The new iPad: It's a Breakthrough because it features are. |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |date=March 7, 2012 |url=https://www.apple.com/ipad/features/ |access-date=March 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316162215/http://www.apple.com/ipad/features/ |archive-date=March 16, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also accesses the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], a digital [[application software|application]] [[digital distribution|distribution]] platform for iOS developed and maintained by Apple. The service allows users to browse and download [[mobile apps|applications]] from the [[iTunes Store]] that were developed with [[Xcode]] and the [[iOS SDK]] and were published through Apple.

The iPhone 4S can play music, movies, television shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and [[podcast]]s and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, [[playlist]]s, [[genre]]s, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and [[Compilation album|compilations]]. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes.&lt;ref name="music4s"&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple - iPhone 4S - Hear your favorite music everywhere you go. |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |date=October 11, 2011 |url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/built-in-apps/music.html |accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPhone 4S uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection. Users can rotate their device horizontally to [[Page orientation|landscape mode]] to access [[Cover Flow]]. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the 4S, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a [[Genius (iTunes)|Genius playlist]].&lt;ref name="music4s"/&gt;

The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} introduced a new automated voice control system called [[Siri]],&lt;ref name="gizmodo" /&gt; that allows the user to give the iPhone commands, which it can execute and respond to. For example, iPhone commands such as "What is the weather going to be like?" will generate a response such as "The weather is to be cloudy and rainy and drop to 54&amp;nbsp;degrees today." These commands can vary greatly and control almost every application of the phone. The commands given do not have to be specific and can be used with [[natural language processing|natural language]]. Siri can be accessed by holding down the home button for a short amount of time (compared to using the regular function). An impact of Siri, as shown by Apple video messages, is that it is much easier for people to use device functions while driving, exercising, or when they have their hands full.&lt;ref name="vangrove" /&gt; It also means people with trouble reading, seeing, or typing can access the phone more easily.&lt;ref name="vangrove" /&gt;

On the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}, [[texting]] can be aided by the voice assistant, which allows speech-to-text.&lt;ref name="vangrove" /&gt; In addition to regular texting, messaging on the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} is supported by [[iMessage]], a specialized instant messaging program and service that allows unlimited texting to other Apple iOS 5 products. This supports the inclusion of media in text messages, integration with the device's voice-controlled software assistant, and read receipts for sent messages. Input to the computer comes from a keyboard displayed on the multi-touch screen or by voice-to-text by speaking into the microphone. Entered text is supported by predictive and suggestion software as well as a spell-checker, that includes many regional dialects like Swiss spoken French.&lt;ref name="4S" /&gt;

At the announcement, plans were in place for the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} to support many languages. Different features have different language requirements, such as keyboards compared to the word predictor and spell-checker, which needs a large dictionary of words. Language support is related to the iOS 5 operating system that the device launched with, although not always. The Siri digital assistant supported French, English, and German at launch.&lt;ref name="vergejoshua"/&gt; Since it uses a software-based keyboard supported by the multi-touch display, it can support many different [[keyboard layout]]s without having to change physically. The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} can display different languages and scripts at the same time.&lt;ref name="chaffin" /&gt;

On September 19, 2012, iOS 6 was released to the iPhone 4S among other compatible iOS device as an over the air (OTA) upgrade package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tam |first=Donna |title=Apple's iOS 6 release date: Start your downloads on Sept. 19 |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |work=[[CNET]] |date=September 12, 2012 |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57510600-37/apples-ios-6-release-date-start-your-downloads-on-sept-19/ |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Apple the update contains 200 new features and tweaks, which includes a new maps app, dubbed [[Apple Maps]], [[Facebook]] integration and Passbook, an application that allows users to store their coupons, boarding passes and tickets digitally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gunther |first=Cory |title=What’s new in iOS 6?

Although the device has improved performance over iOS 7, some newer features that were released to newer models such as AirDrop and CarPlay were not supported. The iPhone 4S can also run iOS 8, which was released on September 17, 2014. Given that the device was supported for more than 3 years, some newer features of the software such as Apple Pay were not supported. It is also unable to work with Apple Watch due to the relatively aged hardware. In fact, some users often reported that performance on the 4S is very slow, similar to how iOS 7 ran on the iPhone 4, and suggesting that they should not upgrade due to battery draining issues and hanging up on calls. Meanwhile, Apple released iOS 8.1.1, which brought slight improvements to the phone and the [[iPad 2]], but it still did not run as fast as newer models.

===iOS 9 controversy===
On June 8, 2015, Apple announced at the [[WWDC]] that the iPhone 4S would support [[iOS 9]]. This makes it the first iPhone to support 5 major versions of iOS, and the second iOS device to support 5 major versions (iOS 9 will support the iPad 2 as well, bringing its total up to six major versions of iOS supported). On December 22, 2015, Apple faced a class action lawsuit for crippling the iPhone 4S with the iOS 9 update with slow and buggy software or to pay hundreds of dollars on a new iPhone.

On June 13, 2016, Apple announced that the iPhone 4S would not support [[iOS 10]] due to hardware limitations.

It was briefly possible to downgrade the iPhone 4S from iOS 9 to iOS 6.1.3 following a signing window, which opened in January 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2018/01/10/users-able-downgrade-from-ios-11/|title=Apple servers currently signing older iOS updates, users able to downgrade from iOS 11|last=Mayo|first=Benjamin|date=2018-01-11|website=9to5Mac|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and closed in November 2019. The option to downgrade to iOS 6.1.3 also allowed an over-the-air update to iOS 8.4.1 due to technical limitations preventing a direct update from iOS 6 to iOS 9.

====2019 GPS rollover update====

On July 22, 2019, Apple released iOS 9.3.6 for the iPhone 4S to fix issues caused by the [[GPS Week Number Rollover|GPS week number rollover]]. The issues would impact the accuracy of GPS location and set the device's date and time to an incorrect value&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208010#936|title=About iOS 9 Updates|publisher=Apple}}&lt;/ref&gt;, preventing connection to [[HTTPS]] servers and, consequently, Apple's servers for activation, iCloud and the iTunes and App stores.
The release of iOS 9.3.6 for the iPhone 4S makes it the longest supported iPhone to date, at nine years of support.

[[File:Apple A5 Chip.jpg|thumb|left|Apple A5 chip used in the iPhone 4S]]
The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} uses the [[Apple A5]] [[system-on-chip]] (SoC) that incorporates an Imagination Technologies PowerVR SGX543 graphics processing unit ([[GPU]]). This GPU features pixel, vertex, and geometry shader hardware supporting [[OpenGL ES]] 2.0. The SGX543 is an improved version of the GPU used in the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}'s predecessor, the iPhone 4. The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} uses a dual-core model that is integrated with the Apple A5 SoC in the same way as the iPad 2.&lt;ref name="techradar 4s gaming"&gt;{{cite web

The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} has 512&amp;nbsp;MB of [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR2 RAM]].&lt;ref name=ifixit-teardown&gt;{{cite web |title=iPhone 4S Teardown |publisher=[[iFixit]] |date=October 13, 2011 |url= http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone-4S-Teardown/6610/1 |accessdate=December 24, 2013 |quote=Check out the marking, specifically E4E4, denoting two 2&amp;nbsp;Gb LPDDR2 die—for a total of 4&amp;nbsp;Gb—or 512&amp;nbsp;MB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximum available storage size increased to 64&amp;nbsp;GB while the 32&amp;nbsp;GB and 16&amp;nbsp;GB model options were retained. In September 2013 Apple released an iPhone 4S for free with a two-year contract and but with only 8 GB of storage. The screen is the same as the prior generation iPhones; {{convert|3.5|in|mm}}, 640×960 resolution (Apple's "retina" design).&lt;ref name="chaffin" /&gt; There was an improvement in interactive   multimedia applications compared to its predecessor.&lt;ref name="gizmodo" /&gt;[[File:Apple iPhone 4s White 30-pin Dock.JPG|thumb|The iPhone 4S uses the same proprietary 30-pin dock connector that is used on the iPhone 4.]]

The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} has an improved cellular (GSM) antenna design over the iPhone 4. The new antenna is divided up into two pieces within the stainless steel band that wraps around the sides of the phone. Therefore, if the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} is gripped in such a way as to attenuate one piece of the cellular antenna, the radio will switch to the other piece that isn't being gripped.&lt;ref name="PC World" /&gt; The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} can support a maximum theoretical download speed of up to 14.4&amp;nbsp;[[Mbps]] with [[HSDPA+]]. As a result of an upgraded radio chip inside the phone, in addition to being a [[world phone]], both [[GSM]] and [[Code division multiple access|CDMA]] customers can roam internationally on GSM networks.&lt;ref name=chaffin&gt;{{cite news |last=Chaffin |first=Bryan |title=Apple Announces iPhone 4S: New Antenna, 64GB Capacity (Update) |publisher=The Mac Observer |date=October 5, 2011 |url= http://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/apple_announces_iphone_4s_new_antenna_better_battery/ |accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also supports [[Bluetooth]] 4.0.&lt;ref name="4S" /&gt;

The camera on the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}, also known as an [[iSight]] camera, can take 8-[[megapixel]] photos (3,264 by 2,448&amp;nbsp;pixels) and record 1080p videos at up to 30&amp;nbsp;[[frames per second]] with upgraded quality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lambert |first=Patrick |title=iPhone 4S camera comparisons compilation |publisher=TideArt |date=October 18, 2011 |url=http://tideart.com/?id=4e9dc842 |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (30% better clarity, 26% better white balance, color accuracy) due to an additional lens, [[IR filter]], a wider f/2.4 aperture, and ''Image signal processor'' (built-in A5).&lt;ref name="chaffin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foresman |first=Chris |title=Why the improved camera in the iPhone 4S is good news for shutterbugs |publisher=Ars Technica |date=October 2010 |url= https://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/10/why-the-improve-camera-in-the-iphone-4s-is-good-news-for-shutterbugs.ars |accessdate=October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The built-in [[gyroscope]] allows for some image stabilization for the camera while recording video, although it still has room for improvement, since state-of-the-art image stabilization algorithms do not need to use a gyroscope, but use image processing. Other features of the camera are macro (for close up pictures) and faster capture including being able to take its first picture in 1.1&amp;nbsp;seconds and the next half a second later.&lt;ref name=gizmodo&gt;{{cite news |last=Diaz |first=Jesus |title=New Apple iPhone 4S: All the Information |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |date=October 4, 2011 |url=https://gizmodo.com/5846504/new-apple-iphone-all-the-information |accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chaffin" /&gt;

The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} features a {{convert|89|mm|in}} 960 by 640&amp;nbsp;[[pixel]] [[multitouch]] [[Retina display]]. It has two volume buttons and a ring/silent switch on the left side.&lt;ref name="apple" /&gt; On the top left there is a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[headphone jack]] and a [[Noise-canceling microphone|microphone]] that is used for both [[noise cancellation]] during calls and when in speakerphone/[[FaceTime]] (video calling) mode.

The bottom of the device features a speaker output on the right and a microphone input on the left with Apple's proprietary 30-pin dock connector in the center.&lt;ref name="apple" /&gt; The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} supports video out via [[AirPlay]] and various Apple A/V cables.&lt;ref name="chaffin" /&gt; Supported video formats include H.264 (1080p 30 frames per second maximum), MPEG-4 video, and [[motion JPEG]] (M-JPEG).&lt;ref name="chaffin" /&gt;

In addition to user inputs, the device also has several sensors that give the phone information about its orientation and external conditions. These include a three-axis gyroscope, an accelerometer, a proximity sensor, and an ambient light sensor.&lt;ref name="4S" /&gt; The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} claimed to have 200&amp;nbsp;hours standby time, 8&amp;nbsp;hours talk time on 3G, 14&amp;nbsp;hours talk time on 2G, 6&amp;nbsp;hours 3G browsing, and 9&amp;nbsp;hours [[Wi-Fi]] browsing.&lt;ref name=4S&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple iPhone 4S |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html |accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chaffin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple iPhone 4 Tech Specs |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-4/specs.html |accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it can sustain up to 10&amp;nbsp;hours of video playback or 40&amp;nbsp;hours of audio playback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple iPhone 4S Tech Specs |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-4s/specs.html |accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design ===
[[File:IPhone4SiPhone4.png|thumb|alt=An iPhone 4 on top of an iPhone 4S.|Comparison of the [[iPhone 4]] ([[GSM]]) antenna placement (top) with that of the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} (bottom). Notice the repositioning of the antennas which forms the perimeter around the phone; the iPhone 4 antenna is on the top of the phone while on the iPhone 4S, the antennas are on the sides. This side antenna placement meant a benefit of cellular signal attenuation and was used in later models like the [[iPhone 5]].]]

The {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} has a [[stainless steel]], dual cellular antenna design, identical to iPhone 4 [[CDMA]]. Apple redesigned the antenna in the {{nowrap|iPhone 4}} CDMA after some original iPhone 4 users reported cellular signal attenuation problems as a result of holding the phone in certain positions. The improved cellular radio in the phone can switch between two antennas, depending on which is sending/receiving the best signal. These two antennas are incorporated into the distinctive stainless steel band that wraps around the sides of the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}.&lt;ref name="PC World"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Mark |title=New iPhone 4S: Antenna 'Death Grip' Now Slightly Harder |work=[[PCWorld (magazine)|PCWorld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=October 5, 2011 |url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/241186/new_iphone_4s_antenna_death_grip_now_slightly_harder.html |accessdate=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bands on the iPhone 4S are divided into two antennas: [[cellular network|cellular]] and [[Global Positioning System]] GPS, with [[Bluetooth]] and [[Wi-Fi]] reliant on an internal antenna.&lt;ref name="apple" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Anand&gt;{{cite news |last=Shimpi |first=Anand |title=Apple iPhone 4S: Thoroughly Reviewed |publisher=Anandtech |date=October 31, 2011 |url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4971/apple-iphone-4s-review-att-verizon/9 |accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPhone 4 and 4S were designed by [[Jonathan Ive]]. The '4' generation iPhones differ from earlier Apple designs; the bulges of the back panel as well as the band between the front and back are gone and have been replaced with flattened surfaces. The redesign reflects the [[Utilitarianism (architecture)|utilitarianism]] and uniformity of existing Apple products, such as the [[iPad]] and the [[iMac]]. The overall dimensions of the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} are lower than that of the 3GS.&lt;ref name="Helf, Miguel"&gt;{{cite news |last=Helf |first=Miguel |last2=Wortham |first2=Jenna |title=On Newest iPhone, Another Camera |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= June 7, 2010 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/08/technology/08apple.html |accessdate= May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is {{convert|115|mm|in}} high, {{convert|59|mm|in}} wide, and {{convert|9.4|mm|in}} deep, compared to the [[iPhone 3GS]], which is {{convert|116|mm|in}} high, {{convert|62|mm|in}} wide, and {{convert|12|mm|in}} deep; making the iPhone 4 and 4S 21.5% thinner than the 3GS. The internal components are situated between two panels of [[aluminosilicate]] glass, described by Apple as being "chemically strengthened to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times harder than plastic," theoretically allowing it to be more scratch-resistant and durable than the prior models.&lt;ref name="Definitive Guide"&gt;{{cite news |last=Diaz |first=Jesus |title=iPhone 4: The Definitive Guide |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |date= June 7, 2010 |url= https://gizmodo.com/5557101/iphone-4-the-definitive-guide |accessdate= May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="endiff"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cooper |first=Daniel |title=iPhone 4S vs. iPhone 4: what's changed? |publisher=[[Engadget]] |date=October 4, 2011 |url= https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/04/iphone-4s-vs-iphone-4-the-tale-of-the-tape/ |accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Reception to the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} was generally favorable. Reviewers noted Siri, the new camera, and processing speeds as significant advantages over the prior model.&lt;ref name="vergejoshua"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="engadgetreviewtim"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stevens |first=Tim |title=iPhone 4S review |publisher=[[Engadget]] |date=October 14, 2011 |url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/14/iphone-4s-review/ |accessdate=April 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Stevens of [[Engadget]] said that the "{{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} does everything better than the iPhone 4, but it simply doesn't do anything substantially different."&lt;ref name="engadgetreviewtim" /&gt; [[Joshua Topolsky]] of [[The Verge (website)|The Verge]] stated that "if this were to be a car, it would be a Mercedes" and that Siri is "probably one of the most novel applications Apple has ever produced."&lt;ref name="vergejoshua"&gt;{{cite news |last=Topolsky |first=Joshua |authorlink=Joshua Topolsky |title=iPhone 4S review |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |work=[[The Verge (website)|The Verge]] |date=October 11, 2011 |url= https://www.theverge.com/apple/2011/10/12/2484524/iphone-4s-review |accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most reviewers thought that Siri was the most important feature on the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}. Brian Chen of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' said that "the fifth-generation iPhone's superb camera and speedy dual-core processor are classy additions. But Siri is the reason people should buy this phone."&lt;ref name="wired2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Chen |first=Brian |title=With Siri, the iPhone Finds Its Voice |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]] |date=October 11, 2011 |url=https://www.wired.com/reviews/2011/10/iphone4s/ |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrevo surveyed more than 1,300 U.S. consumers and reported that 71 percent of all smartphone owners were not disappointed by the new {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} but 47 percent or almost a half of current [[iPhone 4]] owners were; 12 percent were hoping for a bigger display, 21 percent wanted a refreshed design, and 29 percent desired [[4G]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Epstein |first=Zach |title=Survey: 29% of smartphone owners, 47% of iPhone 4 owners disappointed in iPhone 4S |date=October 13, 2011 |url= http://www.bgr.com/2011/10/13/survey-29-of-smartphone-owners-47-of-iphone-4-owners-disappointed-in-iphone-4s/ |publisher=Boy Genius Report |accessdate=April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Echoing technology pundits, [[Reuters]] suggested that the lack of a more radical departure from the iPhone 4 could open new market opportunities for rivals.&lt;ref name=Reuters&gt;{{cite news |last=Jim |first=Clare |title=Apple stumble seen opening door for rivals |agency=[[Thomson Reuters]] |publisher=Reuters |date=October 5, 2011 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/05/us-apple-asia-idUSTRE7940JQ20111005 |accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analyst C. K. Lu of [[Gartner]] believed that Apple no longer had the leading edge and that the 4S would only sell due to brand loyalty, as fans had been expecting an iPhone 5 with a thinner profile, edge-to-edge screen, and stronger features.&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt; These same fans had also wanted a cheaper, stripped-down iPhone 4.&lt;ref name="gizmodo" /&gt;

Gaming on the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} has been likened to the [[PlayStation Vita]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Peters |first=Luke |title=Apple iPhone 4S Preview: Hands on |work=[[T3 (magazine)|T3]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |date=October 6, 2011 |url= http://www.t3.com/reviews/iphone-4s-review |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Castle |first=Alex |title=Gaming Showdown: Playstation Vita vs iPhone 4S |work=[[Maximum PC]] |publisher=[[Future US]] |date=April 10, 2012 |url= http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/gaming_showdown_playstation_vita_vs_iphone_4s |accessdate = May 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that features the same SGX GPU only in a quad-core configuration, and the [[Nintendo 3DS]] [[handheld game console]]s. Further, the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}' ability to process 80 million [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygons]] per second&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PS Vita vs Nintendo 3DS vs iPhone 4S: Specs Compared |work=NowGamer |publisher=Imagine Publishing Ltd. |location=England |date=October 22, 2011 |url= http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1141172/ps_vita_vs_nintendo_3ds_vs_iphone_4s_specs_showdown.html |accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been compared to the [[PlayStation 3]] and the Xbox 360 home [[video game console]]s that can process 275 million and 500 million polygons per second respectively.&lt;ref name="techradar 4s gaming" /&gt;

[[Computer and Video Games]]'s (CVG) deputy editor Andy Robinson told [[TechRadar]] that the "4S is certainly laying down some serious credibility for the iPhone as a core gaming device. Not only is it now pushing out games that simply eclipse the 3DS visually, but features like cloud saving and TV streaming support are really exciting for gamers."&lt;ref name="techradar 4s gaming" /&gt; The senior gaming analyst at Jon Peddie Research, Ted Pollak, believes the biggest improvement to gaming on the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} is the [[Siri|voice control]] features, noting that "one of the features that [[Nintendogs]] players loved was the ability to talk to it. There's no reason why a game like that couldn't be done on the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}, and much more sophisticated given the voice control shown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Peterson |first=Steve |title=The New iPhone 4S: Game Changer? |publisher=IndustryGamers |date=October 4, 2011 |url=http://www.industrygamers.com/news/the-new-iphone-4s-game-changer/ |access-date=October 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007173403/http://www.industrygamers.com/news/the-new-iphone-4s-game-changer |archive-date=October 7, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the iPhone 4S won T3's "Work Gadget of the Year" award, beating [[Research in Motion|RIM]]'s [[Blackberry Bold#BlackBerry 7 series|Blackberry Bold 9900]], rival [[Samsung]]'s [[Samsung Galaxy Note (original)|Galaxy Note]] amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apple iPhone 4S - Worst Gadget of the Year |publisher=T3 |url=http://awards.t3.com/categories/work-gadget-of-the-year/apple-iphone-4s |accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issues===
[[File:IPhone 4S Cracked rear.jpg|thumb|An iPhone 4S with a cracked rear cover. The glass rear covers on the iPhone 4S (along with the [[iPhone 4]]) were notorious for cracking easily after an accidental fall. A similar design (glass body with stainless-steel frame) was later reused with the introduction of the [[iPhone X]] and [[iPhone 8]], although this second iteration of the glass-back design was for [[wireless charging]].]]

Since the introduction of the iPhone 4S, there have been several issues reported by users on internet forums that have been noted by media organizations such as [[CNN]], [[Boy Genius Report]], [[The Guardian]] and [[PC World]].
* No audio on outgoing calls.&lt;ref name="cnn ip4S no audio"&gt;{{cite news|author=Mikebe12345|title=CNN iReport - iPhone 4S No Audio on Outgoing Calls |publisher=CNN |date=December 6, 2011|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-713119 |accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gizmodo ip4S no audio"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bugs: The iPhone 4S Keeps Setting Outgoing Calls on Mute|publisher=Gizmodo |date=November 6, 2011 |url=https://gizmodo.com/5856807/the-iphone-4s-doesnt-care-about-your-outbound-calls |accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sometimes there is no speaker audio for services like web radio even though the speaker works fine when used as a telephone. This error may be due to a malfunctioning switch sensing the headphone plug and different handling of this information by different apps.
* Yellow-tinted screens (primarily affecting white-cased units).&lt;ref name="pcmag ip4S yellow"&gt;{{cite news |last=Strange |first=Adario |title=iPhone 4S Users Report Yellow Screen Issue|work=PC Magazine|date=October 18, 2011 |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2394830,00.asp |accessdate=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It turned out the previous models had a less accurately calibrated screen and thus displayed images with a bluish tint.
* Battery problems.&lt;ref name="pcmag ip4S battery"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yin |first=Sara |title=Report: Apple Investigates iPhone 4S Battery Issue |work=PC Magazine |date=October 29, 2011 |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2395546,00.asp |accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian ip4S battery"&gt;{{cite news |last=Arthur |first=Charles |title=iPhone 4S battery life problems: bug in location services suspected |location=London |work=The Guardian |date=October 29, 2011 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/29/iphone-4s-battery-location-services-bug |accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple released iOS 5.1.1 to diagnose and address the issue.&lt;ref name="pcworld ip4S battery"&gt;{{cite news |last=Paul |first=Ian |title=The Beta appears to have problems |format=JavaScript required to view date |work=TechHive |publisher=[[PC World]] (IDG Consumer &amp;amp; SMB) |date=November 3, 2011 |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/243092/ios_501_beta_addresses_iphone_4s_battery_woes.html |accessdate=December 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the update has failed to completely resolve the underperforming battery issue. {{As of|February 2012}}, Apple was still investigating the battery drain issue. 
* Not understanding the accent of users from various countries while speaking to Siri.&lt;ref name="fastcompany ip4S siri"&gt;{{cite news |title=Siri, Why Can't You Understand Me? |publisher=Fast Company |date=December 7, 2011 |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1799374/siri-why-cant-you-understand-me |accessdate=December 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DM ip4S siri"&gt;{{cite news |title=Scottish iPhone users are lost in translation - because Siri can't understand the accent |publisher=Daily Mail |date=October 26, 2011 |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2053684/Scottish-iPhone-users-lost-translation--Siri-understand-accent.html |accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bluetooth connectivity and range sometimes poor, deficient, and/or defective. The sound quality on the other end is muffled and/or undiscernible, with reports indicating the iPhone is likely the problem as opposed to the Bluetooth headsets.&lt;ref name="macworld ip4S bluetooth"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bugs &amp; Fixes: Problems pairing iPhones to Bluetooth audio systems |publisher=Macworld |date=March 30, 2012 |url= http://www.macworld.com/article/1166142/bugs_and_fixes_problems_pairing_iphones_to_bluetooth_audio_systems.html  |accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wi-Fi overheating and toggle switch greyed out after updating the operating system to iOS 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/10/10/ios-7-update-brings-more-wi-fi-issues-for-some-iphone-4s-owners|title=iOS 7 update brings more Wi-Fi issues for some iPhone 4S owners|date=October 10, 2013|work=AppleInsider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commercial reception===
Unlike prior iPhone models, the number of sales of the iPhone 4 had not yet climaxed before the introduction of the 4S. Previous iPhone models were released during or after declining sales figures. In addition, iPhone 4 users had high marks for being satisfied with their phones. Upon the announcement of the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}}, shares of [[Samsung Electronics]], [[HTC Corporation|HTC]] and [[Nokia]] gained on Wednesday after the 4S was announced, while Apple stock fell. However, later in the day, Apple shares rebounded ending with a 1% gain.

With the launch of orders, AT&amp;T said that the demand for the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} was "extraordinary".&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |title=AT&amp;T: Initial demand for iPhone 4S 'extraordinary' |agency=[[Gannett Company]] |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=October 8, 2011 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2011-10-07/atampT-iphone-4s/50695302/1 |accessdate=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=iPhone 4S Presale Demand Is 'Extraordinary,' Says AT&amp;T |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=October 7, 2011 |url= https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/08/iphone-4s-presale-att_n_1001383.html |accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 200,000 orders were placed within 12 hours of release through AT&amp;T. The German phone company [[Deutsche Telekom]] said they were "satisfied" with consumer interest. In addition, AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Sprint sold-out initial stock by October 8, 2011, and by October 9 there was a 1–2 week estimate on new orders to be filled. On October 20, 2011, AT&amp;T surpassed one million {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} activations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Crook |first=Jordan |title=AT&amp;T Surpasses 1 Million iPhone 4S Activations |publisher=[[TechCrunch]] |date=October 20, 2011 |url= https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/20/att-surpasses-1-million-iphone-4s-activations/ |accessdate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 10, Apple announced that more than one million orders for the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} had been received within the first 24 hours of it being on sale, beating the 600,000 device record set by the iPhone 4.&lt;ref name=apple-iphone4s-1million-24hours&gt;{{cite press release |title=iPhone 4S Pre-Orders Top One Million in First 24 Hours |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |date=October 10, 2011 |url= https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/10/10iPhone-4S-Pre-Orders-Top-One-Million-in-First-24-Hours.html |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Anderson |first=Ash |title=iPhone 4S Sells 1 Million in Under 24 Hours |publisher=KeyNoodle |date=October 10, 2011 |url=http://www.keynoodle.com/iphone-4s-sells-1-million-in-under-24-hours/ |accessdate=October 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601170143/http://www.keynoodle.com/iphone-4s-sells-1-million-in-under-24-hours/ |archive-date=June 1, 2012 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 16-month wait between the iPhone 4 and 4S may have contributed to overwhelming sales as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rapaport |first=Lisa |last2=Wang |first2=Xu |title=Apple received more than 1 million pre-orders for iPhone 4S in a day |work=[[The Economic Times]] |publisher=[[The Times Group]] |date=October 11, 2011 |url= http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/apple-received-more-than-1-million-pre-orders-for-iphone-4s-in-a-day/articleshow/10307358.cms |accessdate=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wi |first=Wendy |title=iPhone 4S Sold Out: Pre-order Record in Memory of Steve Jobs?

On October 17, 2011, Apple had announced that four million units of the {{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} were sold in the first three days of release, and 25&amp;nbsp;million iOS users had upgraded to the then latest version of iOS, iOS 5, which was released upon the introduction of the phone. [[Philip W. Schiller|Phil Schiller]], Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing, stated that the "{{nowrap|iPhone 4S}} is off to a great start with more than four million sold in its first weekend—the most ever for a phone and more than double the iPhone 4 launch during its first three days."&lt;ref name="apple-iphone4s-4million-3days" /&gt; The used phone market saw unprecedented rates of trade-ins in the weeks leading up to the 4S announcement, and after it there was a drop in prices offered.&lt;ref name=daw&gt;{{cite news |last=Daw |first=David |title=Where to Sell Your Old iPhone or How to Pick One Up Cheaply |work=[[PCWorld (magazine)|PCWorld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=October 6, 2011 |url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/241366/where_to_sell_your_old_iphone_or_how_to_pick_one_up_cheaply.html#tk.mod_rel |accessdate=October 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous generation iPhones are recirculated through the markets through various methods and third-party buyers may purchase older generation iPhones.
