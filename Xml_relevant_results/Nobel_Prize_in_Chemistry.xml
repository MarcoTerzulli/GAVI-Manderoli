The '''Nobel Prize in Chemistry''' is awarded annually by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] to scientists in the various fields of [[chemistry]]. It is one of the five [[Nobel Prize]]s established by the will of [[Alfred Nobel]] in 1895, awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, [[Nobel Prize in Physics|physics]], [[Nobel Prize in Literature|literature]], [[Nobel Peace Prize|peace]], and [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|physiology or medicine]]. This award is administered by the [[Nobel Foundation]], and awarded by Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on proposal of the [[Nobel Committee for Chemistry]] which consists of five members elected by Academy. The award is presented in [[Stockholm]] at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. 

The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]], of the Netherlands, "for his discovery of the laws of chemical dynamics and [[osmotic pressure]] in solutions." From 1901 to 2018, the award has been bestowed on a total of 180 individuals.&lt;ref name="nobelprize.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/chemistry/|website=nobelprize.org|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Alfred Nobel]] stipulated in his last will and testament that his money be used to create a series of prizes for those who confer the "greatest benefit on mankind" in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[peace]], [[physiology]] or [[medicine]], and [[literature]].&lt;ref name="BBCHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/nobel_alfred.shtml |title=History – Historic Figures: Alfred Nobel (1833–1896) |publisher=[[BBC]] |date= |accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/nobelprize/article-9056008 |title=Guide to Nobel Prize |publisher=[[Britannica]] |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Nobel wrote several wills during his lifetime, the last was written a little over a year before he died, and signed at the Swedish-Norwegian Club in [[Paris]] on 27 November 1895.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sohlman69|Ragnar Sohlman]]: 1983, Page 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = von Euler|first = U.S.|title = The Nobel Foundation and its Role for Modern Day Science|url = http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=xu7j67w616m06488&amp;size=largest|format = PDF|publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]|work = [[Die Naturwissenschaften]]|date = 6 June 1981|accessdate = 21 January 2010|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110714080803/http://resources.metapress.com/pdf-preview.axd?code=xu7j67w616m06488&amp;size=largest|archivedate = 14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31&amp;nbsp;million [[Swedish krona|Swedish ''kronor'']] ([[USD|US]]$198 million, [[Euro|€]]176 million in 2016), to establish and endow the five Nobel Prizes.&lt;ref name=Nobelwill&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/index.html "The Will of Alfred Nobel"], ''nobelprize.org''. Retrieved 6 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the level of skepticism surrounding the will, it was not until April 26, 1897 that it was approved by the [[Parliament of Norway|Storting]] (Norwegian Parliament).&lt;ref name="nobelprize1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobelfoundation/history/lemmel/index.html |title=The Nobel Foundation – History |publisher=Nobelprize.org |accessdate=2010-01-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109140259/http://nobelprize.org/nobelfoundation/history/lemmel/index.html |archivedate=January 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levinovitz13"&gt;[[#Levinovitz69|Agneta Wallin Levinovitz]]: 2001, Page 13&lt;/ref&gt; The executors of his will were [[Ragnar Sohlman]] and Rudolf Lilljequist, who formed the [[Nobel Foundation]] to take care of Nobel's fortune and organise the prizes.

The members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that were to award the [[Nobel Peace Prize|Peace Prize]] were appointed shortly after the will was approved. The prize-awarding organisations followed: the [[Karolinska Institutet]] on June 7, the [[Swedish Academy]] on June 9, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on June 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/nobel-prize-history.html |title=Nobel Prize History — |publisher=[[Infoplease]] |date=1999-10-13 |accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/416852/Nobel-Foundation |title=Nobel Foundation (Scandinavian organisation) |publisher=Britannica |date= |accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nobel Foundation then reached an agreement on guidelines for how the Nobel Prize should be awarded. In 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly created [[statute]]s were promulgated by King [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar II]].&lt;ref name="Levinovitz13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thelocal1"&gt;AFP, [http://www.thelocal.se/14776/20091005/ "Alfred Nobel's last will and testament"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009000000/http://www.thelocal.se/14776/20091005/ |date=October 9, 2009 }}, ''[[The Local]]''(5 October 2009): accessed 20 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BritannicaWill&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/416856/Nobel-Prize "Nobel Prize]" (2007), in ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', accessed 15 January 2009, from ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'': {{quote|After Nobel's death, the Nobel Foundation was set up to carry out the provisions of his will and to administer his funds. In his will, he had stipulated that four different institutions—three Swedish and one Norwegian—should award the prizes. From Stockholm, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences confers the prizes for physics, chemistry, and economics, the Karolinska Institute confers the prize for physiology or medicine, and the Swedish Academy confers the prize for literature. The Norwegian Nobel Committee based in [[Oslo]] confers the prize for peace. The Nobel Foundation is the legal owner and functional administrator of the funds and serves as the joint administrative body of the prize-awarding institutions, but it is not concerned with the prize deliberations or decisions, which rest exclusively with the four institutions. }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nobel's will, The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences were to award the Prize in Chemistry.&lt;ref name=BritannicaWill/&gt;

==Award ceremony==
{{Main article|Nobel Prize}}
The committee and institution serving as the selection board for the prize typically announce the names of the laureates in October. The prize is then awarded at formal ceremonies held annually on December 10, the anniversary of [[Alfred Nobel]]'s death.  "The highlight of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm is when each Nobel Laureate steps forward to receive the prize from the hands of His Majesty the King of Sweden. The Nobel Laureate receives three things: a diploma, a medal and a document confirming the prize amount" ("What the Nobel Laureates Receive").  Later the ''Nobel Banquet'' is held in [[Stockholm City Hall]].

A maximum of three laureates and two different works may be selected. The award can be given to a maximum of three recipients per year. It consists of a gold medal, a diploma, and a cash grant.

==Nomination and selection==
{{Main article|Nobel Prize}}
[[File:Vant Hoff.jpg|thumb|right|upright|In 1901 [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff]] (1852–1911) received the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry.]]
The [[List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry|Nobel Laureates in chemistry]] are selected by a committee that consists of five members elected by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. In its first stage, several thousand people are asked to nominate candidates. These names are scrutinized and discussed by experts until only the laureates remain. This slow and thorough process, is arguably what gives the prize its importance.

Forms, which amount to a personal and exclusive invitation, are sent to about three thousand selected individuals to invite them to submit nominations. The names of the nominees are never publicly announced, and neither are they told that they have been considered for the Prize. Nomination records are sealed for fifty years. In practice, some nominees do become known. It is also common for publicists to make such a claim – founded or not.

The nominations are screened by committee, and a list is produced of approximately two hundred preliminary candidates. This list is forwarded to selected experts in the field. They remove all but approximately fifteen names. The committee submits a report with recommendations to the appropriate institution.

While posthumous nominations are not permitted, awards can occur if the individual died in the months between the nomination and the decision of the prize committee.

The award in chemistry requires  the significance of achievements being recognized is "tested by time." In practice it means that the lag between the discovery and the award is typically on the order of 20 years and can be much longer. As a downside of this approach, not all scientists live long enough for their work to be recognized. Some important scientific discoveries are never considered for a Prize, as the discoverers may have died by the time the impact of their work is realized.

Each medal feature an image of Alfred Nobel in left profile on the obverse (front side of the medal). The Nobel Prize medals for Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, and Literature have identical obverses, showing the image of Alfred Nobel and the years of his birth and death (1833–1896). Nobel's portrait also appears on the obverse of the Nobel Peace Prize medal and the Medal for the Prize in Economics, but with a slightly different design.&lt;ref name=PaulingPeacePrize&gt;[http://digitalcollections.library.oregonstate.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/pawardsmedals&amp;CISOPTR=47 "The Nobel Prize for Peace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916090914/http://digitalcollections.library.oregonstate.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=%2Fpawardsmedals&amp;CISOPTR=47 |date=2009-09-16 }}, "Linus Pauling: Awards, Honors, and Medals", ''Linus Pauling and The Nature of the Chemical Bond: A Documentary History'', the [[The Valley Library|Valley Library]], [[Oregon State University]].

===Nobel Prize diplomas===
Nobel laureates receive a diploma directly from the hands of the King of Sweden. Each diploma is uniquely designed by the prize-awarding institutions for the laureate that receives it. The diploma contains a picture and text which states the name of the laureate and normally a citation of why they received the prize.&lt;ref name="nobelprize5"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/diplomas/ |title=The Nobel Diplomas |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Award money===
At the awards ceremony, the laureate is given a document indicating the award sum. The amount of the cash award may differ from year to year, based on the funding available from the [[Nobel Foundation]].  For example, in 2009 the total cash awarded was 10 million SEK (US$1.4 million),&lt;ref name="nobelprize2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/amounts/ |title=The Nobel Prize Amounts |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2012, the amount was 8 million Swedish Krona, or US$1.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2012-06-11/world/world_europe_nobel-prize-cut_1_nobel-prize-nobel-foundation-alfred-nobel?_s=PM:EUROPE|title=Nobel prize amounts to be cut 20% in 2012|publisher=CNN|date=2012-06-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709002611/http://articles.cnn.com/2012-06-11/world/world_europe_nobel-prize-cut_1_nobel-prize-nobel-foundation-alfred-nobel?_s=PM:EUROPE|archivedate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there are two laureates in a particular category, the award grant is divided equally between the recipients, but if there are three, the awarding committee may opt to divide the grant equally, or award half to one recipient and a quarter to each of the two others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/oct/05/nobel-prize-medicine-2009-award|title=Nobel prize for medicine shared by scientists for work on ageing and cancer &amp;#124; Science &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk|publisher=Guardian |date= 2009-10-05|accessdate=2010-01-15 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Sample}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ian Sample, Science correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/oct/07/physics.nobel |title=Three share Nobel prize for physics &amp;#124; Science &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2008-10-07|accessdate=2010-02-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Landes|url=http://www.thelocal.se/22604/20091012/ |title=Americans claim Nobel economics prize – The Local |publisher=Thelocal.se |date=|accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2009/press.html |title=The 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics – Press Release |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of award==
In recent years, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry has drawn criticism from chemists who feel that the prize is more frequently awarded to non-chemists than to chemists.&lt;ref name="grumble"&gt;{{cite journal|title=What, Another Nobel Prize in Chemistry to a Nonchemist?|date=9 Feb 2012|doi=10.1002/anie.201108514|pmid=22323188|volume=51|issue=8|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|pages=1734–1735|last1 = Hoffmann|first1 = Roald}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 30 years leading up to 2012, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded ten times for work classified as [[biochemistry]] or [[molecular biology]], and once to a [[materials science|materials scientist]]. In the ten years leading up to 2012, only four prizes were awarded for work strictly in chemistry.&lt;ref name="grumble" /&gt; Commenting on the scope of the award, ''[[The Economist]]'' explained that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is bound by Nobel's bequest, which specifies awards only in physics, chemistry, literature, medicine, and peace. Biology was in its infancy in Nobel's day and no award was established. ''The Economist'' argued there is no Nobel Prize for mathematics either, another major discipline, and added that Nobel's stipulation of no more than three winners is not readily applicable to modern physics, where progress is typically made through huge collaborations rather than by individuals alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/10/economist-explains-9|title=The Economist explains: Why is the Nobel prize in chemistry given for things that are not chemistry?|date=7 Oct 2015|accessdate=13 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
