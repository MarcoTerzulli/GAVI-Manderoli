In 2011, the company launched their expansion to the East Coast with the acquisition of the solar division of Clean Currents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/sbo/2011/01/solarcity-buys-clean-currents.html|title=SolarCity buys Clean Currents|last=|first=|date=Jan 24, 2011|website=www.bizjournals.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and groSolar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-city-acquires-grosolars-residential-installation-business|title=SolarCity Acquires groSolar’s Residential Installation Business|last=Wesoff|first=Eric|date=2011-02-17|website=www.greentechmedia.com|access-date=2019-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the acquisitions, SolarCity further expanded operations on the East Coast and opened in Connecticut&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.courant.com/business/hc-xpm-2012-02-07-hc-solar-city-expands-20120207-story.html|title=SolarCity, Solar Panel Company, Establishes Hartford Office|last=PODSADA|first=JANICE|website=courant.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Pennsylvania&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2016/11/04/Solar-City-eyeing-growth-in-Pittsburgh-region-opens-operations-center/stories/201611040063|title=Solar City, eyeing growth in Pittsburgh region, opens operations center|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|language=en|access-date=2019-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, South Carolina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2016/10/06/solarcity-expands-services-south-carolina/|website=[[cleantechnica.com]]|access-date=2019-03-01|title=SolarCity expands services into South Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Florida&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/technology/tech_check/os-solar-city-florida-expansion-20161201-story.html|title=Elon Musk's SolarCity expanding in Clermont|last=Santana|first=Marco|website=OrlandoSentinel.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Vermont&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vermontbiz.com/news/august/solarcity-launches-new-solar-loan-program-vermont|title=SolarCity launches new solar loan program in Vermont|date=2016-08-06|website=Vermont Business Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhpr.org/post/solar-energy-giant-move-nh-market|title=Solar Energy Giant To Move Into N.H.

In 2013, SolarCity was the leading residential solar installer in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/is-the-solarcity-model-the-only-way-to-scale-residential-solar Is the SolarCity Model the Only Way to Scale Residential Solar?], ''greentechmedia.com'', Nicole Litvak, March 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Solar Power World magazine listed it as the No. 2 overall solar installation company in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/top-250-solar-contractors/ |title=2013 Top 250 Solar Contractors|work=Solar Power World|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, SolarCity purchased Paramount Solar from [[Paramount Equity]] for $120 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://solarindustrymag.com/solarcity-completes-acquisition-of-paramount-solar |title=SolarCity Completes Acquisition of Paramount Solar|publisher= |date=11 September 2013|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014, it had installed panels capable of generating 6,200 MW of power.&lt;ref name=SEIAdata/&gt; In 2015, SolarCity installed 870MW of solar power,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarcity.com/sites/default/files/SolarCity_Impact_Report_2015.pdf |title=SolarCity 2015 Impact Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 28% of non-utility solar installation in the U.S. that year.&lt;ref name=SEIAdata/&gt;

In October 2014, SolarCity announced it would be offering up to $200 million in solar bonds to launch a new online website to buy the debt, the first registered public offering of such bonds in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/15/us-solarcity-bonds-idUSKCN0I41KO20141015 SolarCity offers $200 million solar bonds in first public offering].

In late 2015, SolarCity withdrew from solar sales and installation in Nevada, following the decision by the state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to raise the monthly service charge for rooftop solar customers and progressively reduce the return on solar energy sold back into the grid under the state's [[net metering]] rule.&lt;ref name="Whaley2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whaley|first1=Sean|title=SolarCity cuts 550 Nevada jobs, blames new net metering rate |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/solarcity-cuts-550-nevada-jobs-blames-new-net-metering-rate|accessdate=30 May 2016|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=6 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new rules, the monthly service charge imposed on Nevada Power's rooftop solar-generating customers rose from $12.75 to $17.90, and was scheduled to rise to $38.51 by January 1, 2020; simultaneously, the rates given to rooftop solar generating customers for their surplus solar energy were also clawed back and were to continue to decline over the ensuing four years.&lt;ref name="Whaley2016"/&gt; As a result, SolarCity eliminated more than 550 jobs in Nevada.&lt;ref name="Whaley2016"/&gt;

In June 2016, Musk's car and battery company, [[Tesla Inc.|Tesla]], submitted an offer to acquire SolarCity for $2.5–3 billion.&lt;ref name=TM2016-06-22&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.teslamotors.com/blog/tesla-makes-offer-to-acquire-solarcity |title=Tesla Makes Offer to Acquire SolarCity|website=www.teslamotors.com |access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Musk, the reason for this is "Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery &amp; solar power product that looks beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/752218264499949568?lang=en |title=Elon Musk on Twitter|date=10 July 2016 |accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, 2016, SolarCity accepted Tesla Motors' offer of $2.6 billion.

In August 2016, it was announced that the company planned to take up $5 million in charges to cover its planned layoffs. The company also cut the salaries of its two co-founders from $275,000 to $1 per year.&lt;ref&gt;Allana Akhtar, WGRZ.

===Subsidiary of Tesla Inc. (2016–present)===
On August 1, 2016, Tesla announced in a joint statement with SolarCity it would be acquiring the company in an all-stock $2.6 billion merger.

===Solar leasing===
In 2008, SolarCity entered the solar leasing market with a new solar lease option for homeowners: leasing rooftop solar to customers who would pay no upfront costs. In exchange, customers paid for 20 years for power generated by those panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.reuters.com/environment/2008/04/24/solar-power-for-less-than-your-cable-bill/ |title=Solar power for less than your cable bill &amp;#124; Environment Forum |publisher=Blogs.reuters.com |date= 2008-04-24|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; SolarCity's solar lease allowed some homeowners to pay less each month than they previously paid for electricity from the utility company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Earnest |first=John |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/northcounty/20080927-9999-1mc27solar.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001113917/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/northcounty/20080927-9999-1mc27solar.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-10-01 |title=Leasing a solar-power system |publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com |date=2008-09-27 |accessdate=2011-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sistek |first=Hanna |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-9994005-54.html |title=SolarCity provides SF power below grid price &amp;#124; Green Tech - CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2008-07-18 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Installation technology===
SolarCity provides technologies for mounting solar panels on rooftops developed by [[Zep Solar]], which it acquired in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/uciliawang/2013/10/09/solarcity-buys-zep-to-cut-labor-time-for-rooftop-solar/|title=SolarCity Buys Zep To Cut Labor Time For Rooftop Solar|first=Ucilia|last=Wang|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zep is best known for inventing a system that allows PV installers to "snap together" panels on the roof more quickly than other installation approaches, in order to shorten installation time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/SolarCity-Aims-Zep-Solar-Technology-at-Commercial-Solar-Rooftops|title=SolarCity Aims Zep Solar Technology at Commercial Rooftops|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zep Solar's technology eliminates the need for mounting rails on many roof types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-death-of-rails|title=Will Railed Solar Racking Systems Soon Be Obsolete in the Residential Sector?|publisher=|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar roof===
&lt;!--{{Main|Tesla Solar Roof}}--&gt;
In August 2016, Musk announced that Tesla would be introducing a new product called the Tesla Solar Roof where the [[photovoltaic]] electrical energy generating devices and system would make up an entire roof surface, rather than merely be the mounting of solar panels on an existing roof, as solar energy systems have generally been designed and installed during the early decades of terrestrial solar power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cleantechnica.com/2016/08/12/elon-musk-solarcity-cto-peter-rive-announce-solar-roof-not-solar-roof/ Elon Musk &amp; SolarCity CTO Peter Rive Announce "Solar Roof" (Not "Solar On The Roof") |CleanTechnica]&lt;/ref&gt; He stated "It’s not a thing on a roof.

Also unveiled was the [[Tesla Powerwall]] 2, a home battery product designed to store surplus power, either from the tiles or from the grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37809151 |title=Tesla shows off solar roof tiles |publisher=BBC |date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Consumer Reports]] compared the estimated economy of solar roofs to traditional roofing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/roofing/heres-how-much-teslas-new-solar-roof-shingles-could-cost/ |title=Here's How Much Tesla's New Solar Roof Could Cost|first=Daniel |last=DiClerico|work=[[Consumer Reports]] |date=2 November 2016|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://buffalonews.com/2016/11/18/musks-solar-roof-may-not-pricey/ |title=Price of Tesla’s solar shingles may not be through the roof |first=David |last=Robinson |work=[[The Buffalo News]] |date=18 November 2016|accessdate=20 November 2016|quote= Consumer Reports suggested the upfront cost could be upwards of $70,000, before incentives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, limited production of tiles for the Tesla Solar Roof had begun at the company's Buffalo, New York [[Gigafactory 2]] (Giga New York).&lt;ref name=RoofBegin&gt;Ayre, James.

Version 2 had turned out to be excessively artisanal and required too much labor at the house, greatly increasing costs.&lt;ref name="tc20191025" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mashable.com/article/tesla-solar-roof-version-3/ Tesla unveils next-gen Solar Roof (and it can be installed in 8 hours, promises Musk)], Mashable, 25 October 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 25, 2019, Tesla announced "version 3" (V3) of the solar roof design, with a price point for V3 that is expected to be less than the price point of a new roof plus adding solar panels, approximately 80 percent of the time when comparing competitive quotes.&lt;ref name="tc20191025" /&gt;  It is not expected to be cost competitive for roofs that have a number of years of roof life left; it is expected to be quite competitive for roof replacement when the customer also wants to add solar.

===Government-funded collaboration===
The SunShot Initiative is a national effort to support solar energy adoption to make solar energy affordable for all Americans. It is run by the US Department of Energy's Solar Energy Technologies Office and funds research, development, demonstration, and deployment projects. It is a collaboration of private companies, universities, state and local governments, and nonprofits, as well as national laboratories. The program began in 2011 with the initial goal of making solar energy competitive with traditional forms of electricity by 2020. By 2016, the program achieved 70% of the progress towards the 2020 goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/about-sunshot-initiative |title=About the SunShot Initiative {{!}} Department of Energy|website=energy.gov |language=en |access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20170211131857/http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/about-sunshot-initiative --&gt;

In the fiscal year 2012 Congressional budget, the program was appropriated $457 million. According to the US Department of Energy's appropriation request for that year, "The program also encourages Systems Integration by developing ''radically new approaches'' to reduce the cost and improve reliability and functionality of power electronics and supporting industry development through test and evaluation standards, and tools for understanding grid integration issues."&lt;ref&gt;[https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/12/f5/eere_fy2012_appropriations_overview.pdf "Overview: Appropriation by Program"].

SolarCity was involved in a collaboration with the program along with the Energy Department's [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] and [[Hawaiian Electric Industries]]. Using government and taxpayer funds, SolarCity helped 2,500 Hawaii residential customers connect their solar power systems to the grid by the end of December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://energy.gov/eere/success-stories/articles/eere-success-story-sunshot-funded-advanced-inverter-testing-enables |title=EERE Success Story—SunShot-funded Advanced Inverter Testing Enables 2,500 Solar Energy Systems to Connect to Hawaii’s Electric Grid|website=Energy.gov |language=en |access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20170215034119/https://energy.gov/eere/success-stories/articles/eere-success-story-sunshot-funded-advanced-inverter-testing-enables --&gt;

==Litigation and investigations==

===Buffalo Billion===
[[Buffalo Billion]] is a billion-dollar program from the administration of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to revitalize Buffalo, New York. One of the main features of the program is a 1.2 million square foot solar panel factory called SolarCity RiverBend. It will be owned by SolarCity. The factory "is expected to become the largest manufacturing facility in the Western Hemisphere when it opens". Hiring for the factory is expected in spring of 2017 and the factory is expected to begin producing solar cells by the summer of 2017.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/featured/3905-success-buffalo-billion-backed-solarcity-factory-remains-elusive/|title=Success of Buffalo Billion-backed SolarCity factory remains elusive|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2017-03-24|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The factory will be located in an "innovation hub" called the High-Tech Manufacturing Innovation Hub at RiverBend. The state appropriated $750 million in funding for the hub. According to ''Daily Energy Insider'', "The facility will have one [[watt#Gigawatt|gigawatt]] of annual solar capacity when it reaches full production and is expected to produce about 10,000 [[solar panel]]s per day." SolarCity is required to spend $5 billion over the next decade on the facility and create more than 1,460 direct manufacturing jobs.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

As of May 2016, federal investigators were investigating how money and contracts within the Buffalo Billion program were distributed. SolarCity was a partner in the program. The company intended to open a large solar panel factory on the Buffalo River. In May 2016, New York State officials postponed the approval of almost $500 million for the SolarCity project. According to ''The New York Times'', Buffalo Billion will benefit "a tangle of well-connected players – including developers and frequent donors to the governor – who have feasted on Buffalo Billion money".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/nyregion/a-tangle-of-interests-behind-cuomos-1-billion-boon-for-buffalo.html|title=$1 Billion Went to Buffalo.

On April 29, 2016, then-[[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York|U.S. Attorney]] [[Preet Bharara]] (of the Southern District of New York) began an investigation into state construction projects and contracts. Buffalo Billion was a part of that investigation. Many companies have been subpoenaed, and have provided information, including SolarCity and the office of New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]]. SolarCity is not the subject or focus of the investigation, and not involved in the vendor selection or contracting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/region-state/solar-company-acknowledges-receiving-subpoena-in-federal-probe-1.11793411|title=Solar firm acknowledges subpoena in probe|last=Harrington|first=Mark|date=2016-05-12|website=Newsday|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York is leading a federal inquiry into Buffalo Billion. Prosecutors subpoenaed several state institutions who were responsible for SolarCity and other components of the Buffalo Billion project. The subpoenas sought information about how government-funded programs were awarded and what the role was of state officials who selected the winners. Cuomo has strongly defended the project noting that there has been a decrease in unemployment and an increase in spending around the Buffalo area.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

In February, three executives who worked for LPCiminelli Development who were arrested in 2016 in a federal bid-rigging investigation motioned to have the case against them either dismissed or moved from Manhattan to Buffalo. The three men face a 14-count indictment for [[mail and wire fraud|wire fraud]] and [[bribery]] and alleged [[bid rigging]] of the SolarCity RiverBend construction contract. Additionally, five other people have been charged with related crimes. The trials will begin in late spring of 2017.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

An Albany firm called Whitman Osterman and Hannah represented both LPCiminelli and Fort Schuyler Management Corporation, which was a subsidiary of SUNY Polytechnic that was awarded the contract to develop the site where SolarCity is being built. The governor's office said that the formal awarding of the SolarCity contract was made by Fort Schuyler on behalf of the state. On May 18, 2016, the Public Authorities Control Board delayed a meeting at which it was set to approve $485 million in new funds for SolarCity. As late as May 2016 SolarCity said that it was cooperating with federal agents who had been in contact with the company.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

The New York state legislature plans to approve a budget by April 1, 2017 that would give $500 million more into the Buffalo Billion program. In return, the legislature wants the Cuomo administration to put more transparency into how the money is spent.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;&lt;!-- without more than this source provides, it is unclear why this is even relevant to an article on SolarCity --&gt;

===Oregon Attorney General investigation===
On March 30, 2017, ''[[The Oregonian]]'' said that [[Campaign for Accountability]], a D.C.-based consumer advocacy group, and other groups have asked Oregon Attorney General [[Ellen Rosenblum]] to investigate solar panel sales practices&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/31/solar-group-wants-oregon-ag-to-investigate-sales-p/|title=Solar: Group wants Oregon AG to investigate sales practices|last=|first=|date=2017-03-31|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "are designed to trick homeowners into buying or leasing solar panels" in violation of Oregon's Unlawful Trade Practices Act.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2017/03/consumer_group_asks_state_to_i.html |title=Consumer group asks state to investigate solar companies' sales practices|last=Sickinger|first=Ted |date=2017-03-30 |work=OregonLive.com|access-date=2017-04-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Oregonian'', the request to Rosenblum "singled out one company: California-based SolarCity. It outlined several complaints filed against the solar giant by Oregonians who claimed they'd been misled about costs, tax credits and energy savings by the company."&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

The Campaign for Accountability reviewed 58 complaints that consumers filed with the [[Oregon Department of Justice]] and said that the complaints indicated "a widespread pattern of apparent fraud and abuse by solar companies".&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt; The Oregon Solar Energy Industry Association, however, said that it examined the complaints and "found the numbers to be relatively low – lower than those being cited by the Campaign for Accountability".&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

==="Solar by Degree" project===
The company is involved in a case concerning Martin Shain, the lead energy consultant in a solar power project at two Oregon universities. Shain was indicted for forgery in Marion County in August 2016. He is a consultant for BacGen Technologies in Seattle, a key player in the controversial $24 million "Solar by Degree" project and is accused of "creating a phony invoice from a fictional subcontractor that was pivotal in getting nearly $12 million in tax credits from the Oregon Department of Energy".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2016/08/consultant_to_university_solar.html|title=Consultant to university solar project charged with forgery|last=Manning|first=Jeff|date=2016-08-29|work=The Oregonian|newspaper=|access-date=2016-11-07|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project began in 2013 and was sponsored by the [[Oregon University System]]; thousands of solar panels, generating millions of kilowatts of power per year, were constructed on 21 acres on the campuses of [[Oregon State University]] and the [[Oregon Institute of Technology, Klamath Falls|Oregon Institute of Technology]] in Klamath Falls.

The state's case revolves around two documents, which include an invoice from Solar Foundations Systems dated February 25, 2011, and a December 2011 letter signed by Ryan Davies, the former head of RedCo, a Utah-based company, which was the second developer on the project. According to [[KOIN|KOIN-TV]], "The Davies letter reported $210,000 had been spent toward the project and that construction was progressing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koin.com/2016/08/30/solar-project-consultant-charged-with-fraud-in-oregon/|title=Solar project consultant charged with fraud in Oregon|last=|first=|date=2016-08-30|website=KOIN 6|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Solar Foundations invoice contains details of the construction of solar arrays. The invoice was necessary to provide proof of work on the project to get tax credits from the state. The "Solar by Degree" project received the tax credits, but it was later shown that the company named on the invoice, Solar Foundations, does not exist. In addition, Davies claims he did not write nor has ever seen the RedCo letter in question and that his name was forged. Relying on this evidence, the state claims Shain forged both documents. Shain denies forging the invoice and claims it was given to him by someone else involved in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/30/solar-project-consultant-charged-with-fraud-in-ore/|title=Solar project consultant charged with fraud in Oregon|last=|first=|date=2016-08-30|work=|newspaper=The Washington Times|access-date=2016-11-07|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax credits involved were given to SolarCity, the third developer in the project, along with its financial backers. According to ''The Oregonian'', "Those backers provide upfront financing for the projects in exchange for a share of the project revenues and the federal and state tax credits, which they can use to offset their own taxes."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; SolarCity stated, "We financed and constructed the projects in accord with the requirements of the Oregon Department of Energy."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The company argues that the state hired Shain, and it had no knowledge of the phony documents in question, otherwise it would have not pursued the endeavor.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

===Treasury Department inquiries===
In 2012, the Treasury Department began investigative interviews of solar firms regarding their fair market value calculations for constructed solar energy systems. The IRS has yet to determine whether or not these values have been inflated. In a 2016 federal filing, SolarCity wrote, "If the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Treasury Department were to object to amounts we have claimed as too high of a fair market value on such systems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects." The firm stated, however, that its values were correct and complied with the Treasury Department guidelines. If the Treasury Department or IRS disagrees, SolarCity and other firms could be forced to reimburse institutions that purchase their tax credits as investments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-probe-tax-incentives-received-by-solar-energy-firms-1473967056|title=Lawmakers Probe Tax Incentives Received by Solar-Energy Firms|last=Mullins|first=Brody|date=2016-09-15|last2=Dugan|first2=Ianthe Jeanne|newspaper=Wall Street Journal |issn=0099-9660|last3=Rubin|first3=Richard|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SolarCity received roughly $501.2 million in credits up until December 31, 2015. In SolarCity's 2015 annual report, a note was made stating that if the government determines misrepresentations were made, "the Department of Justice could bring a civil action to recover amounts it believes were improperly paid to us".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

===Customer litigation===
Since 2006, SolarCity has lowered the minimum [[FICO]] score required for customers to get the leasing deals. It uses the score of 650 (a "fair" [[credit rating]]) as the cutoff. However, between 2014 and 2017, SolarCity signed long-term lease agreements with at least 14 homeowner customers right before the customers [[foreclosure|defaulted on their mortgages]]. The company has been named in 139 lawsuits where it is the defendant in legal proceedings based on "residential foreclosure action".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/business/solarcity-foreclosure-cases.html|title=SolarCity’s Ties to Foreclosure Cases Raise Questions on Vetting Policies|last=Ivory|first=Danielle|date=2017-02-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-17|last2=Cardwell |first2=Diane |issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its response, SolarCity said in a statement to the ''New York Times'', "Out of more than 305,000 installed customers, SolarCity is currently involved in 139 such proceedings. The litigation is not adversarial – being named in the foreclosure proceeding provides us with advance notice that we need to reassign a contract, and many are immediately resolved with the relevant bank."&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;

===Customer cancellation investigation===
The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) began investigating [[Sunrun]] and SolarCity in May 2017, and were looking into whether they adequately disclosed canceled contracts. "Some customers say they canceled contracts after being strong-armed into solar-energy deals" and there have been hundreds of complaints to state attorneys general.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-probes-solar-companies-over-disclosure-of-customer-cancellations-1493803801 |title=SEC Probes Solar Companies Over Disclosure of Customer Cancellations|last=Grind|first=Kirsten |date=2017-05-03 |work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-05-05 |issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government is investigating whether solar companies are "masking how many customers they are losing". The SEC is involved because "investors use that cancellation metric as one way to gauge the companies' health".&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt; According to the ''Wall Street Journal'', "To generate business, solar companies have long relied on thousands of salespeople who knock on doors, make hundreds of cold calls and even trail people as they shop at retailers like Home Depot Inc., according to salespeople, executives and homeowners."&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

{{quote|Some customers say they were strong-armed into buying solar-energy systems by sales representatives who threatened to sue them if they didn't proceed with a project or to place a so-called mechanic's lien on their homes—a measure used to force a homeowner to pay for a home-improvement project. Others say they didn't realize they had actually signed contracts."&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;}}

=== FCC receiving radio interference complaints ===
SolarCity installed SolarEdge inverter systems with a type of DC-DC converter called an optimizer. These systems cause radio interference as documented in April 2016 QST magazine a publication of the ARRL ( American Radio Relay League ).

===Federal settlement for allegations of False Claims Act violations===
In September 2017, as part of a legal settlement with the federal government, SolarCity agreed to pay a $29.5 million penalty regarding allegations that the company overstated the cost of facilities it developed and submitted claims for under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which would be a violation of the False Claims Act. SolarCity dropped its lawsuit, ''Sequoia Pacific Solar I, LLC v. United States''—in which the company alleged the federal government owed it more money—as part of the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.utilitydive.com/news/solarcity-to-pay-295m-to-settle-false-claims-allegations/505914/|title=SolarCity to pay $29.5M to settle false claims allegations|last=Walton|first=Robert|date=September 27, 2017|website=Utility Dive|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the settlement, the company agreed to “release all pending and future claims against the U.S. for additional payments from the grant program". The move ended a five-year investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dailyenergyinsider.com/news/8079-teslas-solarcity-settles-alleged-fraud-claims-federal-government/|title=Tesla’s SolarCity settles alleged fraud claims with federal government|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2017-09-25|work=Daily Energy Insider|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vermont projects without approval===
In June 2017 the [[Vermont Public Service Board]] found that SolarCity was implementing solar projects in Vermont without approval required by law. According to Vermont Public Radio, Public Service Board Chair Anthony Roisman sent a letter to SolarCity warning the company that it needed to get regulatory approval before installing solar generation equipment and attaching it to the state's electrical grid. Roisman wrote, "Over the past few months, my office has observed a pattern of procedural issues with net-metering applications being pursued by your company." Officials at the company worked quickly to respond to the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://digital.vpr.net/post/state-says-solarcity-wasnt-following-permit-process#stream/0|title=State Says SolarCity Wasn't Following Permit Process|last=Dobbs|first=Taylor|date=2017-06-30|work=Vermont Public Radio (VPR)|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faked sales numbers===
In July 2018, former employees filed a lawsuit against SolarCity, alleging that the corporation had approved the creation of "fake sales accounts", which resulted in an "unreasonably high valuation of SolarCity" for investors.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/07/3-ex-solarcity-employees-claim-company-oversaw-bogus-sales-to-inflate-valuation/|title=Ex-SolarCity employees: We were fired after reporting millions in fake sales|last=Farivar|first=Cyrus|date=2018-07-31|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ex-solarcity-workers-sue-tesla-claiming-it-inflated-sales-with-fake-accounts-2018-07-31|title=Ex-SolarCity workers sue Tesla, claiming it inflated sales with fake accounts|last=Assis|first=Claudia|date=2018-08-01|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After informing management, including CEO Elon Musk, of these incidents, the employees were fired, which they argue contravenes California's whistleblower protection laws. A Tesla spokesman has so far denied these allegations.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

===Walmart lawsuit===
SolarCity installed and manages solar panels on the roofs of more than 240 Walmart stores. On August 21, 2019, Walmart filed a lawsuit against Tesla, seeking reimbursement for millions of dollars in damages and release from contracts, claiming that fires on the roofs of seven of those stores since 2012 were caused by SolarCity's "negligent installation and maintenance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=After seven roof fires, Walmart sues Tesla over solar panel flaws|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/after-seven-roof-fires-walmart-sues-tesla-over-solar-panel-flaws/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 5 November 2019 it was announced that Walmart Inc has agreed to settle its legal dispute accusing Tesla Inc of negligence in the installation of solar panels atop hundreds of its stores, resulting in at least seven fires. A joint statement provided by Tesla stated the companies said they were "pleased to have resolved the issues raised by Walmart" concerning the installations, and looked forward to "a safe re-energization of our sustainable energy systems." Walmart had sued Tesla for breach of contract on Aug. 20 in a New York state court in Manhattan, seeking to have its solar panels removed from more than 240 stores. Walmart had accused Tesla of “widespread, systematic negligence” and ignoring prudent industry practices by relying on untrained and unsupervised personnel to install and maintain its panels, and prioritizing speed and profit over safety. Tesla's solar panel market share has been falling, prompting the Palo Alto, California-based company to cut its sales force. Revenue from Tesla's energy generation and storage operations from January to September fell 7% from a year earlier to $1.1 billion. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. Walmart had no immediate additional comment. Tesla and its respective lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-walmart-tesla-solar-lawsuit-idUSKBN1XF240|title=Tesla settles with Walmart over solar panel installations, fires|date=2019-11-05|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Checks and Balances Project==
SolarCity indirectly funds a political advocacy group known as the Checks and Balances Project. The project has criticized the elected members of the [[Arizona Corporation Commission]] (the regulatory body that oversees electricity and utilities in Arizona) for being too well-connected to utility companies. The Checks and Balances Project has filed several requests for public records from the Arizona Corporation Commission. In July 2016, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] interviewed the head of Checks and Balances as part of a larger criminal investigation into the financing of certain Arizona statewide races in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/energy/2016/07/06/fbi-questions-clean-energy-advocacy-group-az-corporation-commission-inquiry/86757378/|title=Advocacy group briefs FBI in Arizona Corporation Commission inquiry|last=|first=|date=2016-07-06|website=Arizona Republic|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, SolarCity announced plans to build a new manufacturing facility in [[Buffalo, New York]], in coordination with the [[SUNY Polytechnic Institute]] after acquiring Silevo, a maker of high-efficiency solar modules. The initial manufacturing complex would be a {{convert|1.2|e6sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility that would cost $900 million and employ 1,500 workers in Buffalo and 5,000 statewide.&lt;ref name="Buffalo News August 2016"&gt;{{cite news |last=Robinson |first=David |title=SolarCity construction nears completion |url=http://buffalonews.com/2016/08/26/solarcity-construction-nears-completion/ |newspaper=[[The Buffalo News]] |date=August 26, 2016|accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a planned capacity of one gigawatt of solar panels annually by 2019, the new plant would be the largest solar plant in the U.S.&lt;ref name="WSJ_Silevo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gold |first1=Russel |title=SolarCity Buys Silevo, a Module Maker |url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/solarcity-to-acquire-solar-module-maker-silevo-1403017005 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=2014-06-19 |date=June 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619040411/http://online.wsj.com/articles/solarcity-to-acquire-solar-module-maker-silevo-1403017005 |archivedate=June 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundbreaking for the project occurred in September 2014 with a target completion date of early 2016.&lt;ref name="WIVB SolarCity"&gt;{{cite news |title=SolarCity investing $5B in Buffalo, creating 3,000 jobs |url=http://wivb.com/2014/09/23/solarcity-investing-5b-in-buffalo-creating-3000-jobs/ |publisher=LIN Television Corporation |accessdate=2014-09-24 |date=September 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004032429/http://wivb.com/2014/09/23/solarcity-investing-5b-in-buffalo-creating-3000-jobs/ |archivedate=October 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
