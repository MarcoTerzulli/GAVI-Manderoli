'''George Albert''' "'''Scotty'''" '''Bowers''' (July 1, 1923 – October 13, 2019) was an American who was a [[United States Marine]] and, from the 1940s to the 1980s, a Hollywood [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]].&lt;ref name="vidal"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Teeman |first1=Tim |title=In Bed with Gore Vidal: Hustlers, Hollywood, and the Private World of an American Master |date=2013 |publisher=Magnus Books |isbn=978-1-62601-041-3 |page=38 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA"&gt;{{cite news |last=Teetor |first=Paul |title=The apparently true story of the man who secured gay lovers for Old Hollywood |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=March 19, 2012 |url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/the-apparently-true-story-of-the-man-who-secured-gay-lovers-for-old-hollywood-2372317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.themarysue.com/interview-women-hes-undressed-director-gillian-armstrong/ | title=Interview: ''Women He's Undressed'' Director Gillian Armstrong | first=Leslie | last=Coffin | date=November 17, 2015 | website=TheMarySue.com | access-date=January 18, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/hed-article-1.2384188 | title=In new tell-all, 'Make 'Em Laugh', Debbie Reynolds says Milton Berle and Bob Hope were Hollywood's biggest playboys | date=October 4, 2015 | work=[[New York Daily News]] | access-date=January 18, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories of his exploits circulated for many years&lt;ref name="Blakely"&gt;{{cite news |last=Blakely |first=Rhys |title=Mr Sex Scotty Bowers' memoirs to lift the lid on Hollywood's debauched underbelly |work=[[The Australian]] |date=February 11, 2012 |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/mr-sex-scotty-bowers-memoirs-to-lift-the-lid-on-hollywoods-debauched-underbelly/story-e6frg6so-1226268137889}}
Requires subscription&lt;/ref&gt; and were alluded to in books such as ''[[Hollywood Babylon]]''. Bowers’ claims were met with both praise and skepticism.

Bowers decided to talk publicly about his life when most of the people involved were dead and, in his words, "The truth can’t hurt them anymore."&lt;ref name="Barnes NY Times" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WI Gz" /&gt; In 2012, the publication of his memoir ''[[Full Service (book)|Full Service]]'', written by [[Lionel Friedberg]] from 150 hours of interviews,&lt;ref name="Bowers" /&gt; drew publicity, including a profile in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="Barnes NY Times" /&gt; and a feature on ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]''.&lt;ref name="CBS" /&gt; One journalist wrote, "He has a savant-like quality: a result of his refusal to be embarrassed by sex."&lt;ref name="Blakely" /&gt;

== Life and career ==
Bowers was born in Ottawa, Illinois, the son of Edna (Ostrander) and Glen Bowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

In 1950 Bowers stopped working at the service station and began working as a party bartender, while continuing his sexual services. He also claimed to have provided women, mostly prostitutes, to [[Alfred Kinsey]] as interview subjects for his [[Kinsey Reports|study on human sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bowers |first1=Scotty |last2=Friedberg |first2=Lionel |title=Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Lives of the Stars |date=2012 |publisher=Grove Press |isbn=978-0-8021-9476-3 |page=173–178 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowers was never prosecuted by the authorities for his activities; he kept all his contact information in his head.&lt;ref name="Barnes NY Times" /&gt; The actor [[Beach Dickerson]] willed three houses to Bowers&lt;ref name="Debruge"&gt;{{cite news | last=Debruge  | first=Peter | title=Bartender To Babylon | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=June 22, 2006 | url= https://variety.com/2006/film/features/bartender-to-babylon-1200337270/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his autobiography, Bowers claimed that cinematographer [[Néstor Almendros]] bequeathed him his Oscar.&lt;ref name="Debruge" /&gt;

In 1984, he married cabaret singer Lois Broad, ten years his junior. She died in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ScottyBowers/status/1050867449170550784|title=My wife Lois Broad Bowers, died this week. I'll miss her and her beautiful voice.

== Support of claims ==
According to film critic Peter Debruge, writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in 2006: "Everyone knows Scotty. After all, he’s been serving drinks to the [[Beverly Hills]] crowd for almost 60 years, working a different party almost every night of the week, sometimes two a day."&lt;ref name="Debruge"/&gt; [[Gore Vidal]], maintaining Bowers' account was accurate,&lt;ref name="Walters" /&gt; spoke at the official launch of the memoir; it was Vidal's last public appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/02/gore-vidal-remembered-by-his-closest-friend-scotty-bowers.html | title= Gore Vidal Remembered By His Closest Friend, Scotty Bowers | date = August 2, 2012 | accessdate = April 2, 2016 | work= The Daily Beast | first = Scotty | last = Bowers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Benevides, the partner of actor [[Raymond Burr]], said to the ''[[LA Weekly]]'': "Scotty just liked to make people happy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/the-apparently-true-story-of-the-man-who-secured-gay-lovers-for-old-hollywood-2372317|title=The Apparently True Story of the Man Who Secured Gay Lovers for Old Hollywood|last=Teetor|first=Paul|website=L.A. Weekly|access-date=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film director [[John Schlesinger]] and investigative reporter and novelist [[Dominick Dunne]] also backed Bowers’ claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Teeman |first1=Tim |title=In Bed with Gore Vidal: Hustlers, Hollywood, and the Private World of an American Master |date=2013 |publisher=Magnus Books |isbn=978-1-62601-041-3 |page=72 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joan Allemand, a former arts director of the Beverly Hills Unified School District, who knew Bowers for more than 20 years and introduced him to his subsequent co-writer, Lionel Friedberg, said: "Scotty doesn't lie about anything. He's a poor kid from a farm in Illinois, and when he got here, his two assets were his big penis and charming personality. That's what he used to feed his family."&lt;ref name="LA"/&gt; Sir [[Cecil Beaton]] wrote of his sexual encounters with Bowers in his published diary of the 1960s,&lt;ref name="Beaton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Beaton |first= Cecil |title=Beaton in the Sixties: The Cecil Beaton Dailies as He Wrote Them, 1965–1969 |publisher= Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |date=2003  |page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Debbie Reynolds]] wrote in her memoirs of [[Milton Berle]] employing him for a party prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds |first= Debbie |title=Make 'Em Laugh: Short-Term Memories of Longtime Friends |publisher= William Morrow |date= 2015 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowers appears in [[John Rechy]]'s 1963 [[roman-à-clef]] ''City of Night'' as the character 'Smitty'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rechy |first1=John |title=City of Night |date=2011 |publisher=Profile |isbn=978-0-285-63989-8 |pages=70–73 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WSqGDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A profile in the  ''[[New York Social Diary]]'' stated: "Clients all agreed that he was 'very good' at what he did, and very agreeable... And very discreet. He did not discriminate. He even had one regular longtime client... who had no arms and no legs... The Scotty I knew was a guy who always seemed to be enjoying his life working morning, noon and night, with never a gripe; always with a smile to greet you, and never with an axe to grind. After a lifetime in Hollywood, that's a remarkable feat and its own kind of [[Zen]]."&lt;ref&gt;cite web| url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/social-diary/2012/its-own-kind-of-zen |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008062944/http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/social-diary/2012/its-own-kind-of-zen |title=Its own kind of zen |publisher=[[New York Social Diary]] |date=January 30, 2012|archive-date=October 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that Bowers' claims were dismissed by some not simply because "virtually everyone he talks about has died", but because "many in the industry still cling to a prudish, homophobic and manufactured version of the past."&lt;ref name=atkinson&gt;{{cite news|last=Atkinson |first=Nathalie |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/awards-and-festivals/tiff/tiff-2017-scotty-bowers-throws-hollywoods-closet-wide-open/article36262323/ |title=Scotty Bowers throws Hollywood's closet wide open |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Matt Tyrnauer]], director of a documentary on Bowers, it is merely proof of "the enduring power of the (Hollywood) myth machine... created there—by outsiders, Jewish immigrants themselves who were furriers and glove manufacturers projecting a lie of a made-up image of white Americanism... I think there are a lot of people who want to cling to that."&lt;ref name=atkinson/&gt;

Author William J. Mann, who interviewed Bowers for a biography of [[Katharine Hepburn]], said, "I found him forthright and honest and not interested in personal fame or gain." At that time he turned down Mann's offer to write about him or introduce him to a literary agent.&lt;ref name=teeman&gt;{{cite news|last=Teeman |first=Tim |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-gore-vidal-loved-scotty-bowers-hollywoods-best-known-pimp-who-fixed-him-up-with-rock-hudson |title=Why Gore Vidal Loved Scotty Bowers, Hollywood's Best-Known Pimp Who Fixed Him Up With Rock Hudson |newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]] |date=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and journalist Tim Teeman, who also interviewed Bowers, wrote that "as candid as Bowers was, he was also respectful, and when it came to sex and sexuality utterly without shame and judgment."&lt;ref name=teeman/&gt;

== Other writings and appearances ==
Bowers authored the introduction to a collection of archival photographs of male affection in the military, ''My Buddy: World War II Laid Bare''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WWII and the Buddy System |magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |url=http://www.advocate.com/photography/2016/3/11/wwii-and-buddy-system |access-date=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Hansen |editor-first=Diane |last=Bowers |first=Scotty |title=My Buddy: World War II Laid Bare |publisher=[[Taschen]] |year=2015 |chapter=Introduction |pages=319 |chapter-url= |isbn=9783836547963}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 he wrote a profile of himself for the ''[[Guest of a Guest]]'' blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://guestofaguest.com/los-angeles/you-should-know/you-should-know-scotty-bowers |title=You Should Know: Scotty Bowers |work=[[Guest of a Guest]] |first=Christie |last=Grimm |date=17 March 2016 |access-date=12 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also appears in Sir [[Cecil Beaton]]'s published diary for the 1960s, Beaton terming him "a phenomenon",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beaton |first=Cecil |title=Beaton in the Sixties: The Cecil Beaton Diaries as He Wrote Them, 1965–1969 |publisher=[[Alfred A.

Bowers is the subject of the documentary ''[[Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood]]'' (2017), directed by Matt Tyrnauer. In ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', its reviewer commented: "At a certain point, anyone who reads Bowers’ book or sees this film has to decide whether to believe him or not. At this stage, there is no reason not to; Scotty does not seem remotely like a braggart or someone desperate for a sliver of late-in-life fame... When Scotty says he likes to make people happy, he clearly includes himself, and that he seems to have done in spades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |title='Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood': Film Review {{!}} TIFF 2017 |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=September 9, 2017 |access-date=March 13, 2018 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/scotty-secret-history-hollywood-review-1037277}}&lt;/ref&gt;
