[[File:DNA methylation.jpg|thumb|300px|Representation of a [[DNA]] molecule that is methylated. The two white spheres represent [[methyl group]]s. They are bound to two [[cytosine]] [[nucleotide]] molecules that make up the DNA sequence. ]]

'''DNA methylation''' is a biological process by which [[methyl group]]s are added to the [[DNA]] molecule. Methylation can change the activity of a DNA segment without changing the sequence. When located in a gene [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]], DNA methylation typically acts to repress gene [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. In mammals, DNA methylation is essential for normal development and is associated with a number of key processes including [[genomic imprinting]], [[X-chromosome inactivation]], repression of [[transposable element]]s, [[aging]], and [[carcinogenesis]].

Two of DNA's four bases, [[cytosine]] and [[adenine]], can be methylated. Cytosine methylation is widespread in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, even though the rate of cytosine DNA methylation can differ greatly between species: 14% of cytosines are methylated in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'', 4 to 8% in ''[[Physarum]]'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Evans HH, Evans TE|date=10 December 1970|title=Methylation of the deoxyribonucleic acid of ''Physarum polycephalum'' at various periods during the mitotic cycle|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/245/23/6436.long|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=245|issue=23|page=6440|pmid=5530731|via=}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7.6% in ''[[Mus musculus]]'', 2.3% in ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', 0.03% in ''[[Drosophila]]'', 0.006% in ''[[Dictyostelium]]''&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite biorxiv|biorxiv=10.1101/166033|title=Whole genome bisulfite sequencing reveals a sparse, but robust pattern of DNA methylation in the Dictyostelium discoideum genome|vauthors=Steenwyk,JL, St-Denis,J, Dresch,J, Larochelle,D, Drewell,RA|year=2017}}(Information found in abstract)&lt;/ref&gt; and virtually none (0.0002 to 0.0003%) in ''[[Caenorhabditis]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Hu CW, Chen JL, Hsu YW, Yen CC, Chao MR|date=January 2015|title=Trace analysis of methylated and hydroxymethylated cytosines in DNA by isotope-dilution LC-MS/MS: first evidence of DNA methylation in Caenorhabditis elegans|url=https://portlandpress.com/biochemj/article-abstract/465/1/39/48366/Trace-analysis-of-methylated-and-hydroxymethylated|journal=The Biochemical Journal|volume=465|issue=1|page=39 (abstract)|doi=10.1042/bj20140844|pmid=25299492|url-access=subscription|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or yeast species such as ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[S. pombe]]'' (but not ''[[N. crassa]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bird|first=Adrian|date=7 December 2001|title=Methylation Talk Between Histones and DNA|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d3b4/05e0e51aebbc203ac386cd23ceb051624497.pdf|department=Science's Compass|journal=Science|volume=294|pages=2114|quote=As a result of this process, known as repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), the wild-type ''Neurospora'' genome contains a small fraction of methylated DNA, the majority of the DNA remaining nonmethylated.|via=[[Semantic Scholar]]}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24640988&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Capuano F, Mülleder M, Kok R, Blom HJ, Ralser M | title = Cytosine DNA methylation is found in Drosophila melanogaster but absent in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and other yeast species | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 86 | issue = 8 | pages = 3697–702 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24640988 | pmc = 4006885 | doi = 10.1021/ac500447w }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|3699}} Adenine methylation has been observed in bacterial, plant, and recently in mammalian DNA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ratel D, Ravanat JL, Berger F, Wion D | title = N6-methyladenine: the other methylated base of DNA | journal = BioEssays | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–15 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16479578 | pmc = 2754416 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu TP, Wang T, Seetin MG, Lai Y, Zhu S, Lin K, Liu Y, Byrum SD, Mackintosh SG, Zhong M, Tackett A, Wang G, Hon LS, Fang G, Swenberg JA, Xiao AZ | title = DNA methylation on N(6)-adenine in mammalian embryonic stem cells | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7599 | pages = 329–33 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27027282 | pmc = 4977844 | doi = 10.1038/nature17640 | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..329W }}&lt;/ref&gt; but has received considerably less attention.

Methylation of cytosine to form [[5-methylcytosine]] occurs at the same 5 position on the [[pyrimidine]] ring where the DNA base [[thymine]]'s methyl group is located; the same position distinguishes thymine from the analogous RNA base [[uracil]], which has no methyl group. Spontaneous [[deamination]] of [[5-methylcytosine]] converts it to thymine. This results in a T:G mismatch. Repair mechanisms then correct it back to the original C:G pair; alternatively, they may substitute A for G, turning the original C:G pair into a T:A pair, effectively changing a base and introducing a mutation. This misincorporated base will not be corrected during DNA replication as thymine is a DNA base. If the mismatch is not repaired and the cell enters the cell cycle the strand carrying the T will be complemented by an A in one of the daughter cells, such that the mutation becomes permanent. The near-universal [[Uracil in DNA|replacement of uracil by thymine]] in DNA, but not RNA, may have evolved as an error-control mechanism, to facilitate the removal of uracils generated by the spontaneous deamination of cytosine.&lt;ref&gt;Angéla Békési and Beáta G Vértessy [http://www.scienceinschool.org/2011/issue18/uracil  "Uracil in DNA: error or signal?"]&lt;/ref&gt;  DNA methylation as well as many of its contemporary DNA methyltransferases have been thought to evolve from early world primitive RNA methylation activity and is supported by several lines of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rana AK, Ankri S | title = Reviving the RNA World: An Insight into the Appearance of RNA Methyltransferases | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 7 | pages = 99 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27375676 | pmc = 4893491 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2016.00099 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plants and other organisms, 'DNA' methylation is found in three different sequence contexts: CG (or [[CpG site|CpG]]), CHG or CHH (where H correspond to A, T or C). In mammals however, DNA methylation is almost exclusively found in CpG dinucleotides, with the cytosines on both strands being usually methylated.

[[File:DNAme landscape.png|thumb|458x458px|Typical DNA methylation landscape in mammals]]
The DNA methylation landscape of vertebrates is very particular compared to other organisms.

High CpG methylation in mammalian genomes has an evolutionary cost because it increases the frequency of spontaneous mutations. Loss of amino-groups occurs with a high frequency for cytosines, with different consequences depending on their methylation. Methylated C residues spontaneously deaminate to form T residues over time; hence CpG dinucleotides steadily deaminate to TpG dinucleotides, which is evidenced by the under-representation of CpG dinucleotides in the human genome (they occur at only 21% of the expected frequency).&lt;ref name="Human Genome Sequencing and Analysis"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lander ES, Linton LM, Birren B, Nusbaum C, Zody MC, Baldwin J, Devon K, Dewar K, Doyle M, FitzHugh W, Funke R, Gage D, Harris K, Heaford A, Howland J, Kann L, Lehoczky J, LeVine R, McEwan P, McKernan K, Meldrim J, Mesirov JP, Miranda C, Morris W, Naylor J, Raymond C, Rosetti M, Santos R, Sheridan A, Sougnez C, Stange-Thomann Y, Stojanovic N, Subramanian A, Wyman D, Rogers J, Sulston J, Ainscough R, Beck S, Bentley D, Burton J, Clee C, Carter N, Coulson A, Deadman R, Deloukas P, Dunham A, Dunham I, Durbin R, French L, Grafham D, Gregory S, Hubbard T, Humphray S, Hunt A, Jones M, Lloyd C, McMurray A, Matthews L, Mercer S, Milne S, Mullikin JC, Mungall A, Plumb R, Ross M, Shownkeen R, Sims S, Waterston RH, Wilson RK, Hillier LW, McPherson JD, Marra MA, Mardis ER, Fulton LA, Chinwalla AT, Pepin KH, Gish WR, Chissoe SL, Wendl MC, Delehaunty KD, Miner TL, Delehaunty A, Kramer JB, Cook LL, Fulton RS, Johnson DL, Minx PJ, Clifton SW, Hawkins T, Branscomb E, Predki P, Richardson P, Wenning S, Slezak T, Doggett N, Cheng JF, Olsen A, Lucas S, Elkin C, Uberbacher E, Frazier M, Gibbs RA, Muzny DM, Scherer SE, Bouck JB, Sodergren EJ, Worley KC, Rives CM, Gorrell JH, Metzker ML, Naylor SL, Kucherlapati RS, Nelson DL, Weinstock GM, Sakaki Y, Fujiyama A, Hattori M, Yada T, Toyoda A, Itoh T, Kawagoe C, Watanabe H, Totoki Y, Taylor T, Weissenbach J, Heilig R, Saurin W, Artiguenave F, Brottier P, Bruls T, Pelletier E, Robert C, Wincker P, Smith DR, Doucette-Stamm L, Rubenfield M, Weinstock K, Lee HM, Dubois J, Rosenthal A, Platzer M, Nyakatura G, Taudien S, Rump A, Yang H, Yu J, Wang J, Huang G, Gu J, Hood L, Rowen L, Madan A, Qin S, Davis RW, Federspiel NA, Abola AP, Proctor MJ, Myers RM, Schmutz J, Dickson M, Grimwood J, Cox DR, Olson MV, Kaul R, Raymond C, Shimizu N, Kawasaki K, Minoshima S, Evans GA, Athanasiou M, Schultz R, Roe BA, Chen F, Pan H, Ramser J, Lehrach H, Reinhardt R, McCombie WR, de la Bastide M, Dedhia N, Blöcker H, Hornischer K, Nordsiek G, Agarwala R, Aravind L, Bailey JA, Bateman A, Batzoglou S, Birney E, Bork P, Brown DG, Burge CB, Cerutti L, Chen HC, Church D, Clamp M, Copley RR, Doerks T, Eddy SR, Eichler EE, Furey TS, Galagan J, Gilbert JG, Harmon C, Hayashizaki Y, Haussler D, Hermjakob H, Hokamp K, Jang W, Johnson LS, Jones TA, Kasif S, Kaspryzk A, Kennedy S, Kent WJ, Kitts P, Koonin EV, Korf I, Kulp D, Lancet D, Lowe TM, McLysaght A, Mikkelsen T, Moran JV, Mulder N, Pollara VJ, Ponting CP, Schuler G, Schultz J, Slater G, Smit AF, Stupka E, Szustakowki J, Thierry-Mieg D, Thierry-Mieg J, Wagner L, Wallis J, Wheeler R, Williams A, Wolf YI, Wolfe KH, Yang SP, Yeh RF, Collins F, Guyer MS, Peterson J, Felsenfeld A, Wetterstrand KA, Patrinos A, Morgan MJ, de Jong P, Catanese JJ, Osoegawa K, Shizuya H, Choi S, Chen YJ, Szustakowki J | display-authors = 6 | title = Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6822 | pages = 860–921 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11237011 | doi = 10.1038/35057062 | bibcode = 2001Natur.409..860L | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; (On the other hand, spontaneous deamination of unmethylated C residues gives rise to U residues, a change that is quickly recognized and repaired by the cell.)

=== CpG islands ===

In mammals, the only exception for this global CpG depletion resides in a specific category of GC- and CpG-rich sequences termed CpG islands that are generally unmethylated and therefore retained the expected CpG content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Adrian Bird| author = Bird AP | title = CpG-rich islands and the function of DNA methylation | journal = Nature | volume = 321 | issue = 6067 | pages = 209–13 | date = 1986-05-15 | pmid = 2423876 | doi = 10.1038/321209a0 | bibcode = 1986Natur.321..209B }}&lt;/ref&gt; CpG islands are usually defined as regions with 1) a length greater than 200bp, 2) a G+C content greater than 50%, 3) a ratio of observed to expected CpG greater than 0.6, although other definitions are sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gardiner-Garden M, Frommer M | title = CpG islands in vertebrate genomes | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 196 | issue = 2 | pages = 261–82 | date = July 1987 | pmid = 3656447 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(87)90689-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excluding repeated sequences, there are around 25,000 CpG islands in the human genome, 75% of which being less than 850bp long.&lt;ref name="Human Genome Sequencing and Analysis" /&gt; They are major regulatory units and around 50% of CpG islands are located in gene promoter regions, while another 25% lie in gene bodies, often serving as alternative promoters.

In somatic tissues, only 10% of CpG islands are methylated, the majority of them being located in intergenic and intragenic regions.

=== Repression of CpG-dense promoters ===

DNA methylation was probably present at some extent in very early eukaryote ancestors. In virtually every organism analyzed, methylation in promoter regions correlates negatively with gene expression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feng S, Cokus SJ, Zhang X, Chen PY, Bostick M, Goll MG, Hetzel J, Jain J, Strauss SH, Halpern ME, Ukomadu C, Sadler KC, Pradhan S, Pellegrini M, Jacobsen SE | title = Conservation and divergence of methylation patterning in plants and animals | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 19 | pages = 8689–94 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20395551 | pmc = 2889301 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1002720107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CpG-dense promoters of actively transcribed genes are never methylated, but, reciprocally, transcriptionally silent genes do not necessarily carry a methylated promoter.

DNA methylation may affect the transcription of genes in two ways. First, the methylation of DNA itself may physically impede the binding of [[transcription factor|transcriptional proteins]] to the gene,&lt;ref name="pmid20875111"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Choy MK, Movassagh M, Goh HG, Bennett MR, Down TA, Foo RS | title = Genome-wide conserved consensus transcription factor binding motifs are hyper-methylated | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 519 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20875111 | pmc = 2997012 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-11-519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and second, and likely more important, methylated DNA may be bound by proteins known as [[methyl-CpG-binding domain]] proteins (MBDs). [[Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2|MBD]] proteins then recruit additional proteins to the locus, such as [[histone deacetylase]]s and other [[chromatin remodeling]] proteins that can modify [[histone]]s, thereby forming compact, inactive chromatin, termed [[heterochromatin]]. This link between DNA methylation and chromatin structure is very important. In particular, loss of [[Methyl CpG binding protein 2|methyl-CpG-binding protein 2]] (MeCP2) has been implicated in [[Rett syndrome]]; and [[Methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2|methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2)]] mediates the transcriptional silencing of hypermethylated genes in "cancer".

=== Repression of transposable elements ===

DNA methylation is a powerful transcriptional repressor, at least in CpG dense contexts. Transcriptional repression of protein-coding genes appears essentially limited to very specific classes of genes that need to be silent permanently and in almost all tissues. While DNA methylation does not have the flexibility required for the fine-tuning of gene regulation, its stability is perfect to ensure the permanent silencing of [[transposable element]]s. Transposon control is one the most ancient functions of DNA methylation that is shared by animals, plants and multiple protists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huff JT, Zilberman D | title = Dnmt1-independent CG methylation contributes to nucleosome positioning in diverse eukaryotes | journal = Cell | volume = 156 | issue = 6 | pages = 1286–1297 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24630728 | pmc = 3969382 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is even suggested that DNA methylation evolved precisely for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yoder JA, Walsh CP, Bestor TH | title = Cytosine methylation and the ecology of intragenomic parasites | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 13 | issue = 8 | pages = 335–40 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9260521 | doi = 10.1016/s0168-9525(97)01181-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methylation of the gene body of highly transcribed genes ===

A function that appears even more conserved than transposon silencing is positively correlated with gene expression. In almost all species where DNA methylation is present, DNA methylation is especially enriched in the body of highly transcribed genes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The function of gene body methylation is not well understood. A body of evidence suggests that it could regulate [[RNA splicing|splicing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lev Maor G, Yearim A, Ast G | title = The alternative role of DNA methylation in splicing regulation | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | pages = 274–80 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25837375 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2015.03.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and suppress the activity of intragenic transcriptional units (cryptic promoters or transposable elements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maunakea AK, Nagarajan RP, Bilenky M, Ballinger TJ, D'Souza C, Fouse SD, Johnson BE, Hong C, Nielsen C, Zhao Y, Turecki G, Delaney A, Varhol R, Thiessen N, Shchors K, Heine VM, Rowitch DH, Xing X, Fiore C, Schillebeeckx M, Jones SJ, Haussler D, Marra MA, Hirst M, Wang T, Costello JF | title = Conserved role of intragenic DNA methylation in regulating alternative promoters | journal = Nature | volume = 466 | issue = 7303 | pages = 253–7 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20613842 | pmc = 3998662 | doi = 10.1038/nature09165 | bibcode = 2010Natur.466..253M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene-body methylation appears closely tied to H3K36 methylation. In yeast and mammals, H3K36 methylation is highly enriched in the body of highly transcribed genes. In yeast at least, [[H3K36me3]] recruits enzymes such as histone deacetylases to condense chromatin and prevent the activation of cryptic start sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carrozza MJ, Li B, Florens L, Suganuma T, Swanson SK, Lee KK, Shia WJ, Anderson S, Yates J, Washburn MP, Workman JL | title = Histone H3 methylation by Set2 directs deacetylation of coding regions by Rpd3S to suppress spurious intragenic transcription | journal = Cell | volume = 123 | issue = 4 | pages = 581–92 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16286007 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2005.10.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mammals, DNMT3a and DNMT3b PWWP domain binds to H3K36me3 and the two enzymes are recruited to the body of actively transcribed genes.

[[File:DNA methylation reprogramming.png|thumb|455x455px|Dynamic of DNA methylation during mouse embryonic development. E3.5-E6, etc., refer to days after fertilization. PGC: primordial germ cells]]

=== During embryonic development ===

{{main|DNA methylation reprogramming}}
DNA methylation patterns are largely erased and then re-established between generations in mammals. Almost all of the methylations from the parents are erased, first during [[gametogenesis]], and again in early [[embryogenesis]], with demethylation and remethylation occurring each time. Demethylation in early embryogenesis occurs in the preimplantation period in two stages – initially in the [[zygote]], then during the first few embryonic replication cycles of [[morula]] and [[blastula]]. A wave of methylation then takes place during the implantation stage of the embryo, with CpG islands protected from methylation. This results in global repression and allows housekeeping genes to be expressed in all cells. In the post-implantation stage, methylation patterns are stage- and tissue-specific, with changes that would define each individual cell type lasting stably over a long period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cedar H, Bergman Y | title = Programming of DNA methylation patterns | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 81 | pages = 97–117 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22404632 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-052610-091920 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/894035 }}{{subscription required|via=Annual Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas DNA methylation is not necessary ''per se'' for transcriptional silencing, it is thought nonetheless to represent a “locked” state that definitely inactivates transcription. In particular, DNA methylation appears critical for the maintenance of mono-allelic silencing in the context of [[genomic imprinting]] and [[X-inactivation|X chromosome inactivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beard C, Li E, Jaenisch R | title = Loss of methylation activates Xist in somatic but not in embryonic cells | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 9 | issue = 19 | pages = 2325–34 | date = October 1995 | pmid = 7557385 | doi = 10.1101/gad.9.19.2325 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li E, Beard C, Jaenisch R | title = Role for DNA methylation in genomic imprinting | journal = Nature | volume = 366 | issue = 6453 | pages = 362–5 | date = November 1993 | pmid = 8247133 | doi = 10.1038/366362a0 | bibcode = 1993Natur.366..362L }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, expressed and silent alleles differ by their methylation status, and loss of DNA methylation results in loss of imprinting and re-expression of Xist in somatic cells. During embryonic development, few genes change their methylation status, at the important exception of many genes specifically expressed in the germline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borgel J, Guibert S, Li Y, Chiba H, Schübeler D, Sasaki H, Forné T, Weber M | title = Targets and dynamics of promoter DNA methylation during early mouse development | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 42 | issue = 12 | pages = 1093–100 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21057502 | doi = 10.1038/ng.708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA methylation appears absolutely required in [[differentiated cell]]s, as knockout of any of the three competent DNA methyltransferase results in embryonic or post-partum lethality. By contrast, DNA methylation is dispensable in undifferentiated cell types, such as the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, primordial germ cells or embryonic stem cells. Since DNA methylation appears to directly regulate only a limited number of genes, how precisely DNA methylation absence causes the death of differentiated cells remain an open question.

Due to the phenomenon of [[genomic imprinting]], maternal and paternal genomes are differentially marked and must be properly [[DNA methylation reprogramming|reprogrammed]] every time they pass through the germline. Therefore, during [[gametogenesis]], primordial germ cells must have their original biparental DNA methylation patterns erased and re-established based on the sex of the transmitting parent. After fertilization, the paternal and maternal genomes are once again demethylated and remethylated (except for differentially methylated regions associated with imprinted genes). This reprogramming is likely required for totipotency of the newly formed embryo and erasure of acquired epigenetic changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seisenberger S, Peat JR, Hore TA, Santos F, Dean W, Reik W | title = Reprogramming DNA methylation in the mammalian life cycle: building and breaking epigenetic barriers | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

===In cancer===

{{main|DNA methylation in cancer|Regulation of transcription in cancer}}

In many disease processes, such as [[cancer]], gene promoter [[CpG island]]s acquire abnormal hypermethylation, which results in [[transcriptional silencing]] that can be inherited by daughter cells following cell division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang YP, Lei QY | title = Metabolic recoding of epigenetics in cancer | journal = Cancer Communications | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 25 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29784032 | pmc = 5993135 | doi = 10.1186/s40880-018-0302-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alterations of DNA methylation have been recognized as an important component of cancer development. Hypomethylation, in general, arises earlier and is linked to chromosomal instability and loss of imprinting, whereas hypermethylation is associated with promoters and can arise secondary to gene (oncogene suppressor) silencing, but might be a target for [[epigenetic therapy]].&lt;ref name="pmid19707296"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Daura-Oller E, Cabre M, Montero MA, Paternain JL, Romeu A | title = Specific gene hypomethylation and cancer: new insights into coding region feature trends | journal = Bioinformation | volume = 3 | issue = 8 | pages = 340–3 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19707296 | pmc = 2720671 | doi = 10.6026/97320630003340 }}&lt;!--only basic claims here, nothing controversial or specific to paper--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Global hypomethylation has also been implicated in the development and progression of cancer through different mechanisms.&lt;ref name="CraigJMWongNC"&gt;{{cite book |author= Craig, JM; Wong, NC (editor) |year=2011 |title=Epigenetics: A Reference Manual |publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] |isbn= 978-1-904455-88-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, there is hypermethylation of [[tumor suppressor gene]]s and hypomethylation of [[oncogene]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid20448029"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gonzalo S | title = Epigenetic alterations in aging | journal = Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 109 | issue = 2 | pages = 586–97 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20448029 | pmc = 2928596 | doi = 10.1152/japplphysiol.00238.2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, in progression to cancer, hundreds of genes are [[Regulation of transcription in cancer#Transcription silencing/activation in cancers|silenced or activated]]. Although silencing of some genes in cancers occurs by mutation, a large proportion of carcinogenic gene silencing is a result of altered DNA methylation (see [[DNA methylation in cancer]]). DNA methylation causing silencing in cancer typically occurs at multiple [[CpG site]]s in the [[CpG site#CpG island|CpG island]]s that are present in the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] of protein coding genes.

Altered expressions of [[microRNA]]s also silence or activate many genes in progression to cancer (see [[MicroRNA#cancer|microRNAs in cancer]]). Altered microRNA expression occurs through [[Regulation of transcription in cancer#Transcription silencing/activation in cancers|hyper/hypo-methylation]] of [[CpG site]]s in [[CpG site#CpG island|CpG island]]s in promoters controlling transcription of the [[microRNA]]s.

Silencing of DNA repair genes through methylation of CpG islands in their promoters appears to be especially important in progression to cancer (see [[DNA methylation in cancer#Likely role of hypermethylation of DNA repair genes in cancer|methylation of DNA repair genes in cancer]]).

===In atherosclerosis===

Epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation have been implicated in cardiovascular disease, including [[atherosclerosis]]. In animal models of atherosclerosis, vascular tissue, as well as blood cells such as mononuclear blood cells, exhibit global hypomethylation with gene-specific areas of hypermethylation. DNA methylation polymorphisms may be used as an early biomarker of atherosclerosis since they are present before lesions are observed, which may provide an early tool for detection and risk prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lund G, Andersson L, Lauria M, Lindholm M, Fraga MF, Villar-Garea A, Ballestar E, Esteller M, Zaina S | title = DNA methylation polymorphisms precede any histological sign of atherosclerosis in mice lacking apolipoprotein E | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 279 | issue = 28 | pages = 29147–54 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15131116 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.m403618200 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the cell types targeted for DNA methylation polymorphisms are monocytes and lymphocytes, which experience an overall hypomethylation. One proposed mechanism behind this global hypomethylation is elevated [[homocysteine]] levels causing [[hyperhomocysteinemia]], a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. High plasma levels of homocysteine inhibit DNA methyltransferases, which causes hypomethylation. Hypomethylation of DNA affects genes that alter smooth muscle cell proliferation, cause endothelial cell dysfunction, and increase inflammatory mediators, all of which are critical in forming atherosclerotic lesions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castro R, Rivera I, Struys EA, Jansen EE, Ravasco P, Camilo ME, Blom HJ, Jakobs C, Tavares de Almeida I | title = Increased homocysteine and S-adenosylhomocysteine concentrations and DNA hypomethylation in vascular disease | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 49 | issue = 8 | pages = 1292–6 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12881445 | doi = 10.1373/49.8.1292 | first10 = T. | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; High levels of homocysteine also result in hypermethylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of the [[estrogen receptor]] alpha (ERα) gene, causing its down regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huang YS, Zhi YF, Wang SR | title = Hypermethylation of estrogen receptor-alpha gene in atheromatosis patients and its correlation with homocysteine | journal = Pathophysiology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 259–65 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19285843 | doi = 10.1016/j.pathophys.2009.02.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ERα protects against atherosclerosis due to its action as a growth suppressor, causing the smooth muscle cells to remain in a quiescent state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dong C, Yoon W, Goldschmidt-Clermont PJ | title = DNA methylation and atherosclerosis | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 132 | issue = 8 Suppl | pages = 2406S–2409S | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12163701 | doi = 10.1093/jn/132.8.2406S | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypermethylation of the ERα promoter thus allows intimal smooth muscle cells to proliferate excessively and contribute to the development of the atherosclerotic lesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ying AK, Hassanain HH, Roos CM, Smiraglia DJ, Issa JJ, Michler RE, Caligiuri M, Plass C, Goldschmidt-Clermont PJ | title = Methylation of the estrogen receptor-alpha gene promoter is selectively increased in proliferating human aortic smooth muscle cells | journal = Cardiovascular Research | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 172–9 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10727665 | doi = 10.1016/s0008-6363(00)00004-3 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another gene that experiences a change in methylation status in atherosclerosis is the [[monocarboxylate transporter]] (MCT3), which produces a protein responsible for the transport of lactate and other ketone bodies out of many cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells. In atherosclerosis patients, there is an increase in methylation of the CpG islands in exon 2, which decreases MCT3 protein expression. The downregulation of MCT3 impairs lactate transport and significantly increases smooth muscle cell proliferation, which further contributes to the atherosclerotic lesion. An ex vivo experiment using the demethylating agent [[Decitabine]] (5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine) was shown to induce MCT3 expression in a dose dependent manner, as all hypermethylated sites in the exon 2 CpG island became demethylated after treatment. This may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to treat atherosclerosis, although no human studies have been conducted thus far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhu S, Goldschmidt-Clermont PJ, Dong C | title = Inactivation of monocarboxylate transporter MCT3 by DNA methylation in atherosclerosis | journal = Circulation | volume = 112 | issue = 9 | pages = 1353–61 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16116050 | doi = 10.1161/circulationaha.104.519025 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In aging===
In humans and other mammals, DNA methylation levels can be used to accurately estimate the age of tissues and cell types, forming an accurate [[epigenetic clock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horvath S | title = DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 10 | pages = R115 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24138928 | pmc = 4015143 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[longitudinal study]] of [[twin]] children showed that, between the ages of 5 and 10, there was divergence of methylation patterns due to environmental rather than genetic influences.&lt;ref name="pmid20505345"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong CC, Caspi A, Williams B, Craig IW, Houts R, Ambler A, Moffitt TE, Mill J | title = A longitudinal study of epigenetic variation in twins | journal = Epigenetics | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 516–26 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20505345 | pmc = 3322496 | doi = 10.4161/epi.5.6.12226 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a global loss of DNA methylation during aging.&lt;ref name="pmid20448029" /&gt;

In a study that analyzed the complete DNA methylomes of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[T cell]]s in a newborn, a 26 years old individual and a 103 years old individual were observed that the loss of methylation is proportional to age{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.

=== In B-cell differentiation ===

A study that investigated the methylome of [[B cell]]s along their differentiation cycle, using whole-genome [[bisulfite sequencing]] (WGBS), showed that there is a hypomethylation from the earliest stages to the most differentiated stages. The largest methylation difference is between the stages of germinal center B cells and memory B cells.

==DNA methyltransferases (in mammals)==

[[File:DNA methylation (corrected).png|thumb|right|Possible pathways of cytosine methylation and demethylation. Abbreviations: [[S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine]] ('''SAH'''), [[S-adenosyl-L-methionine]] ('''SAM'''), [[DNA methyltransferase]] ('''DNA MTase'''), [[Uracil-DNA glycosylase]] ('''UNG''')]]

In mammalian cells, DNA methylation occurs mainly at the C5 position of CpG dinucleotides and is carried out by two general classes of enzymatic activities – maintenance methylation and ''de novo'' methylation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.methods.info/Methods/DNA_methylation/Methylation_review.html|title=Review on DNA Methylation|first=Alexei Gratchev|last=PhD|website=www.methods.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintenance methylation activity is necessary to preserve DNA methylation after every cellular DNA replication cycle. Without the [[DNA methyltransferase]] (DNMT), the replication machinery itself would produce daughter strands that are unmethylated and, over time, would lead to passive demethylation. DNMT1 is the proposed maintenance methyltransferase that is responsible for copying DNA methylation patterns to the daughter strands during DNA replication. Mouse models with both copies of DNMT1 deleted are embryonic lethal at approximately day 9, due to the requirement of DNMT1 activity for development in mammalian cells.

It is thought that DNMT3a and DNMT3b are the ''de novo'' methyltransferases that set up DNA methylation patterns early in development. DNMT3L is a protein that is homologous to the other DNMT3s but has no catalytic activity. Instead, DNMT3L assists the ''de novo'' methyltransferases by increasing their ability to bind to DNA and stimulating their activity. Mice and rats have a third functional ''de novo'' methyltransferase enzyme named DNMT3C, which evolved as a paralog of ''Dnmt3b'' by tandem duplication in the common ancestral of Muroidea rodents. DNMT3C catalyzes the methylation of promoters of transposable elements during early spermatogenesis, an activity shown to be essential for their epigenetic repression and male fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barau J, Teissandier A, Zamudio N, Roy S, Nalesso V, Hérault Y, Guillou F, Bourc'his D | title = The DNA methyltransferase DNMT3C protects male germ cells from transposon activity | journal = Science | volume = 354 | issue = 6314 | pages = 909–912 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27856912 | doi = 10.1126/science.aah5143 | bibcode = 2016Sci...354..909B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jain D, Meydan C, Lange J, Claeys Bouuaert C, Lailler N, Mason CE, Anderson KV, Keeney S | title = rahu is a mutant allele of Dnmt3c, encoding a DNA methyltransferase homolog required for meiosis and transposon repression in the mouse male germline | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 13 | issue = 8 | pages = e1006964 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28854222 | pmc = 5607212 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is yet unclear if in other mammals that do not have DNMT3C (like humans) rely on DNMT3B or DNMT3A for ''de novo'' methylation of transposable elements in the germline. Finally, [[TRDMT1|DNMT2 (TRDMT1)]] has been identified as a DNA methyltransferase homolog, containing all 10 sequence motifs common to all DNA methyltransferases; however, DNMT2 (TRDMT1) does not methylate DNA but instead methylates cytosine-38 in the anticodon loop of aspartic acid transfer RNA.&lt;ref name="pmid16424344"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goll MG, Kirpekar F, Maggert KA, Yoder JA, Hsieh CL, Zhang X, Golic KG, Jacobsen SE, Bestor TH | title = Methylation of tRNAAsp by the DNA methyltransferase homolog Dnmt2 | journal = Science | volume = 311 | issue = 5759 | pages = 395–8 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16424344 | doi = 10.1126/science.1120976 | bibcode = 2006Sci...311..395G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since many tumor suppressor genes are silenced by DNA methylation during [[carcinogenesis]], there have been attempts to re-express these genes by inhibiting the DNMTs. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine ([[decitabine]]) is a [[base analog|nucleoside analog]] that inhibits DNMTs by trapping them in a covalent complex on DNA by preventing the β-elimination step of catalysis, thus resulting in the enzymes' degradation. However, for decitabine to be active, it must be incorporated into the [[genome]] of the cell, which can cause mutations in the daughter cells if the cell does not die. In addition, decitabine is toxic to the bone marrow, which limits the size of its therapeutic window. These pitfalls have led to the development of antisense RNA therapies that target the DNMTs by degrading their [[mRNA]]s and preventing their [[Translation (biology)|translation]]. However, it is currently unclear whether targeting DNMT1 alone is sufficient to reactivate tumor suppressor genes silenced by DNA methylation.

==In plants==
Significant progress has been made in understanding DNA methylation in the model plant ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. DNA methylation in plants differs from that of mammals: while DNA methylation in mammals mainly occurs on the cytosine nucleotide in a [[CpG site]], in plants the cytosine can be methylated at CpG, CpHpG, and CpHpH sites, where H represents any nucleotide but not guanine. Overall, ''Arabidopsis'' DNA is highly methylated, [[mass spectrometry]] analysis estimated 14% of cytosines to be modified.&lt;ref name=pmid24640988/&gt;{{Rp|abstract}}

The principal ''Arabidopsis'' DNA methyltransferase enzymes, which transfer and covalently attach methyl groups onto DNA, are DRM2, MET1, and CMT3. Both the DRM2 and MET1 proteins share significant homology to the mammalian methyltransferases DNMT3 and DNMT1, respectively, whereas the CMT3 protein is unique to the plant kingdom. There are currently two classes of DNA methyltransferases: 1) the ''de novo'' class or enzymes that create new methylation marks on the DNA; 2) a maintenance class that recognizes the methylation marks on the parental strand of DNA and transfers new methylation to the daughter strands after DNA replication. DRM2 is the only enzyme that has been implicated as a ''de novo'' DNA methyltransferase. DRM2 has also been shown, along with MET1 and CMT3 to be involved in maintaining methylation marks through DNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cao X, Jacobsen SE | title = Locus-specific control of asymmetric and CpNpG methylation by the DRM and CMT3 methyltransferase genes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 Suppl 4 | issue = Suppl 4 | pages = 16491–8 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12151602 | pmc = 139913 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.162371599 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...9916491C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other DNA methyltransferases are expressed in plants but have no known function (see the [https://web.archive.org/web/20190410083124/http://www.chromdb.org/ Chromatin Database]).

It is not clear how the cell determines the locations of ''de novo'' DNA methylation, but evidence suggests that for many (though not all) locations, [[RNA-directed DNA methylation]] (RdDM) is involved. In RdDM, specific RNA transcripts are produced from a genomic DNA template, and this RNA forms secondary structures called double-stranded RNA molecules.&lt;ref name="aufsatz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aufsatz W, Mette MF, van der Winden J, Matzke AJ, Matzke M | title = RNA-directed DNA methylation in Arabidopsis | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 99 Suppl 4 | issue = 90004 | pages = 16499–506 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12169664 | pmc = 139914 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.162371499 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...9916499A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The double-stranded RNAs, through either the small interfering RNA ([[siRNA]]) or microRNA ([[miRNA]]) pathways direct de-novo DNA methylation of the original genomic location that produced the RNA.&lt;ref name="aufsatz"/&gt; This sort of mechanism is thought to be important in cellular defense against [[RNA viruses]] and/or [[transposons]], both of which often form a double-stranded RNA that can be mutagenic to the host genome. By methylating their genomic locations, through an as yet poorly understood mechanism, they are shut off and are no longer active in the cell, protecting the genome from their mutagenic effect. Recently, it was described that methylation of the DNA is the main determinant of embryogenic cultures formation from explants in woody plants and is regarded the main mechanism that explains the poor response of mature explants to somatic embryogenesis in the plants (Isah 2016).

==In bacteria==

[[Adenine]] or [[cytosine]] methylation is part of the [[restriction modification system]] of many [[bacterium|bacteria]], in which specific DNA sequences are methylated periodically throughout the genome. A [[methylase]] is the enzyme that recognizes a specific sequence and methylates one of the bases in or near that sequence. Foreign DNAs (which are not methylated in this manner) that are introduced into the cell are degraded by sequence-specific [[restriction enzyme]]s and cleaved. Bacterial genomic DNA is not recognized by these restriction enzymes. The methylation of native DNA acts as a sort of primitive immune system, allowing the bacteria to protect themselves from infection by [[bacteriophage]].

''[[E. coli]]'' [[Dna adenine methylase|DNA adenine methyltransferase]] (Dam) is an enzyme of ~32 kDa that does not belong to a restriction/modification system. The target recognition sequence for ''E. coli'' Dam is GATC, as the methylation occurs at the N6 position of the adenine in this sequence (G meATC). The three base pairs flanking each side of this site also influence DNA–Dam binding. Dam plays several key roles in bacterial processes, including mismatch repair, the timing of DNA replication, and gene expression. As a result of DNA replication, the status of GATC sites in the ''E. coli'' genome changes from fully methylated to hemimethylated. This is because adenine introduced into the new DNA strand is unmethylated. Re-methylation occurs within two to four seconds, during which time replication errors in the new strand are repaired. Methylation, or its absence, is the marker that allows the repair apparatus of the cell to differentiate between the template and nascent strands. It has been shown that altering Dam activity in bacteria results in an increased spontaneous mutation rate. Bacterial viability is compromised in dam mutants that also lack certain other DNA repair enzymes, providing further evidence for the role of Dam in DNA repair.

One region of the DNA that keeps its hemimethylated status for longer is the [[origin of replication]], which has an abundance of GATC sites. This is central to the bacterial mechanism for timing DNA replication. SeqA binds to the origin of replication, sequestering it and thus preventing methylation. Because hemimethylated origins of replication are inactive, this mechanism limits DNA replication to once per cell cycle.

Expression of certain genes, for example, those coding for [[pilus]] expression in ''E. coli'', is regulated by the methylation of GATC sites in the promoter region of the gene operon. The cells' environmental conditions just after DNA replication determine whether Dam is blocked from methylating a region proximal to or distal from the promoter region. Once the pattern of methylation has been created, the pilus gene transcription is locked in the on or off position until the DNA is again replicated. In ''E. coli'', these pili [[operon]]s have important roles in virulence in urinary tract infections. It has been proposed{{By whom|date=December 2010}} that inhibitors of Dam may function as antibiotics.

On the other hand, DNA cytosine methylase targets CCAGG and CCTGG sites to methylate cytosine at the C5 position (C meC(A/T) GG). The other methylase enzyme, EcoKI, causes methylation of adenines in the sequences AAC(N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)GTGC and GCAC(N&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)GTT.

In ''Clostridioides difficile'', DNA methylation at the target motif CAAAAA was shown to impact [[sporulation]], a key step in disease transmission, as well as cell length, biofilm formation and host colonization.&lt;ref name=":110"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oliveira|first=Pedro H.|last2=Ribis|first2=John W.|last3=Garrett|first3=Elizabeth M.|last4=Trzilova|first4=Dominika|last5=Kim|first5=Alex|last6=Sekulovic|first6=Ognjen|last7=Mead|first7=Edward A.|last8=Pak|first8=Theodore|last9=Zhu|first9=Shijia|last10=Deikus|first10=Gintaras|last11=Touchon|first11=Marie|title=Epigenomic characterization of Clostridioides difficile finds a conserved DNA methyltransferase that mediates sporulation and pathogenesis|journal=Nature Microbiology|volume=5|issue=1|language=en|pages=166–180|doi=10.1038/s41564-019-0613-4|pmid=31768029|pmc=6925328|issn=2058-5276|year=2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Molecular cloning===

Most strains used by molecular biologists are derivatives of ''E. coli'' K-12, and possess both Dam and Dcm, but there are commercially available strains that are dam-/dcm- (lack of activity of either methylase). In fact, it is possible to unmethylate the DNA extracted from dam+/dcm+ strains by transforming it into dam-/dcm- strains. This would help digest sequences that are not being recognized by methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palmer BR, Marinus MG | title = The dam and dcm strains of Escherichia coli--a review | journal = Gene | volume = 143 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–12 | date = May 1994 | pmid = 8200522 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(94)90597-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making unmethylated (dam-/dcm-) DNA |url=http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/tech_reference/restriction_enzymes/making_unmethylated_dna.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106183728/http://www.neb.com/nebecomm/tech_reference/restriction_enzymes/making_unmethylated_dna.asp |archive-date=2011-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[restriction enzyme]] DpnI can recognize 5'-GmeATC-3' sites and digest the methylated DNA. Being such a short motif, it occurs frequently in sequences by chance, and as such its primary use for researchers is to degrade template DNA following [[PCR]]s (PCR products lack methylation, as no methylases are present in the reaction). Similarly, some commercially available restriction enzymes are sensitive to methylation at their cognate restriction sites and must as mentioned previously be used on DNA passed through a dam-/dcm- strain to allow cutting.

==Detection==

DNA methylation can be detected by the following assays currently used in scientific research:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rana AK| title = Crime investigation through DNA methylation analysis: methods and applications in forensics. | journal = Egyptian Journal of Forensic Sciences | date = January 2018 | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | doi = 10.1186/s41935-018-0042-1 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Bisulfite sequencing#Applications: genome-wide methylation analysis|Whole genome bisulfite sequencing]], also known as BS-Seq, which is a high-throughput genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation. It is based on the aforementioned sodium bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA, which is then sequenced on a [[Next-generation sequencing#High-throughput sequencing|Next-generation sequencing platform]]. The sequences obtained are then re-aligned to the reference genome to determine the methylation status of CpG dinucleotides based on mismatches resulting from the conversion of unmethylated cytosines into uracil.
* [[Bisulfite sequencing#Applications: genome-wide methylation analysis|Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing]], also known as RRBS knows several working protocols. The first RRBS protocol was called RRBS and aims for around 10% of the methylome, a reference genome is needed. Later came more protocols that were able to sequence a smaller portion of the genome and higher sample multiplexing. EpiGBS was the first protocol where you could multiplex 96 samples in one lane of Illumina sequencing and were a reference genome was no longer needed. A de novo reference construction from the Watson and Crick reads made population screening of SNP's and SMP's simultaneously a fact.
* The [[HELP assay]], which is based on restriction enzymes' differential ability to recognize and cleave methylated and unmethylated CpG DNA sites.
* [[GLAD-PCR-assay|GLAD-PCR assay]], which is based on a new type of enzymes – site-specific methyl-directed DNA endonucleases, which hydrolyze only methylated DNA.
* [[ChIP-on-chip]] assays, which is based on the ability of commercially prepared antibodies to bind to DNA methylation-associated proteins like MeCP2.
* [[Restriction landmark genomic scanning]], a complicated and now rarely used assay based upon restriction enzymes' differential recognition of methylated and unmethylated CpG sites; the assay is similar in concept to the HELP assay.
* [[Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation]] (MeDIP), analogous to [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]], [[immunoprecipitation]] is used to isolate methylated DNA fragments for input into DNA detection methods such as [[DNA microarrays]] (MeDIP-chip) or [[DNA sequencing]] (MeDIP-seq).
* [[Pyrosequencing]] of bisulfite treated DNA. This is the sequencing of an amplicon made by a normal forward primer but a biotinylated reverse primer to PCR the gene of choice. The Pyrosequencer then analyses the sample by denaturing the DNA and adding one nucleotide at a time to the mix according to a sequence given by the user. If there is a mismatch, it is recorded and the percentage of DNA for which the mismatch is present is noted. This gives the user a percentage of methylation per CpG island.
* Molecular break light assay for DNA adenine methyltransferase activity – an assay that relies on the specificity of the restriction enzyme DpnI for fully methylated (adenine methylation) GATC sites in an oligonucleotide labeled with a fluorophore and quencher. The adenine methyltransferase methylates the oligonucleotide making it a substrate for DpnI. Cutting of the oligonucleotide by DpnI gives rise to a fluorescence increase.&lt;ref name="pmid17726531"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wood RJ, Maynard-Smith MD, Robinson VL, Oyston PC, Titball RW, Roach PL | title = Kinetic analysis of Yersinia pestis DNA adenine methyltransferase activity using a hemimethylated molecular break light oligonucleotide | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | pages = e801 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17726531 | pmc = 1949145 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000801 | editor1-last = Fugmann | editor1-first = Sebastian | bibcode = 2007PLoSO...2..801W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17263334"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li J, Yan H, Wang K, Tan W, Zhou X | title = Hairpin fluorescence DNA probe for real-time monitoring of DNA methylation | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 79 | issue = 3 | pages = 1050–6 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17263334 | doi = 10.1021/ac061694i }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Methyl Sensitive Southern Blotting is similar to the HELP assay, although uses Southern blotting techniques to probe gene-specific differences in methylation using restriction digests. This technique is used to evaluate local methylation near the binding site for the probe.
* MethylCpG Binding Proteins (MBPs) and fusion proteins containing just the Methyl Binding Domain (MBD) are used to separate native DNA into methylated and unmethylated fractions. The percentage methylation of individual CpG islands can be determined by quantifying the amount of the target in each fraction.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}} Extremely sensitive detection can be achieved in FFPE tissues with abscription-based detection.
* [[High Resolution Melt]] Analysis (HRM or HRMA), is a post-[[PCR]] analytical technique. The target DNA is treated with sodium bisulfite, which chemically converts unmethylated cytosines into uracils, while methylated cytosines are preserved. PCR amplification is then carried out with primers designed to amplify both methylated and unmethylated templates. After this amplification, highly methylated DNA sequences contain a higher number of CpG sites compared to unmethylated templates, which results in a different melting temperature that can be used in quantitative methylation detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wojdacz TK, Dobrovic A | title = Methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM): a new approach for sensitive and high-throughput assessment of methylation | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = e41 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17289753 | pmc = 1874596 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkm013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Malentacchi F, Forni G, Vinci S, Orlando C | title = Quantitative evaluation of DNA methylation by optimization of a differential-high resolution melt analysis protocol | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 37 | issue = 12 | pages = e86 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19454604 | pmc = 2709587 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkp383 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ancient DNA methylation reconstruction, a method to reconstruct high-resolution DNA methylation from ancient DNA samples. The method is based on the natural degradation processes that occur in ancient DNA: with time, methylated cytosines are degraded into thymines, whereas unmethylated cytosines are degraded into uracils. This asymmetry in degradation signals was used to reconstruct the full methylation maps of the [[Neanderthal]] and the [[Denisovan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gokhman D, Lavi E, Prüfer K, Fraga MF, Riancho JA, Kelso J, Pääbo S, Meshorer E, Carmel L | title = Reconstructing the DNA methylation maps of the Neandertal and the Denisovan | journal = Science | volume = 344 | issue = 6183 | pages = 523–7 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24786081 | doi = 10.1126/science.1250368 | bibcode = 2014Sci...344..523G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2019, researchers published a novel method to infer morphological traits from DNA methylation data. The authors were able to show that linking down-regulated genes to phenotypes of monogenic diseases, where one or two copies of a gene are perturbed, allows for ~85% accuracy in reconstructing anatomical traits directly from DNA methylation maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gokhman|first=David|last2=Mishol|first2=Nadav|last3=de Manuel|first3=Marc|last4=de Juan|first4=David|last5=Shuqrun|first5=Jonathan|last6=Meshorer|first6=Eran|last7=Marques-Bonet|first7=Tomas|last8=Rak|first8=Yoel|last9=Carmel|first9=Liran|date=2019-09-19|title=Reconstructing Denisovan Anatomy Using DNA Methylation Maps|journal=Cell|volume=179|issue=1|pages=180–192.e10|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2019.08.035|issn=1097-4172|pmid=31539495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differentially methylated regions (DMRs)==
[[Differentially methylated regions]], are genomic regions with different methylation statuses among multiple samples (tissues, cells, individuals or others), are regarded as possible functional regions involved in gene transcriptional regulation. The identification of DMRs among multiple tissues (T-DMRs) provides a comprehensive survey of epigenetic differences among human tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rakyan VK, Down TA, Thorne NP, Flicek P, Kulesha E, Gräf S, Tomazou EM, Bäckdahl L, Johnson N, Herberth M, Howe KL, Jackson DK, Miretti MM, Fiegler H, Marioni JC, Birney E, Hubbard TJ, Carter NP, Tavaré S, Beck S | title = An integrated resource for genome-wide identification and analysis of human tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tDMRs) | journal = Genome Research | volume = 18 | issue = 9 | pages = 1518–29 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18577705 | pmc = 2527707 | doi = 10.1101/gr.077479.108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, these methylated regions that are unique to a particular tissue allow individuals to differentiate between tissue type, such as semen and vaginal fluid. Current research conducted by Lee et al., showed DACT1 and USP49 positively identified semen by examining T-DMRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee HY, Park MJ, Choi A, An JH, Yang WI, Shin KJ | title = Potential forensic application of DNA methylation profiling to body fluid identification | journal = International Journal of Legal Medicine | volume = 126 | issue = 1 | pages = 55–62 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 21626087 | doi = 10.1007/s00414-011-0569-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of T-DMRs has proven useful in the identification of various body fluids found at crime scenes. Researchers in the forensic field are currently seeking novel T-DMRs in genes to use as markers in forensic DNA analysis. DMRs between cancer and normal samples (C-DMRs) demonstrate the aberrant methylation in cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Irizarry RA, Ladd-Acosta C, Wen B, Wu Z, Montano C, Onyango P, Cui H, Gabo K, Rongione M, Webster M, Ji H, Potash J, Sabunciyan S, Feinberg AP | title = The human colon cancer methylome shows similar hypo- and hypermethylation at conserved tissue-specific CpG island shores | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 41 | issue = 2 | pages = 178–186 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19151715 | pmc = 2729128 | doi = 10.1038/ng.298 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is well known that DNA methylation is associated with cell differentiation and proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reik W, Dean W, Walter J | title = Epigenetic reprogramming in mammalian development | journal = Science | volume = 293 | issue = 5532 | pages = 1089–93 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11498579 | doi = 10.1126/science.1063443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many DMRs have been found in the development stages (D-DMRs) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meissner A, Mikkelsen TS, Gu H, Wernig M, Hanna J, Sivachenko A, Zhang X, Bernstein BE, Nusbaum C, Jaffe DB, Gnirke A, Jaenisch R, Lander ES | title = Genome-scale DNA methylation maps of pluripotent and differentiated cells | journal = Nature | volume = 454 | issue = 7205 | pages = 766–70 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18600261 | pmc = 2896277 | doi = 10.1038/nature07107 | bibcode = 2008Natur.454..766M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the reprogrammed progress (R-DMRs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doi A, Park IH, Wen B, Murakami P, Aryee MJ, Irizarry R, Herb B, Ladd-Acosta C, Rho J, Loewer S, Miller J, Schlaeger T, Daley GQ, Feinberg AP | title = Differential methylation of tissue- and cancer-specific CpG island shores distinguishes human induced pluripotent stem cells, embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 41 | issue = 12 | pages = 1350–3 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19881528 | pmc = 2958040 | doi = 10.1038/ng.471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are intra-individual DMRs (Intra-DMRs) with longitudinal changes in global DNA methylation along with the increase of age in a given individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bjornsson HT, Sigurdsson MI, Fallin MD, Irizarry RA, Aspelund T, Cui H, Yu W, Rongione MA, Ekström TJ, Harris TB, Launer LJ, Eiriksdottir G, Leppert MF, Sapienza C, Gudnason V, Feinberg AP | title = Intra-individual change over time in DNA methylation with familial clustering | journal = JAMA | volume = 299 | issue = 24 | pages = 2877–83 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18577732 | pmc = 2581898 | doi = 10.1001/jama.299.24.2877 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also inter-individual DMRs (Inter-DMRs) with different methylation patterns among multiple individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bock C, Walter J, Paulsen M, Lengauer T | title = Inter-individual variation of DNA methylation and its implications for large-scale epigenome mapping | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 36 | issue = 10 | pages = e55 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18413340 | pmc = 2425484 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

QDMR (Quantitative Differentially Methylated Regions) is a quantitative approach to quantify methylation difference and identify DMRs from genome-wide methylation profiles by adapting Shannon entropy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/qdmr|title=QDMR: a quantitative method for identification of differentially methylated regions by entropy|website=bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform-free and species-free nature of QDMR makes it potentially applicable to various methylation data. This approach provides an effective tool for the high-throughput identification of the functional regions involved in epigenetic regulation. QDMR can be used as an effective tool for the quantification of methylation difference and identification of DMRs across multiple samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Y, Liu H, Lv J, Xiao X, Zhu J, Liu X, Su J, Li X, Wu Q, Wang F, Cui Y | title = QDMR: a quantitative method for identification of differentially methylated regions by entropy | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 39 | issue = 9 | pages = e58 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21306990 | pmc = 3089487 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gene-set analysis (a.k.a. pathway analysis; usually performed tools such as DAVID, GoSeq or GSEA) has been shown to be severely biased when applied to high-throughput methylation data (e.g. MeDIP-seq, MeDIP-ChIP, HELP-seq etc.), and a wide range of studies have thus mistakenly reported hyper-methylation of genes related to development and differentiation; it has been suggested that this can be corrected using sample label permutations or using a statistical model to control for differences in the numbers of CpG probes / CpG sites that target each gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geeleher P, Hartnett L, Egan LJ, Golden A, Raja Ali RA, Seoighe C | title = Gene-set analysis is severely biased when applied to genome-wide methylation data | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 29 | issue = 15 | pages = 1851–7 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23732277 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btt311 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA methylation marks==
[[DNA methylation marks]] – genomic regions with specific methylation patterns in a specific biological state such as tissue, cell type, individual – are regarded as possible functional regions involved in gene transcriptional regulation. Although various human cell types may have the same genome, these cells have different methylomes. The systematic identification and characterization of methylation marks across cell types are crucial to understanding the complex regulatory network for cell fate determination. Hongbo Liu et al. proposed an entropy-based framework termed SMART to integrate the whole genome bisulfite sequencing methylomes across 42 human tissues/cells and identified 757,887 genome segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu H, Liu X, Zhang S, Lv J, Li S, Shang S, Jia S, Wei Y, Wang F, Su J, Wu Q, Zhang Y | title = Systematic identification and annotation of human methylation marks based on bisulfite sequencing methylomes reveals distinct roles of cell type-specific hypomethylation in the regulation of cell identity genes | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–94 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26635396 | pmc = 4705665 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkv1332 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 75% of the segments showed uniform methylation across all cell types. From the remaining 25% of the segments, they identified cell type-specific hypo/hypermethylation marks that were specifically hypo/hypermethylated in a minority of cell types using a statistical approach and presented an atlas of the human methylation marks. Further analysis revealed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks were enriched through [[H3K27ac]] and transcription factor binding sites in a cell type-specific manner. In particular, they observed that the cell type-specific hypomethylation marks are associated with the cell type-specific super-enhancers that drive the expression of cell identity genes. This framework provides a complementary, functional annotation of the human genome and helps to elucidate the critical features and functions of cell type-specific hypomethylation.

The entropy-based Specific Methylation Analysis and Report Tool, termed "SMART", which focuses on integrating a large number of DNA methylomes for the de novo identification of cell type-specific methylation marks. The latest version of SMART is focused on three main functions including de novo identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) by genome segmentation, identification of DMRs from predefined regions of interest, and identification of differentially methylated CpG sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fame.edbc.org/smart/|title= SMART 2: A Comprehensive Analysis Tool for Bisulfite Sequencing Data |website= fame.edbc.org |last = Liu|first = Hongbo |date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In identification and detection of body fluids ===
DNA methylation allows for several tissues to be analyzed in one assay as well as for small amounts of body fluid to be identified with the use of extracted DNA. Usually, the two approaches of DNA methylation are either methylated-sensitive restriction enzymes or treatment with sodium bisulphite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sijen|first=Titia|date=September 2015|title=Molecular approaches for forensic cell type identification: On mRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation and microbial markers|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics|volume=18|pages=21–32|doi=10.1016/j.fsigen.2014.11.015|pmid=25488609|issn=1872-4973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methylated sensitive restriction enzymes work by cleaving specific CpG, cytosine and guanine separated by only one phosphate group, recognition sites when the CpG is methylated. In contrast, unmethylated cytosines are transformed to uracil and in the process, methylated cytosines remain methylated. In particular, methylation profiles can provide insight on when or how body fluids were left at crime scenes, identify the kind of body fluid, and approximate age, gender, and phenotypic characteristics of perpetrators.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kader F, Ghai M | title = DNA methylation and application in forensic sciences | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 249 | pages = 255–65 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25732744 | doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2015.01.037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates various markers that can be used for DNA methylation. Deciding which marker to use for an assay is one of the first steps of the identification of body fluids. In general, markers are selected by examining prior research conducted. Identification markers that are chosen should give a positive result for one type of cell. One portion of the chromosome that is an area of focus when conducting DNA methylation are tissue-specific differentially methylated regions, T-DMRs.The degree of methylation for the T-DMRs ranges depending on the body fluid.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A research team developed a marker system that is two-fold. The first marker is methylated only in the target fluid while the second is methylated in the rest of the fluids.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For instance, if venous blood marker A is un-methylated and venous blood marker B is methylated in a fluid, it indicates the presence of only venous blood. In contrast, if venous blood marker A is methylated and venous blood marker B is un-methylated in some fluid, then that indicates venous blood is in a mixture of fluids. Some examples for DNA methylation markers are Mens1(menstrual blood), Spei1(saliva), and Sperm2(seminal fluid).

DNA methylation provides a relatively good means of sensitivity when identifying and detecting body fluids. In one study, only ten nanograms of a sample was necessary to ascertain successful results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silva DS, Antunes J, Balamurugan K, Duncan G, Alho CS, McCord B | title = Developmental validation studies of epigenetic DNA methylation markers for the detection of blood, semen and saliva samples | journal = Forensic Science International. Genetics | volume = 23 | pages = 55–63 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27010659 | doi = 10.1016/j.fsigen.2016.01.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA methylation provides a good discernment of mixed samples since it involves markers that give “on or off” signals. DNA methylation is not impervious to external conditions. Even under degraded conditions using the DNA methylation techniques, the markers are stable enough that there are still noticeable differences between degraded samples and control samples. Specifically, in one study, it was found that there were not any noticeable changes in methylation patterns over an extensive period of time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Computational prediction==
DNA methylation can also be detected by computational models through sophisticated algorithms and methods. Computational models can facilitate the global profiling of DNA methylation across chromosomes, and often such models are faster and cheaper to perform than biological assays. Such up-to-date computational models include Bhasin, ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="pmid16051225"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhasin M, Zhang H, Reinherz EL, Reche PA | title = Prediction of methylated CpGs in DNA sequences using a support vector machine | journal = FEBS Letters | volume = 579 | issue = 20 | pages = 4302–8 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16051225 | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2005.07.002 | url = https://eprints.ucm.es/9330/1/28.Bhasin_etal_FEBS_2005.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bock, ''et al''.,&lt;ref name="pmid16520826"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bock C, Paulsen M, Tierling S, Mikeska T, Lengauer T, Walter J | title = CpG island methylation in human lymphocytes is highly correlated with DNA sequence, repeats, and predicted DNA structure | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = e26 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16520826 | pmc = 1386721 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zheng, ''et al''.&lt;ref name="pmid16520822"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zheng H, Jiang SW, Wu H |title=Enhancement on the predictive power of the prediction model for human genomic DNA methylation |journal=International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BIOCOMP'11) |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1186/1755-8794-6-S1-S13"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zheng H, Jiang SW, Li J, Wu H |title=CpGIMethPred: computational model for predicting methylation status of CpG islands in human genome |journal=BMC Medical Genomics |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with biological assay, these methods greatly facilitate the DNA methylation analysis.
