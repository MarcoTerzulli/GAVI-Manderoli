The '''solar power tower''', also known as 'central tower' power plants or '[[heliostat]]' power plants or power towers, is a type of [[solar furnace]] using a tower to receive the focused sunlight. It uses an array of flat, movable mirrors (called heliostats) to focus the sun's rays upon a collector tower (the target). Concentrated solar thermal is seen as one viable solution for renewable, pollution-free energy.

Early designs used these focused rays to heat water, and used the resulting [[steam]] to power a [[turbine]]. Newer designs using liquid [[sodium]] have been demonstrated, and systems using molten salts (40% [[potassium nitrate]], 60% [[sodium nitrate]]) as the [[working fluids]] are now in operation. These working fluids have high [[heat capacity]], which can be used to store the energy before using it to boil water to drive turbines. These designs also allow power to be generated when the sun is not shining.

== Cost ==

In 2017, the US [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL) has estimated that by 2020 electricity could be produced from power towers for 5.47 cents per kWh.&lt;ref name="Avoiding Carbon Apocalypse Through Alternative Energy: Life After Fossil Fuels"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Lowry|title=Avoiding Carbon Apocalypse Through Alternative Energy: Life After Fossil Fuels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1R09DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33|year=2017|publisher=Springer|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, companies such as [[ESolar]] (then backed by [[Google.org]]) were developing cheap, low maintenance, mass producible heliostat components that were to reduce costs in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/20071127_green.html Google's Goal: Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal November 27, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; ESolar's design used large numbers of small mirrors (1.14&amp;nbsp;m²), to reduce costs for installing mounting systems such as concrete, steel, drilling, and cranes.  In October 2017, an article in GreenTech Media suggested that eSolar ceased business in late 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/concentrated-solar-contender-esolar-goes-awol | title = Concentrated Solar Power Contender ESolar Goes AWOL | date = 12 October 2017 | accessdate = 13 June 2019 | last = Deign | first = Jason | work = GreenTech Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improvements in working fluid systems, such as moving from current two tank (hot/cold) designs to single tank thermocline systems with quartzite thermal fillers and oxygen blankets will improve material efficiency and reduce costs further.

* Some concentrating solar power towers are air-cooled instead of water-cooled, to avoid using limited desert water&lt;ref name="brightsourceenergy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightsourceenergy.com/technology/faqs/ |title=FAQs |publisher=Brightsourceenergy.com |date= |accessdate=2019-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flat glass is used instead of the more expensive curved glass&lt;ref name="brightsourceenergy.com" /&gt;
* [[Thermal energy storage|Thermal storage]] to store the heat in molten salt containers to continue producing electricity while the sun is not shining
* Steam is heated to 500&amp;nbsp;°C to drive turbines that are coupled to generators which produce electricity
* Control systems to supervise and control all the plant activity including the heliostat array positions, alarms, other data acquisition and communication.

Generally, installations use from {{convert|150|ha|m2}} to {{convert|320|ha|m2}}.

== Environmental concerns ==
There is evidence that such large area solar concentrating installations can kill birds that fly over them. Near the center of the array temperatures can reach 550 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C which, with the solar flux itself, is enough to incinerate birds while further away feathers are scorched leading to the eventual death of the bird. Workers at the Ivanpah solar power plant call these birds “streamers,” as they ignite in midair and plummet to the ground trailing smoke. During testing of the initial standby position for the heliostats, 115 birds were killed as they entered the concentrated solar flux. During the first 6 months of operations, a total of 321 birds were killed. After altering the standby procedure to focus no more than four heliostats on any one point, there have been no further bird fatalities.&lt;ref name="Kraemer"&gt;{{cite web

== Commercial applications ==

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in solar tower power technology, as is evident from the fact that there are several companies involved in planning, designing and building utility size power plants. This is an important step towards the ultimate goal of developing commercially viable plants. There are numerous examples of case studies of applying innovative solutions to solar power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pointfocus.com/ SOLAR POWER IN THE NEWS]&lt;/ref&gt; Beam down tower application is also feasible with heliostats to heat the working fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helioscsp.com/three-solar-modules-of-worlds-first-commercial-beam-down-tower-concentrated-solar-power-project-to-be-connected-to-grid/ |title=Three solar modules of world’s first commercial beam-down tower Concentrated Solar Power project to be connected to grid |accessdate=18 August 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Novel applications ==
[[Image:Pit Power Tower.gif|thumb|Pit Power Tower concept in [[Bingham Canyon mine]]]]

The Pit Power Tower&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altenergymag.com/emagazine.php?issue_number=09.02.01&amp;article=gwiazda Pit Power Tower - Alternative Energy News Feb 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents/US20050150225 Pit Power Tower US Patent]&lt;/ref&gt; combines a solar power tower and an aero-electric power tower&lt;ref&gt;[[Energy tower]]&lt;/ref&gt; in a decommissioned open pit mine. Traditional solar power towers are constrained in size by the height of the tower and closer heliostats blocking the line of sight of outer heliostats to the receiver. The use of the pit mine's "stadium seating" helps overcome the blocking constraint.

As solar power towers commonly use steam to drive the turbines, and water tends to be scarce in regions with high solar energy, another advantage of open pits is that they tend to collect water, having been dug below the water table. The Pit Power Tower uses low heat steam to drive the pneumatic tubes in a co-generation system. A third benefit of re-purposing a pit mine for this kind of project is the possibility of reusing mine infrastructure such as roads, buildings and electricity.
