'''iPad''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|p|æ|d}} {{respell|EYE|pad}}) is a line of [[tablet computer]]s designed, developed and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]], which run the [[iOS]] and [[iPadOS]]  mobile operating systems.  The [[iPad (1st generation)|first iPad]] was released on April 3, 2010; the most recent iPad models are the [[iPad (2019)|seventh-generation iPad]], released on September 25, 2019; the [[iPad Mini (5th generation)|fifth-generation iPad mini]], released on March 18, 2019; the [[iPad Air (2019)|third-generation iPad Air]], released on March 18, 2019; and the second-generation {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} and fourth-generation {{Convert|12.9|in|mm|adj=on}} [[iPad Pro]], released on March 25, 2020.

The [[user interface]] is built around the device's [[multi-touch]] screen, including a [[virtual keyboard]]. All iPads can connect using [[Wi-Fi]]; some models also have [[Cellular network|cellular]] connectivity. iPads can [[video camera|shoot video]], [[camera phone|take photos]], [[portable media player|play music]], and perform Internet functions such as web-browsing and emailing. Other functions{{snd}} [[Video game|games]], [[reference work|reference]], [[GPS navigation software|GPS navigation]], [[social networking service|social networking]], etc.{{snd}} can be enabled by downloading and installing [[application software|apps]]. {{as of|2016|March|}}, the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] has more than 1 million apps for the iPad by Apple and third parties.

There have been ten [[List of iOS devices#iPad|versions]] of the iPad. The [[iPad (first generation)|first generation]] established design precedents, some of which have persisted through all models. The [[iPad (2nd generation)|second generation]] (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a [[multi-core processor|dual-core]] [[Apple A5]] processor, and VGA front-facing and [[720p]] rear-facing cameras designed for [[FaceTime]] video calling. The [[iPad (third generation)|third generation]] added a [[Retina Display]], the new [[Apple A5X]] processor with a [[Multi-core processor|quad-core]] [[Graphics processing unit|graphics processor]], a 5-[[megapixel]] camera, HD [[1080p]] video recording, [[Digital dictation|voice dictation]], and [[4G]] ([[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]]). The [[iPad (fourth generation)|fourth generation]] added the [[Apple A6X]] processor and replaced the [[30-pin dock connector#Apple 30-pin dock connector|30-pin connector]] with an all-digital [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]]. The [[iPad Air]] added the [[Apple A7]] processor and the [[Apple M7]] motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness for the first time since the iPad 2. The [[iPad Air 2]] added the [[Apple A8X]] processor, the [[Apple M8]] [[Apple motion coprocessors|motion coprocessor]], an 8-megapixel camera, and the [[Touch ID]] [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprint sensor]]; and further reduced the thickness. The [[IPad (2017)|fifth generation]] added the [[Apple A9]] processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements the iPad Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price. The [[iPad (2018)|sixth generation]] has a [[Apple A10 Fusion]] processor and [[Apple Pencil]] support. The [[iPad Air (2019)|third-generation iPad Air]] has a 10.5-inch display, [[Apple A12 Bionic]] processor, and support Apple Pencil and Apple Smart Keyboard. The [[iPad (2019)|seventh generation]] features a bigger 10.2-inch display with the same Apple A10 Fusion processor  and supports Apple Smart Keyboard.

There have been five [[List of iOS devices#iPad Mini|versions]] of the [[iPad Mini]], all of which have a screen size of {{convert|7.9|in|cm}}. The [[iPad Mini (first generation)|first generation]] has similar internal specifications to the iPad 2 but uses the [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]] instead. The [[iPad Mini 2]] added the [[Retina Display]], the [[Apple A7]] processor, and the [[Apple M7]] [[Apple motion coprocessors|motion coprocessor]], closely matching the internal specifications of the iPad Air. The [[iPad Mini 3]] added the [[Touch ID]] fingerprint sensor with the same Apple A7 processor. The [[iPad Mini 4]] features the [[Apple A8]] proceessor and the [[Apple M8]] motion coprocessor, and an upgraded camera. The [[iPad Mini (5th generation)|fifth generation]] features the [[Apple A12 Bionic]] processor and supports Apple Pencil.

There have been four [[List of iOS devices#iPad Pro|generations]] of the [[iPad Pro]]. All generations have included a 12.9" screen size option, with the other being 9.7" in first, 10.5" in second, 11" in third and fourth generations.

Apple co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] said in a 1983 speech&lt;ref name="panzarino20121002"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/10/02/rare-full-recording-of-1983-steve-jobs-speech-reveals-apple-had-been-working-on-ipad-for-27-years|title=Rare full recording of 1983 Steve Jobs speech reveals Apple had been working on iPad for 27 years|website=The Next Web|first=Matthew|last=Panzarino|date=October 2, 2012|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the company's strategy was simple: "What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes ... and we really want to do it with a radio link in it so you don't have to hook up to anything and you're in communication with all of these larger databases and other computers."

Apple's first tablet computer was the [[Newton (platform)|Newton]] [[MessagePad|MessagePad 100]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/the_original_tablet|title=The Original Tablet|website=[[Daring Fireball]]|first=John|last=Gruber|authorlink=John Gruber|date=January 14, 2010|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brad |last=Stone |authorlink=Brad Stone (journalist) |title=Apple Rehires a Developer of Its Newton Tablet |url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/28/apple-rehires-newton-and-nike-marketing-whiz/ |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 28, 2009 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced in 1993, powered by an [[ARM architecture|ARM6]] processor core developed by [[ARM Limited|ARM]], a 1990 spinout of [[Acorn Computers]] in which Apple invested. Apple also developed a prototype [[PowerBook Duo]] based tablet, the [[PowerBook Duo#PenLite|PenLite]], but decided not to sell it in order to avoid hurting MessagePad sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeff |last=Smykil |title=Four Apple prototypes I've never heard of |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2006/11/6141/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=December 1, 2006 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple released several more Newton-based PDAs; the final one, the [[MessagePad|MessagePad 2100]], was discontinued in 1998.

Apple re-entered the mobile-computing markets in 2007 with the [[iPhone]]. Smaller than the iPad, but featuring a camera and mobile phone, it pioneered the [[multi-touch]] finger-sensitive touchscreen interface of Apple's [[iOS]] mobile [[operating system]]. By late 2009, the iPad's release had been rumored for several years. Such speculation mostly talked about "Apple's tablet"; specific names included ''iTablet'' and ''iSlate''.&lt;ref name="engagetrumor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/01/26/the-apple-tablet-a-complete-history-supposedly|title=The Apple Tablet: a complete history, supposedly|first=Laura|last=June|website=[[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=January 26, 2010|accessdate=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPad was announced on January 27, 2010, by Steve Jobs at an Apple press conference at the [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]] in San Francisco.&lt;ref name="Apple PR-Jan"&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2010/01/27Apple-Launches-iPad/|title=Apple Launches iPad|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=January 27, 2010|accessdate=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/business/index.ssf/2010/01/apple_ipad_tablet_is_unveiled.html|title=Apple iPad tablet is unveiled at live press conference|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=January 27, 2010|accessdate=January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jobs later said that Apple had begun developing the iPad before the iPhone.&lt;ref name="keynoteMacworld"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.macworld.com/article/1054764/liveupdate.html|title=Macworld Expo Keynote Live Update|first=Peter|last=Cohen|work=[[Macworld]]|date=January 9, 2007|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=levgrossman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1576854,00.html|title=The Apple Of Your Ear|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|first=Lev|last=Grossman|date=January 12, 2007|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Ive]] in 1991 had created an industrial design for a stylus-based tablet, the Macintosh Folio, as his first project for Apple; by 2004 his studio at the company was participating in the development of a large tablet prototype, which he later described as "very crude, involving projectors". Ive stated that after seeking to produce the tablet first, he came to agree with Jobs that the phone was more important,&lt;ref name="parker20150223"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/23/shape-things-come | title=The Shape of Things to Come | work=The New Yorker | date=February 23, 2015 | accessdate=August 27, 2015 | last=Parker | first=Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the tablet's innovations would work as well in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2010/jun/02/apple-steve-jobs |work= The Guardian |title= Steve Jobs on Adobe, Gizmodo and why iPad came before iPhone |date= June 2, 2010 |accessdate= July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPad's internal codename was K48, which was revealed in the court case surrounding leaking of iPad information before launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Azam |last=Ahmed |title=Executive Pleads Guilty to Leaking Apple Secrets |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/07/05/executive-pleads-guilty-to-leaking-apple-secrets/ |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 5, 2011 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, 2012, Apple announced the [[iPad (fourth generation)|fourth generation iPad]], which began shipping on November 2, 2012. The new hardware includes an [[Apple A6|A6X]] processor, HD FaceTime camera, improved LTE compatibility, and the all-digital [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning]] connector.

Alongside the launch of the fourth generation hardware, Apple announced the [[iPad Mini]]. With a screen measuring 7.9 inches, it is aimed at the emerging sector of [[mini tablets|smaller tablets]] such as the [[Kindle Fire]] and [[Nexus 7 (2012 version)|Nexus 7]]. The hardware of the new iPad Mini is similar to the [[iPad 2]], with a 1,024 by 768 pixel resolution screen and a dual core [[Apple A5|A5]] processor, but is 53% lighter and 7.2&amp;nbsp;mm thick. It was released on November 2, 2012, in 16&amp;nbsp;GB, 32&amp;nbsp;GB, and 64&amp;nbsp;GB capacities and Wi-Fi or Wi‑Fi + Cellular versions.&lt;ref name="appl_prelease_23-10-2012"/&gt;

On October 22, 2013, Apple introduced the fifth generation of iPad, called the [[iPad Air]], and the second generation of iPad Mini, called [[iPad Mini 2]] that comes with a [[Retina Display]]. The iPad Air went on sale on November 1, 2013, starting at $499, while the iPad Mini 2 was released on November 12, 2013, starting at $399.

In the first quarter of 2014, Apple reported that it had sold 25&amp;nbsp;million iPads, an all-time quarterly record, compared to 22.9&amp;nbsp;million in the year-ago quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Darrell |last=Etherington |title=Apple's 51M iPhones, 26M iPads And 4.8M Macs In Q1 2014 Set A Record, But Growth Slows |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/27/apple-q1-2014-iphone-ipad-mac/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=January 27, 2014 |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew |last=Cunningham |title=Apple breaks revenue, iPhone, and iPad records in Q1 of 2014 |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/01/apple-breaks-revenue-iphone-and-ipad-records-in-q1-of-2014/ |website=[[Ars Technica]]  |date=January 27, 2014 |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, Apple released the [[iPad Air 2]] and the [[iPad Mini 3]]. The iPad Air 2 is the first iOS device to feature a triple-core CPU and 2GB of RAM. As well as being thinner and faster than its predecessor, the iPad Air, it features [[Touch ID]] and is available with a gold color option. The iPad Mini 3 is similar to the iPad Mini 2 in design and hardware, but also includes Touch ID and available in gold color.

In September 2015, the [[iPad Pro]] was announced, which included a 12.9-inch screen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Romain |last=Dillet |title=Apple Unveils The iPad Pro |url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/09/apple-unveils-the-ipad-pro/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=September 9, 2015 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 9.7-inch version was announced in March 2016, with the addition of 256&amp;nbsp;GB option for both iPad Pro models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Seifert |title=New iPad Pro announced: $599, 9.7-inch display, weighs less than one pound |url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/21/11256118/apple-new-ipad-price-specs-release-date |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=March 21, 2016 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Husain |last=Sumra |title=Apple Announces 9.7-Inch iPad Pro with Apple Pencil Support, True Tone Display |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/21/apple-9-7-inch-ipad-pro/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=March 21, 2016 |accessdate=March 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2017, a new [[iPad (2017)|iPad]] was announced. The hardware includes an [[Apple A9|A9]] processor and is designed to be a budget version of the iPad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James |last=Vincent |title=Apple replaces iPad Air 2 with cheaper 9.7-inch iPad |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/14998464/apple-replaces-ipad-air-with-cheaper-9-7-inch-ipad |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=March 21, 2017 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware==
===Screen and input===
The iPad's (first two generations) [[touchscreen]] display is a 1,024 by 768 pixel, {{convert|7.75|*|5.82|in|mm|abbr=on}} [[liquid-crystal display]] (diagonal {{convert|9.7|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}), with [[Lipophobicity|fingerprint-]] and scratch-resistant glass. Steve Jobs said a 7-inch screen would be "too small to express the software" and that 10&amp;nbsp;inches was the minimum for a tablet screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bianca |last=Bosker |title=Apple's 'iPad 2' Won't Be A Smaller, 7-Inch Version, Steve Jobs Suggests |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/19/apples-ipad-2-wont-be-a-s_n_767882.html |website=[[The Huffington Post]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the iPhone, the iPad is designed to be controlled by bare fingers; normal, non-conductive gloves and [[stylus|styli]] do not work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Pogue |authorlink=David Pogue |title=Ultimate iPhone FAQs List, Part 2 |url=https://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/01/13/ultimate-iphone-faqs-list-part-2/ |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 13, 2007 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are special gloves and [[Capacitive stylus|capacitive styli]] designed for this use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1146421/ipad_accessories.html |title=Expo Notes: iPad cases, touch gloves hot items on expo floor |work=Macworld |accessdate=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rick |last=Broida |title=Want to take notes on an iPad?

The display responds to other sensors: an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3-axis [[accelerometer]] to sense iPad orientation and switch between [[Page orientation|portrait and landscape]] modes. Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch's built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad's built-in applications support [[screen rotation]] in all four orientations, including upside-down. Consequently, the device has no intrinsic "native" orientation; only the relative position of the home button changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/3640/apples-ipad-the-anandtech-review/4|title=Apple's iPad - The AnandTech Review|first=Anand|last= Lal Shimpi, Brian Klug &amp; Vivek Gowri|publisher=AnandTech|date=April 7, 2010|accessdate=August 9, 2012|page=4|quote=The display rotates smoothly to orient itself properly regardless of how you're holding it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four physical switches on the iPad, including a home button near the display that returns the user to the main menu, and three plastic physical switches on the sides: ''wake/sleep'' and ''volume up/down'', plus a software-controlled switch whose function has changed with software updates. Originally the switch locked the screen to its current orientation, but the iOS 4.2 changed it to a mute switch, with rotation lock now available in an onscreen menu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2010/03/12/ipads-mute-switch-replaced-with-screen-rotation-lock/|title=iPad's 'Mute' Switch Replaced With Screen Rotation Lock |date=March 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 12, 2010 |publisher=[[MacRumors]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the iOS 4.3 update, released with the iPad 2, a setting was added to allow the user to specify whether the side switch was used for rotation lock or mute.&lt;ref name="AppleIPadSpecs" /&gt;

===Camera===
[[File:LiDAR_Scanner_and_Back_Camera_of_iPad_Pro_2020_-_3.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Lidar|LiDAR]] camera]]
The first generation iPad had no camera; the iPad 2 has a front [[VGA]] camera and a rear-facing [[720p]] camera, both capable of still images (but these are only taken at a low quality 0.3 megapixels) and 30[[Frame rate|fps]] video. The rear-facing camera has a 5× [[digital zoom]] for still images only. Both shoot photo and video in a [[4:3]] fullscreen aspect ratio, unlike the [[iPhone 4]], which shoots in a [[16:9]] widescreen aspect ratio. Unlike the iPhone, the iPad does not support tap to focus, but does allow a tap to set auto exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/4225/the-ipad-2-review/8|title=The Apple iPad 2 Review|first1=Brian |last1=Klug |first2=Anand Lal|last2=Shimpi |first3=Vivek |last3=Gowri|date=March 19, 2011|accessdate=July 29, 2012|quote=Tapping on the preview exposes for the tapped region, but since the rear camera is fixed focus, focus doesn't change.|publisher=AnandTech}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cameras allow [[FaceTime]] video messaging with iPhone 4, fourth generation iPod Touch, and [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Snow Leopard]], [[Mac OS X Lion|Lion]], and [[OS X Mountain Lion|Mountain Lion]] [[Macintosh|Macs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/03/02/technology/ipad_2_announcement/|title=IPad 2: Thinner, faster, and with a Steve Jobs surprise|first=David |last=Goldman|publisher=CNNMoney|date=March 2, 2011|accessdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third-generation iPad upgraded its 
iSight rear camera to 5 megapixels with f/2.4 aperture, capable of supporting [[1080p]] [[High-definition video|HD]] video recording at 30fps in a [[16:9]] aspect ratio, while still has the 0.3-megapixel VGA FaceTime front camera found on the previous model. It also supports [[autofocus]], [[image stabilization]], and [[video stabilization]]. 

The fourth-generation iPad and first-generation iPad Mini have the same 5-megapixel iSight camera as the previous model, but with the upgraded 1.2 FaceTime front camera with the 720p HD video recording, panorama support, and Hybrid IR filter support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-4-camera-battery-life-and-verdict-page-4 |url-status=live |title=iPad 4 Review - Camera, Battery Life and Verdict Review |accessdate=April 26, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPad Air, iPad Mini 2, and iPad Mini 3 also has the same features as the previous models, with the addition of the video zoom support. 

The iPad Air 2 has an 8-megapixel rear camera, with a capability to support 720p, 120fps [[slow motion|slo-mo]] video support, Auto-HDR, and burst mode. Its front FaceTime camera improves the low-light performance by up to 80% according to Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/ipad-air-2-camera-page-5 |url-status=live |title=iPad Air 2 Review - Camera Review |accessdate=April 26, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPad Mini 4 and the first-generation 12.9-inch iPad Pro has the same camera features as the iPad Air 2.

The 9.7-inch iPad Pro has a 12-megapixel rear camera with f/2.2 aperture, True Tone Flash, and Live Photos. It also supports [[4K resolution|4K]] video recording at 30fps, 240fps 720p and 120fps 1080p slo-mo recording, and cinematic video stabilization. The front camera also upgraded to 5 megapixels and added Retina Flash.

The fifth, sixth, and seventh-generation iPad have the same camera features as the iPad Air 2, with the addition of Live Photos and Retina Flash that is found on the 9.7 inch iPad Pro and later models.

The second-generation iPad Pro’s rear camera has an aperture f/1.8 with the updated Quad-LED True Tone Flash. The tablets also upgraded the front camera to 7 megapixels. 

The third-generation iPad Pro has the same 12-megapixel rear camera and a TrueDepth camera, with support for Portrait Mode, Portrait Lighting, Animoji and Memoji.

The third-generation iPad Air and the fifth-generation iPad Mini have an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 7-megapixel front camera.
 
The fourth-generation iPad Pro has two cameras: a 12MP wide camera and a 10MP [[Wide-angle lens|ultrawide]] camera, with the apertures of f/1.8 and f/2.4, respectively. The tablets also features the [[LiDAR]] Scanner, for more accurate [[Augmented Reality]] functionality.

===Audio and output===
The iPad has two internal speakers reproducing left and right channel audio located on the bottom-right of the unit. In the original iPad, the speakers push sound through two small sealed channels leading to the three audio ports carved into the device,&lt;ref name="ifixit-teardown-p3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple A4 Teardown|url=https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPad-Teardown/2183/3#s11201|first=Miroslav |last=Djuric |date=April 3, 2010|accessdate=April 17, 2010|website=iFixit}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the iPad 2 has its speakers behind a single grill.&lt;ref name="iPad 2 Wi-Fi Teardown" /&gt; A volume switch is on the right side of the unit. A 3.5-mm [[Phone connector (audio)|TRRS connector]]&lt;!--Yes, two Rs--&gt; audio-out jack on the top-left corner of the device provides stereo sound for headphones with or without microphones and/or volume controls. The iPad also contains a microphone that can be used for [[Sound recording and reproduction|voice recording]].

The built-in [[Bluetooth 2.1|Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR]] interface allows wireless headphones and keyboards to be used with the iPad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.apple.com/ipad/accessories/ |title= iPad - Make your iPad even better with accessories |publisher= [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |accessdate= July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However iOS does not currently support [[Bluetooth protocols#Object exchange (OBEX)|file transfer]] via Bluetooth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/ipads-lack-of-flashusbbluetooth-is-all-about-lock-in-updated/5922 |title= iPad's lack of Flash/USB/Bluetooth is all about lock-in (updated) |date= February 1, 2010 |accessdate= June 19, 2010 |website= [[ZDNet]] |publisher= [[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; iPad also features 1,024×768 VGA video output for limited applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4108 |title= iPad: About iPad Dock Connector to VGA Adapter compatibility |publisher= [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |accessdate= June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; screen capture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.epiphan.com/solutions_new/image-capture/how-to-record-streaming-video-and-images-from-ipad/ |title= How to Record Video and Images from iPad |accessdate= March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting an external display or television through an accessory adapter.

===Battery===
The iPad uses an internal [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable]] [[lithium-ion polymer]] (LiPo) battery. The batteries are made in [[Taiwan]] by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology.&lt;ref name="forbes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.forbes.com/global/2010/0607/best-under-billion-10-raymond-sung-simplo-technology-batteries-requried.html |work= Forbes |title= Best Under a Billion: Batteries Required?|date= June 7, 2010 |accessdate= June 11, 2010 |first= Joyce |last= Huang}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPad is designed to be charged with a high current of 2 amperes using the included 10 W USB power adapter and USB cord with a USB connector at one end and a 30-pin dock connector at the other end. While it can be charged by a standard USB port from a computer, these are limited to 0.5 amps. As a result, if the iPad is running while powered by a normal USB computer port, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer Apple computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4060 |publisher= [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |title= iPad: Charging the battery |accessdate= December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple claims that the battery for both generations of iPad can provide up to 10 hours of video, 140 hours of audio playback, or one month on standby. Like any rechargeable battery technology, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time, but is not designed to be user-replaceable. In a program similar to the battery-replacement program for the [[iPod]] and the original iPhone, Apple will replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished iPad for a fee of US$99 plus $6.95 shipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://gizmodo.com/5492711/apple-will-replace-dead-battery-ipads-for-99 |title= Apple will replace the dead battery of an iPad for $99 |first= Kyle |last= VanHemert |date= March 13, 2010 |accessdate= March 15, 2010 |website=[[Gizmodo]] |publisher= [[Gawker Media]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Apple_iPad_Battery"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/support/ipad/repair/battery-power/ |title=iPad Battery and Power |publisher = [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Support |accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a different unit is supplied, user data is not preserved.

Independent companies also provide a battery replacement service, returning the original unit with a new battery but original case. Alternatively, it is possible for a technically competent user to buy and install a new battery. The task does not require soldering, but is technically challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/ipad/ipad-troubleshooting-repair-faq/ipad-max-battery-life-charging-tips-battery-conservation.html |title= iPad Troubleshooting &amp; Repair Q&amp;A |publisher= Everyipod.com |date= December 8, 2011 |accessdate= July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage===
The iPad was released with three capacity options for storage: 16, 32, or 64&amp;nbsp;GB of internal [[flash memory]]. On January 29, 2013, Apple announced a 128&amp;nbsp;GB model of the [[iPad (fourth generation)|fourth generation iPad]], which was released on February 5.&lt;ref name=Mashable1 /&gt; On March 21, 2016, Apple announced a 256&amp;nbsp;GB model of the [[iPad Pro]], which was released on March 31. In 2017, Apple released a 10.5-inch iPad Pro and a revised 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a 512 GB option, the first of its kind on an iOS device. In 2018, Apple released a 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro, both with a 1{{nbsp}}TB option. 

All data is stored on the internal flash memory, with no option to expand storage. Apple sells a "camera connection kit" with an [[SD card]] reader, but it can only be used to transfer photos and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/apple-ipad-camera-connection-kit/ |title= Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit |first= Jeremy |last= Horwitz |publisher= iLounge |date= April 26, 2010 |accessdate= June 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Apple iOS, in combination with their specific hardware, uses [[crypto-shredding]] when activating the "Erase all content and settings" by [[wiktionary:en:obliterate|obliterating]] all the keys in '[[wiktionary:en:efface|effaceable]] storage'. This renders all user data on the device cryptographically inaccessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Data Sanitization | publisher=[[Stanford University]] | date=September 23, 2014 | url=https://uit.stanford.edu/security/data-sanitization | accessdate=March 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cellular connectivity===
iPad models come in two basic variants: Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi with cellular support. The cellular variants however do not support circuit-switched voice calls and texts, only data connectivity. The side of the [[Wi-Fi]] + [[3G]] iPad had a [[Subscriber identity module#Card sizes|micro-SIM]] slot (not [[Subscriber identity module|mini-SIM]]). The 3G iPad can be used with any compatible [[GSM]] carrier, unlike the iPhone, which is usually sold [[SIM lock|'locked' to specific carriers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Foresman |title=iPad WiFi + 3G day is today; here's our data plan primer |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2010/04/ipad-3g-wifi-day-is-today-heres-our-data-plan-primer/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=April 30, 2010 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the first generations of the iPad in the U.S., data network access via [[T-Mobile US|T-Mobile]]'s network was limited to slower [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] cellular speeds because T-Mobile's 3G Network at the time used different frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple's iPad wireless service to be unlocked, partnered with AT&amp;T |url= http://voices.washingtonpost.com/posttech/2010/01/from_washington_the_most_inter.html |first= Cecilia |last= Kang |date= January 27, 2010 |accessdate= April 26, 2010 |work= [[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Unlocked or Not, Your iPad Won't Be Able to Use T-Mobile's 3G Network |url= https://gizmodo.com/5458423/unlocked-or-not-your-ipad-wont-be-able-to-use-t+mobiles-3g-network |first= Rosa |last=Golijan |date=January 27, 2010|accessdate=April 26, 2010|website=[[Gizmodo]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[iPad (2nd generation)|second generation iPad]] introduced a third tier of models with [[CDMA]] support for [[Verizon Wireless]] in the United States, available separately from the [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]] capable version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2011/03/live-coverage-apple-expected-to-unveil-new-ipad/1 |title= Apple launching iPad 2 on March 11 |first= Ed |last= Baig |work= [[USA Today]] |publisher= [[Gannett Company]] |date= March 2, 2011 |accessdate= March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPad up to the 4th generation uses a Micro-SIM, while the first-generation iPad Mini uses a nano-SIM as introduced with the iPhone 5. The iPad mini is available with two different frequency bands worldwide. Both devices support the same quad-band GSM and quad-band UMTS frequencies, but one variant also supports LTE bands 4 and 17 (principally intended for use on the U.S. AT&amp;T network), while the other adds support for [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25 and CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B.

The 5th generation iPad and 2nd generation iPad mini introduced support for many additional LTE bands worldwide. The iPad Air and Mini with Retina display cellular models come in two variants each, all of which support nano-SIMs, quad-band GSM, pentaband UMTS, and dual-band CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and B. Additionally, one variant of each iPad also supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25 and 26 while the other variant supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 and [[Time-Division Long-Term Evolution|TD-LTE]] bands 38, 39 and 40. Apple's ability to handle many different bands in one device allowed it to offer, for the first time, a single iPad variant that supports all the cellular bands and technologies deployed by all the major North American wireless providers at the time of the device's introduction. Moreover, with T-Mobile USA selling the iPad Air and Mini with Retina display, these models became the first iPads that were made available for purchase directly from all four nationwide U.S. wireless carriers (and, as previously indicated, with all U.S. carriers now selling the same hardware variant of the device).

===Accessories===
{{Main|iPad accessories}}
Apple offers several iPad accessories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=iPad must-haves. And fun-to-haves |url=https://www.apple.com/ipad/accessories/ |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which are adapters for the proprietary 30-pin [[dock connector]], the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack.&lt;ref name="AppleIPadSpecs" /&gt; A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line out port. Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock. A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://9to5mac.com/2011/03/25/schiller-no-ipad-2-keyboard-dock-use-the-soft-keyboard/ |title= Schiller: No iPad 2 keyboard dock, use the soft keyboard |publisher= 9 to 5 Mac |date= March 25, 2011 |accessdate= August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with [[Macintosh|Macs]] and [[personal computer|PCs]]. The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter ("wall charger") also used for iPods and iPhones, and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad.

Apple sells a camera connection kit that consists of two separate adapters for the dock connector, one to [[USB]] Type A, the other an [[Secure Digital|SD]] card reader. Adapter can be used to transfer photos and videos and to plug USB [[USB sound card|audio card]]
or [[MIDI keyboard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4101 |title= iPad: Using the iPad Camera Connection Kit |accessdate= November 27, 2011 |publisher= [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A third party sells an adapter that includes USB, SD, and [[MicroSD]] on a single unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first= Darren |last= Murph |title= Knockoff 3-in-1 iPad camera connection kit improves Apple's own design |url= https://www.engadget.com/2010/12/14/knockoff-3-in-1-ipad-camera-connection-kit-improves-apples-own/ |website= [[Engadget]] |publisher= [[AOL]] |date= December 14, 2010 |accessdate= March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An adapter to [[VGA connector]]s allows the iPad to work with external monitors and projectors. Another adapter mirrors the screen onto [[HDMI]] compatible devices in 1080p and works with all apps and rotations. Unlike other adapters, it allows the iPad to charge through another dock connector.&lt;ref name="Macworld"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.macworld.com/article/1158263/ipadcovers.html |title= Smart Cover, Digital AV adapter accompany iPad 2 launch |accessdate= March 2, 2011 |first= Jackie |last= Dove |date= March 2, 2011 |work= Macworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the HDMI adapter was released with and advertised for the [[iPad (second generation)|second generation iPad]], it also works with the first-generation iPad, the [[iPhone 4]], and the fourth generation iPod Touch.&lt;ref name=AVadapter&gt;{{cite web|title= Apple Digital AV Adapter |url= http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD098ZM/A |publisher= [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |accessdate= March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart Covers are screen protectors that magnetically attach and align to the face of the iPad 2, 3, or 4. The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also held together by magnets.&lt;ref name=SmartCoverTeardown&gt;{{cite web|title= iPad 2 Smart Cover Teardown|url= https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPad-2-Smart-Cover-Teardown/5089/1 |publisher= iFixit |accessdate= March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a [[microfiber]] bottom that cleans the front of the iPad (which wakes up when the cover is removed). There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive. Smart Covers are not compatible with the original iPad.&lt;ref name="Apple Smart Covers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/ipad/smart-cover|title=Apple – Smart Cover|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|date=March 2, 2011|accessdate=March 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307213920/https://www.apple.com/ipad/smart-cover/|archive-date=March 7, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, Apple started selling the Smart Case - a case with the combined function of a smart cover and a back protection case which is compatible with the iPad 2, and iPad 3rd &amp; 4th generation devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2405949,00.asp|title=Apple iPad Smart Case Review|website=[[PC Magazine]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|first=Eugene|last=Kim|date=June 18, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
{{Main|iPadOS|iOS|iOS version history}}

On September 1, it was announced the iPad would get iOS 4.2 by November 2010;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Stein |title=iPad to get iOS 4.2 in November |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/ipad-to-get-ios-4-2-in-november/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=September 1, 2010 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to fulfill this Apple released iOS 4.2.1 to the public on November 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1155883/ios42_release.html|title=Apple releases iOS 4.2.1|first=Jason|last=Snell|work=[[Macworld]]|date=November 22, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interface===

The [[Graphical user interface|interface]] is centred around the home screen, a graphical list of available applications. The home screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button below the screen, closing an open application in the process.&lt;ref name="home screen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/iphone/features/homescreen.html|title= Apple&amp;nbsp;– iPhone&amp;nbsp;– Features&amp;nbsp;– Home screen|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|year=2008|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2019}}

Users can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons, and the dock holds up to six icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs, however, may not be removed.

Almost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using [[multi-touch]]. The iPad's [[interaction technique]]s enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as "[[Multi-touch|pinching]]".

Scrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.

Other [[User-centered design|user-centered]] [[interactive design|interactive]] effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a "back" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.

===Multimedia===
The layout of the music library is similar to an [[iPod]] or current{{when|date=July 2019}} [[Symbian]] [[S60 (software platform)|S60]] phones. The iPad can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, [[playlist]]s, [[genre]]s, composers, [[podcast]]s, [[audiobook]]s, and [[Compilation album|compilations]]. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from [[iTunes]]. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.

Users can rotate their device horizontally to [[Page orientation|landscape mode]] to access [[Cover Flow]], likewise this feature may be disabled if purposely wishing to view a screen from another angle. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks.

The iPad supports [[gapless playback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |title= What is Gapless Playback? |accessdate= May 13, 2008 |publisher= [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Inc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080508053830/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |archivedate= May 8, 2008 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[iPod Classic#Fifth generation|fifth-generation iPods]] introduced in 2005, the iPad can play [[digital video]], allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in [[widescreen]]. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and [[4:3|fullscreen]] video playback.

The iPad allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPad. It includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the [[#Camera|camera]]. The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPad's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from [[iPhoto]] or [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] on a Mac, or [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] on a Windows [[personal computer|PC]].

===Internet connectivity===
The iPad can use Wi-Fi network [[trilateration]] from [[Skyhook Wireless]] to provide location information to applications such as [[Google Maps]]. The 3G model supports [[Assisted GPS|A-GPS]] to allow its position to be calculated with GPS or relative to nearby cellphone towers; it also has a black strip on the back to aid 3G reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.zdnet.com/blog/apple/apple-ipad-does-it-have-real-gps-updated-yes-and-no/5898 |title= Apple iPad: Does it have 'real' GPS? (updated: yes and no) |website= [[ZDNet]] |publisher= [[CBS Interactive]] |date= January 28, 2010 |accessdate= January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPad has a [[Phone connector (audio)|headphone jack]] and a proprietary Apple [[dock connector]], but no [[Ethernet]] or USB port.&lt;ref name="AppleIPadSpecs"/&gt; However, the Apple Camera Connection Kit accessory provides two dock connector adapters for importing photos and videos via USB and SD memory cards.

===Applications===
The iPad comes with several applications, including Safari, Mail, Photos, Video, iPod, [[iTunes]], App Store, [[Apple Books]], [[Apple Maps|Maps]], Notes, Calendar, and Contacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The amazing iPad apps, built right in |url=https://www.apple.com/ipad/built-in-apps/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316162217/http://www.apple.com/ipad/built-in-apps/ |publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] |archivedate=March 16, 2011 |accessdate=April 8, 2017 |url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several are improved versions of applications developed for the iPhone or [[Macintosh|Mac]]. The apps currently missing are the weather, calculator, and health apps.

The iPad syncs with iTunes on a Mac or Windows PC.&lt;ref name="Apple PR-Jan"/&gt; Apple ported its [[iWork]] suite from the Mac to the iPad, and sells pared down versions of [[Pages (word processor)|Pages]], [[Numbers (spreadsheet)|Numbers]], and [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]] apps in the App Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeff |last=Smykil |title=The keyboardless Office: a review of iWork for iPad |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2010/04/iwork-for-ipad-clever-subtitle-goes-here/4/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=April 20, 2010 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the iPad is not designed to replace a mobile phone, a user can use a wired headset or the built-in speaker and microphone and place telephone calls over Wi-Fi or 3G using a [[VoIP]] application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2010/01/apple-confirms-3g-voip-apps-on-ipad-iphone-ipod-touch-skype-is-waiting.html |title= Apple confirms 3G VoIP apps on iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch; Skype is waiting |work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |first= David |last= Sarno |date= January 29, 2010 |accessdate= February 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2012|June|}}, there were about {{formatnum:225000}} iPad specific apps on the App Store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.macworld.com/article/1167183/wwdc_tim_cook_runs_down_the_numbers.html |title= WWDC: Apple runs down the numbers |work= [[Macworld]] |date= June 11, 2012 |first= Joel |last= Mathis |accessdate= August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=September 2018}}

==Restrictions==
===Digital rights management===
{{details|topic=the digital rights management restrictions|iOS (Apple)#Digital rights management}}
The iPad does not employ [[digital rights management]] (DRM), but the OS prevents users from copying or transferring certain content outside of Apple's platform without authorization, such as TV shows, movies, and apps. Also, the iPad's development model requires anyone creating an app for the iPad to sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] and pay for a developer subscription. Critics argue Apple's centralized app approval process and control of the platform itself could stifle software innovation. Of particular concern to [[digital rights]] advocates is Apple's ability to remotely disable or delete apps on any iPad at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/feb/01/apple-ipad-choke-innovation |title=Apple iPad will choke innovation, say open internet advocates |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=February 1, 2010 |first=Bobbie |last=Johnson |accessdate=February 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apple.slashdot.org/story/10/01/31/1657233/Apples-Trend-Away-From-Tinkering|title=Apple's Trend Away From Tinkering|date=January 31, 2010|accessdate=February 12, 2010|website=[[Slashdot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="criticism-eff"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/03/iphone-developer-program-license-agreement-all |title=All Your Apps Are Belong to Apple: The iPhone Developer Program License Agreement |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital rights advocates, including the [[Free Software Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/iphone | title=Apple's iOS: smaller package, bigger restrictions | publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] | date=May 19, 2011 | accessdate=January 28, 2013 | last=Lee | first=Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]],&lt;ref name="criticism-eff"/&gt; and computer engineer and activist [[Brewster Kahle]],{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} have criticized the iPad for its digital rights restrictions. In April 2010, Paul Sweeting, an analyst with [[GigaOM]], was quoted by ''National Public Radio'' as saying, "With the iPad, you have the anti-Internet in your hands. ... It offers [the major media companies] the opportunity to essentially re-create the old business model, wherein they are pushing content to you on their terms rather than you going out and finding content, or a search engine discovering content for you." But Sweeting also thought that the limitations imposed by Apple impart the feeling of a safe neighborhood, saying, "Apple is offering you a gated community where there's a guard at the gate, and there's probably maid service, too." [[Laura Sydell]], the article's author, concludes, "As more consumers have fears about security on the Internet, viruses, and malware, they may be happy to opt for Apple's gated community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125561844 |title=Apple's iPad: The End Of The Internet As We Know It? |date=April 5, 2010 |website=[[NPR|National Public Radio]] (NPR) |first=Laura |last=Sydell|authorlink=Laura Sydell |accessdate=April 23, 2010 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian government has switched from iPads to Android devices over security concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/27/russia_bans_apple_ipad_over_security_concerns/ |title=Putin and pals dump Apple's iPads for Samsung slabs... over security concerns |last1=Hamill |first1=Jasper |date=March 27, 2014 |work=[[The Register]] |accessdate=March 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jailbreaking===
{{main|iOS jailbreaking}}
Like other iOS devices, the iPad can be "jailbroken", depending on which version of [[iOS]] or [[iPadOS]] it is running, thus allowing applications and programs that are not authorized by Apple to run on the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/05/ipad-jailbreak-ready-for-download/|title=iPad Jailbreak Ready for Download|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=May 3, 2010|accessdate=May 8, 2010|first=Charlie |last=Sorrel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gizmodo-iPad-jailbreak" /&gt; Once it is jailbroken, users are able to download many applications previously unavailable through the App Store via unofficial installers such as [[Cydia]], as well as illegally [[Copyright infringement of software|pirated]] applications.&lt;ref name="Gizmodo-iPad-jailbreak" /&gt; Apple claims jailbreaking "can" void the factory warranty on the device in the United States even though jailbreaking is legal.&lt;ref name="Gizmodo-iPad-jailbreak"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5533921/how-to-jailbreak-any-iphone-ipod-touch-or-ipad|title=How To: Jailbreak Any iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad|date=May 8, 2010|accessdate=May 8, 2010|first=John |last=Herrman|website=[[Gizmodo]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cultofmac.com/52463/apples-official-response-to-dmca-jailbreak-exemption-it-voids-your-warranty/52463/&lt;/ref&gt; The iPad, released in April 2010, was first jailbroken in May 2010 with the Spirit jailbreak for iOS version 3.1.2.&lt;ref name="spirit-register"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/03/ipad_jailbreak/ |title= Hackers release jailbreak for iPad and newer iPhones |first= Dan |last=Goodin |date= May 3, 2010 |work= [[The Register]] |accessdate=October 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPad can be jailbroken on iOS versions 4.3 through 4.3.3 with the web-based tool [[JailbreakMe]] 3.0 (released in July 2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mathew J. |last=Schwartz |title=Apple iOS Zero-Day PDF Vulnerability Exposed |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/231001147 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710123801/http://www.informationweek.com/news/231001147 |website=[[InformationWeek]] |publisher=[[UBM plc]] |date=July 7, 2011 |archivedate=July 10, 2011 |accessdate=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on iOS versions including 5.0 and 5.0.1 using [[redsn0w]]&lt;ref name="howto-ios5"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/242116/how_to_jailbreak_your_ios_5_device.html |title= How to Jailbreak Your iOS 5 Device |first= Sarah Jacobsson |last=Purewal |date= October 18, 2011 |publisher= [[International Data Group|IDG]] |website=[[PC World]] |accessdate=October 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Absinthe 2.0 was released on May 25, 2012 as the first jailbreak method for all iOS 5.1.1 devices except the 32&amp;nbsp;nm version of the iPad 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.engadget.com/2012/05/25/absinthe-2-0-jailbreak/ | title=Absinthe 2.0 hits the download wire, jailbreaks all iOS 5.1.1 devices but the 32nm iPad 2 | website=[[Engadget]]|publisher=[[AOL]] | date=May 25, 2012 | accessdate=May 27, 2012 | first=Zach |last=Honig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censorship===
Apple's App Store, which provides iPhone and iPad applications, imposes censorship of content, which has become an issue for book publishers and magazines seeking to use the platform. ''The Guardian'' newspaper described the role of Apple as analogous to that of British magazine distributor [[WH Smith]], which for many years imposed content restrictions.&lt;ref name="Schofield"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/may/10/ipad-apple|title=Wikipedia's porn purge, and cleaning up for the iPad|first=Jack |last=Schofield|date=May 10, 2010|work=The Guardian  |location=UK|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the exclusion of pornography from the App Store, [[YouPorn]] and others changed their video format from [[Adobe Flash#Flash Video|Flash]] to [[H.264]] and [[HTML5]] specifically for the iPad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Lydia |last=Leavitt |title=NSFW Guide to Watching Porn on your iPad |url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/24/ipad-porn-private/ |website=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=April 24, 2010 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an e-mail exchange&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Ryan |last=Tate |title=Steve Jobs Offers World 'Freedom From Porn' |url=http://gawker.com/5539717/steve-jobs-offers-world-freedom-from-porn |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519130516/http://gawker.com/5539717/steve-jobs-offers-world-freedom-from-porn |url-status=live |website=[[Gawker]] |publisher=[[Univision Communications]] |date=May 15, 2010 |archivedate=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Ryan Tate from [[Valleywag]], Steve Jobs claimed that the iPad offers "freedom from porn", leading to many upset replies including [[Adbusting]]s in Berlin by artist Johannes P.

==Reception==
On May 28, 2010, the iPad was released in Australia, Canada, and Japan, as well as in several larger [[European Union|European]] countries. Media reaction to the launch was mixed. The media noted the positive response from fans of the device, with thousands of people queued on the first day of sale in a number of these countries.&lt;ref name="BBC-iPad-launch"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10182143|title=iPad fans mob Apple stores for international launch|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=May 28, 2010|accessdate=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iRua5MeVoFRQ-PC_uTJ1OUYwNJpw|title=iPad-mania as thousands queue for global roll-out|work=[[Google News]]|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|publisher=[[Google]]|date=May 28, 2010|accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to the announcement===
Media reaction to the iPad announcement was mixed. [[Walter Mossberg]] wrote, "It's about the software, stupid", meaning hardware features and build are less important to the iPad's success than software and user interface, his first impressions of which were largely positive. Mossberg also called the price "modest" for a device of its capabilities, and praised the ten-hour battery life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allthingsd.com/20100127/apple-ipad-impressions|title=First Impressions of the New Apple iPad|first=Walter S.|last=Mossberg|authorlink=Walter Mossberg|work=[[All Things Digital]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|date=January 27, 2010|accessdate =January 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, including ''[[PC Advisor]]'' and the ''Sydney Morning Herald'', wrote that the iPad would also compete with proliferating [[netbook]]s, most of which use [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/gadget/3211316/apple-ipad-versus-netbook-features-compared|title=Apple iPad versus netbook: features compared|first=Eric|last=Lai|website=PC Advisor|date=January 28, 2010|accessdate=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/computers/ipad-vs-the-kindle-tablets-and-netbooks-20100202-n9jf.html|title=iPad vs the Kindle, tablets and netbooks|first=Simon|last=Tsang|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=February 2, 2010|accessdate=February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base model's $499 price was lower than pre-release estimates by the tech press, [[Wall Street]] analysts, and Apple's competitors, all of whom were expecting a much higher entry price point.&lt;ref name="FastCompany-price"&gt;{{cite web|title=The iPad's Biggest Innovation: Its $500 Price|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/article/apples-tablet-introduced?page=0%2C0|first=Kit|last=Eaton|date=January 27, 2010|accessdate=March 7, 2010|website=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201050610/http://www.fastcompany.com/article/apples-tablet-introduced?page=0%2C0|archivedate=February 1, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJ Price"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704094304575029621430370074 |title=Apple's iPad Revolution: Price|first=Martin|last=Peers|date=January 28, 2010|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company]]|accessdate=February 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jon |last=Stokes |title=Tablet makers rethinking things in wake of iPad's $499 price |url=https://arstechnica.com/apple/2010/01/tablet-makers-rethinking-things-in-wake-of-ipads-low-price/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=January 29, 2010 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[CNET]]'' also criticized the iPad for its apparent lack of wireless sync which other portable devices such as Microsoft's [[Zune]] have had for a number of years. The built-in iTunes app is able to download from the [[Internet]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Matt |last=Rosoff |title=How to make the iPad a better music device |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/how-to-make-the-ipad-a-better-music-device/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=January 30, 2010 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
Reviews of the iPad have been generally favorable. [[Walt Mossberg]] then, of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' called it a "pretty close" laptop killer.&lt;ref name=atd-review&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 31, 2010 |url=http://allthingsd.com/20100331/apple-ipad-review/ |title=Apple iPad Review: Laptop Killer?

In the former section, he notes that a laptop offers more features for a cheaper price than the iPad. In his review for the latter audience, however, he claims that if his readers like the concept of the device and can understand what its intended uses are, then they will enjoy using the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Pogue |authorlink=David Pogue |title=Looking at the iPad From Two Angles |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/technology/personaltech/01pogue.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PC Magazine]]'s Tim Gideon wrote, "you have yourself a winner" that "will undoubtedly be a driving force in shaping the emerging tablet landscape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 1, 2010|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2362042,00.asp|title=Apple iPad (Wi-Fi)|website=[[PC Magazine]]|date=March 31, 2010|first=Tim|last=Gideon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Arrington of [[TechCrunch]] said, "the iPad beats even my most optimistic expectations.

===Recognition===
The iPad was selected by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the 50 Best Inventions of the Year 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2029497_2030652,00.html|title=The 50 Best Inventions of 2010: iPad|first=Harry |last=McCracken|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Popular Science]] chose it as the top gadget&lt;ref name="psGadg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/bown/2010/category/gadgets|title=Best of What's New 2010: Gadgets|publisher=Popular Science|accessdate=December 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; behind the overall "Best of What's New 2010" winner [[Groasis Waterboxx]].&lt;ref name="psAw"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark |last=Jannot|url=http://www.popsci.com/announcements/article/2010-11/best-whats-new-2010-our-100-innovations-year|title=Best of What's New 2010: Our 100 Innovations of the Year|publisher=Popular Science|accessdate=December 16, 2010|date=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
===Market share===
iPad tablets still{{when|date=March 2019}} have a wide margin globally on second most used Android tablets. The market share, however, differs widely by regions; and the iPad has lost market share globally, every year since 2012 (when StatCounter started tracking tablets separately).&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/#tablet-os-ww-yearly-2012-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[StatCounter]] statistics, that tracks web use and gives operating system/platform share based on it, the iPad has lost majority of use in South America to Android,&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/#tablet-os-sa-quarterly-201301-201602&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/#tablet-os-sa-weekly-201233-201622&lt;/ref&gt; did also lose majority while gaining back in Asia&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/#tablet-os-as-monthly-201305-201605&lt;/ref&gt; and in Africa has lost by a wide margin, where Android is up to 70%.&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/#tablet-os-af-monthly-201305-201605&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business===

While the iPad is mostly used by consumers, it also has been taken up by business users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1= Charles |last1= Arthur |first2= Killian |last2= Fox |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/27/ipad-tablet-computer-users-rivals |title= How the iPad revolution has transformed working lives |work= The Guardian |date= March 27, 2011 |accessdate= August 30, 2011 |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within 90 days of its release, the iPad managed to penetrate 50% of Fortune 100 companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.datamation.com/mobile-wireless/the-ipad-and-enterprise-it.html |title= How the iPad Conquered the Enterprise |date= July 29, 2011 |first= Nathan |last= Clevenger |accessdate= July 29, 2012 |work= Datamation }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some companies are adopting iPads in their business offices by distributing or making available iPads to employees. Examples of uses in the workplace include attorneys responding to clients, medical professionals accessing health records during patient exams, and managers approving employee requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/351462/iPad_Creeping_Into_Business_Offices |title= iPad creeping into business offices |website= [[Computerworld]] |date= September 13, 2010 |accessdate= July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.forbes.com/2010/09/10/ipad-apple-blackberry-technology-cio-network-tablets.html |title= Rise Of The Tablet Computer |work= Forbes |date= September 13, 2010 |first= Ed |last= Sperling |accessdate= July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703846604575447531699309858 |title= Businesses Add iPads to Their Briefcases |work= [[The Wall Street Journal]] |date= August 24, 2010 |first= Ben |last= Worthen |publisher= [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]] |accessdate= July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey by [[Frost &amp; Sullivan]] shows that iPad usage in office workplaces is linked to the goals of increased employee productivity, reduced paperwork, and increased revenue. The research firm estimates that "The mobile-office application market in North America may reach $6.85&amp;nbsp;billion in 2015, up from an estimated $1.76&amp;nbsp;billion [in 2010]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2010-11-02/microstrategys-corporate-apps-boost-productivitybusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice |title=MicroStrategy's Corporate Apps Boost Productivity |date=November 1, 2010 |website=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |quote=About 42% of respondents in the survey, which was released in August, sought an increase in user productivity, followed by reduced paperwork (39%), and increased revenue (37%).

Since March 2011, the US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) has approved the iPad for in-cockpit use to cut down on the paper consumption in several airlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kate |last=Murphy |title=The Paperless Cockpit |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/05/business/05pilots.html |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 4, 2011 |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Alaska Airlines]] became the first airline to replace pilots' paper manuals with iPads, weighing {{Convert|0.68|kg|lb|abbr=on}} compared to {{Convert|11|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for the printed flight manuals.

===Education and healthcare===
The iPad has several uses in the classroom,&lt;ref name="classroom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teleread.com/ipad/teaching-with-the-ipad-first-days|title=Teleread.com: Teaching with the iPad|date=|accessdate=October 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been praised as a valuable tool for homeschooling.&lt;ref name="homeschool2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spottybanana.com/2010/04/13/ipad-in-the-homeschool|publisher=Spotty Banana|title=iPad in the Homeschool|accessdate=October 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="homeschool3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2010/01/how-will-the-apple-tablet-change-our-kids-lives|title= How Will the Apple iPad Change Our Kids' Lives?|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|first=Jenny|last=Williams|date=January 27, 2010|accessdate=October 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the iPad was released, it was reported that 81% of the top book apps were for children.&lt;ref name="children"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aolnews.com/2010/04/27/for-ipad-81-percent-of-top-book-apps-are-kids-titles|title=81 Percent of Top Book Apps Are Kids Titles|publisher=[[AOL News]]|accessdate=October 1, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229065848/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/04/27/for-ipad-81-percent-of-top-book-apps-are-kids-titles/|archivedate=December 29, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPad has also been called a revolutionary tool to help children with autism learn how to communicate and socialize more easily.&lt;ref name="autism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/2010-08-11/news/ihelp-for-autism|title=iHelp for Autism|work=[[SF Weekly]]|first= Ashley|last=Harrell|date=October 1, 2010|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the healthcare field, iPads and iPhones have been used to help hospitals manage their [[Supply chain management|supply chain]]. For example, Novation, a healthcare contracting services company, developed VHA PriceLynx (based on the mobile application platform of business intelligence software vendor MicroStrategy), a [[business intelligence]] app to help health care organizations manage its purchasing procedures more efficiently and save money for hospitals. Guillermo Ramas of Novation states, "Doctors won't walk around a hospital with a laptop. With an iPad it's perfect to walk around the hospital with as long as they have the information they need."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Health-Care-IT/MicroStrategy-App-for-iPhone-iPad-Helps-Hospitals-Manage-Supply-Chain-424068|title=Novation App for iPhone, iPad Helps Hospitals Manage Supply Chain|first=Brian|last=Horowitz|date= August 22, 2011|accessdate= July 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Gianna Chien (aged 14) presented to more than 8,000 doctors at the Heart Rhythm Society meeting that the Apple iPad 2 can, in some cases, interfere with life-saving heart devices ([[artificial cardiac pacemaker|pacemaker]]s) because of the magnets inside.&lt;ref name="BB device failure issue 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-09/heart-patient-risk-from-ipad2-found-by-14-year-old|title=Heart Patient Risk From iPad2 Found by 14-Year-Old|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|first=Michelle Fay|last=Cortez|date=May 9, 2013|accessdate=July 26, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPad User Guide advised pacemaker users to keep iPads at least {{Convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} away from the pacemaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Myth killer: iPad magnet effect on defibrillators wasn't "discovered" by a 14-year-old | website=Engadget | date=May 10, 2013 | url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/10/myth-killer-ipad-magnet-effect-on-defibrillators-wasnt-discov/ | access-date=July 26, 2019 | quote=iPad has magnets along the left edge of the device and on the right side of the front glass, which may interfere with pacemakers, defibrillators, or other medical devices.

===Consumer usage===
In the United States, fans attending [[Super Bowl XLV]], the first Super Bowl since the iPad was released, could use an official [[National Football League]] (NFL) app to navigate [[Cowboys Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/playbook/2011/02/super-bowl-nerve-center|title=Cowboys Stadium Techs Up for Super Bowl Close-Up|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|first=Erik|last=Malinowski|date=February 1, 2011|accessdate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] became the first NFL club to discontinue the use of paper copies of playbooks, and instead distributed all players their playbook and videos in electronic format via an [[iPad 2]].&lt;ref name="TB.com TBB stop paper 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/football/bucs/article1187879.ece|title=Tampa Bay Buccaneers buy each player an iPad to hold playbook, videos|work=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|first=Rick|last=Stroud|date=August 25, 2011|accessdate=August 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913035508/http://www.tampabay.com/sports/football/bucs/article1187879.ece|archive-date=September 13, 2011|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPad is able to support many music creation applications in addition to the iTunes music playback software. These include sound samplers, guitar and voice effects processors, sequencers for synthesized sounds and sampled loops, virtual synthesizers and drum machines, theremin-style and other touch responsive instruments, drum pads and many more. [[Gorillaz]]'s 2010 album, ''[[The Fall (Gorillaz album)|The Fall]]'', was created almost exclusively using the iPad by [[Damon Albarn]] while on tour with the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/11968925|title=Gorillaz are to release a free album on Christmas Day|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=December 10, 2010|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for [[Luna Sea]]'s 2012 single, "[[The End of the Dream/Rouge|Rouge]]", was filmed entirely on an iPad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=LUNA SEA、"第二期"の序章を告げる最新MVはiPadで撮影| url=http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000084699| language=ja|date=November 15, 2012| website=barks.jp| accessdate=December 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPad has greatly increased [[social television]] use. Viewers can use the iPad as a convenient second networked computer (or "[[second screen]]") for communicating with other viewers or with the television provider. Viewers can use a web browser or specialized applications to discuss a program with other viewers, while it is being broadcast, while content providers may use the second screen to interact with viewers in real time. For example, the latter facility allows content providers to conduct real-time polls or to collect comments about the program, that can be displayed as text on the main television screen. Viewer interaction via a second screen is becoming increasingly popular.&lt;ref name="adweek 2nd screen 1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/second-screen-apps-explode-132237|title=Second Screen Apps Explode|work=[[Adweek]]|date=June 7, 2011|accessdate=February 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
