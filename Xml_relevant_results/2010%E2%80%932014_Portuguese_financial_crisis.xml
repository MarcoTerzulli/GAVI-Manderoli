===2000s economic crisis===
Unlike other European countries that were also severely hit by the Great Recession in the late 2000s and received bailouts in the early 2010s (such as [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greece]] and [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|Ireland]]), in Portugal the 2000s were not marked by economic growth, but instead were already a period of economic crisis, marked by stagnation, two recessions (in 2002–03&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.publico.pt/2003/03/13/economia/noticia/portugal-entrou-em-recessao-no-quarto-trimestre-de-2002-284735 |title=Portugal entrou em recessão no quarto trimestre de 2002 |last=Melo |first=Eduardo |date=13 March 2003 |website= |publisher=Público |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Portugal entered recession in the fourth quarter of 2002 |access-date=5 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GDP growth" /&gt; and 2008–09&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/economia/portugal-fechou-2008-em-recessao_v183214 |title=Portugal fechou 2008 em recessão |last= |first= |date=13 February 2009 |website= |publisher=RTP |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Portugal ended 2008 in recession |access-date=5 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GDP growth" /&gt;) and government-sponsored fiscal austerity in order to reduce the budget deficit to the limits allowed by the European Union's [[Stability and Growth Pact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.publico.pt/2002/06/28/jornal/medidas-de-austeridade-poderao-evitar-multas-por-defice-excessivo-172124 |title=Medidas de austeridade poderão evitar multas por défice excessivo |last=Arriaga e Cunha |first=Isabel |date=28 June 2002 |website= |publisher=Público |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Austerity measures may avoid fines due to excessive deficit |access-date=28 June 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 March 2004 |title=Stability pays |url=http://www.economist.com/node/2545844 |newspaper=The Economist |access-date=5 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cambon |first=Diane |date=27 June 2008 |title=Budget, impôts, retraite : la leçon d'austérité du Portugal |trans-title=Bugdet, taxes, reforms: Portugal's lesson of austerity |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/economie/2008/06/27/04001-20080627ARTFIG00357-budget-impots-retraite-la-lecon-d-austerite-du-portugal.php |language=French |newspaper=Le Figaro |access-date=5 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2002 Portuguese legislative election|2002 snap election]] brought to power the [[Social Democrats]] led by [[José Manuel Durão Barroso]]; his government was marked by the introduction of harsh fiscal austerity policies and structural reforms, mainly justified by the need to reduce the budget deficit, a set of policies designed by his Finance Minister [[Manuela Ferreira Leite]].{{sfn|Commission of the European Communities|2005|p=8}} Portuguese economy grew a combined 0.8% in 2002, was in recession in 2003 (-0.9%) and grew 1.6% in 2004.&lt;ref name="GDP growth"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ine.pt/ngt_server/attachfileu.jsp?look_parentBoui=96968544&amp;att_display=n&amp;att_download=y |title=Table A.1.1.8 - Gross domestic product at market prices (volume change rate; annual) |date=2013 |website= |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estatística |access-date=3 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferreira Leite managed to keep deficit on 2.9% both in 2003 and in 2004, but through one-off and extraordinary measures.&lt;ref name="2005 EC Report" /&gt; Otherwise, the deficit would have hit the 5% mark.{{sfn|Commission of the European Communities|2005|p=8}} Meanwhile, the first half of the 2000s also saw the end of the downward trend in the [[Debt-to-GDP ratio|government debt to GDP ratio]] that marked the 1990s: the ratio rose from 53% in 2000 to 62% in 2004 (the ratio overtook the SGP's arbitrary limit of 60% in 2003).{{sfn|Commission of the European Communities|2005|p=13}}

Such hypothesis was eventually the basis for the austerity requested as conditionality for the [[Economic Adjustment Programme for Portugal|2011–2014 European Union/IMF bailout]].&lt;ref name="Portugal, um país de crise em crise" /&gt; For [[Ricardo Reis]], the accession to Euro was a root cause for the 2000s crisis, but for different reasons than the ones put forward by Ferreira do Amaral: the low interest rates allowed an influx of foreign capital, which the country's weak financial system misallocated to the low-productive non-tradable sector, reducing the economy's overall productivity.&lt;ref name="Reis 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reis |first1=Ricardo |date=August 2013 |title=The Portuguese Slump and Crash and the Euro Crisis |journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Economic Studies Program |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=143–210 |doi=10.3386/w19288 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Portugal, um país de crise em crise" /&gt;

Other more structural problems identified were excessive corruption and regulation, which makes difficult for business to get bigger and achieve economies-of-scale,&lt;ref name="The Atlantic 2013" /&gt;

===Anxiety on financial markets===
After the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], it was known in 2008–2009 that two Portuguese banks ([[Banco Português de Negócios]] (BPN) and [[Banco Privado Português]] (BPP)) had been accumulating losses for years due to bad investments, embezzlement and accounting fraud. The case of BPN was particularly serious because of its size, market share, and the political implications - Portugal's then current President, Cavaco Silva, and some of his political allies, maintained personal and business relationships with the bank and its CEO, who was eventually charged and arrested for fraud and other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/bpn-oliveira-costa-vendeu-a-cavaco-e-filha-250-mil-acoes-da-sln=f643506 | title=Expresso &amp;#124; BPN: Oliveira Costa vendeu a Cavaco e filha 250 mil ações da SLN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dn.pt/inicio/portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=1756013 |title=Diário de Notícias |accessdate=2013-05-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816131039/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/portugal/interior.aspx?content_id=1756013 |archivedate=16 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.jn.pt/PaginaInicial/Seguranca/Interior.aspx?content_id=2623133 | title=Dias Loureiro entre os dirigentes do PSD no processo-crime do BPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the grounds of avoiding a potentially serious financial crisis in the Portuguese economy, the Portuguese government decided to give them a bailout, eventually at a future loss to taxpayers.

In the opening weeks of 2010, renewed anxiety about the excessive levels of debt in some EU countries and, more generally, about the health of the Euro spread from Ireland and Greece to Portugal, Spain, and Italy. In 2010, [[PIIGS]] and PIGS acronyms were widely used by international bond analysts, academics, and the international economic press when referring to these under performing economies.

Some senior German policy makers went as far as to say that emergency bailouts to Greece and future EU aid recipients should bring with it harsh penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|en}} {{Citation|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-02-15/merkel-economy-adviser-says-greece-bailout-should-bring-penalty.html |accessdate=15 February 2010 |title=Merkel Economy Adviser Says Greece Bailout Should Bring Penalty |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219060101/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-02-15/merkel-economy-adviser-says-greece-bailout-should-bring-penalty.html |archivedate=19 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Fishman, in the New York Times article "Portugal's Unnecessary Bailout", points out that Portugal fell victim to successive waves of speculation by pressure from bond traders, rating agencies and speculators.&lt;ref name="fishman-portugal"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/opinion/13fishman.html Portugal’s Unnecessary Bailout] – The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; In the first quarter of 2010, before pressure from the markets, Portugal had one of the best rates of economic recovery in the EU. From the perspective of Portugal's industrial orders, exports, entrepreneurial innovation and high-school achievement, the country matched or even surpassed its neighbors in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="fishman-portugal" /&gt; However, the Portuguese economy had been creating its own problems over a lengthy period of time, which came to a head with the financial crisis. Persistent and lasting recruitment policies boosted the number of redundant public servants. Risky credit, public debt creation, and European structural and cohesion funds were mismanaged across almost four decades.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In the summer of 2010, [[Moody's]] Investors Service cut Portugal's [[sovereign bond]] rating down two notches from an Aa2 to an A1&lt;ref&gt;[[Bond credit rating]]s&lt;/ref&gt; Due to spending on economic stimuli, Portugal's [[debt]] had increased sharply compared to the gross domestic product. Moody noted that the rising debt would weigh heavily on the government's short-term finances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/10610673.stm BBC News -Moody's downgrades Portugal debt]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Austerity measures amid increased pressure on government bonds ===
In September 2010, the Portuguese Government announced a fresh austerity package following other [[Eurozone]] partners, through a series of tax hikes and salary cuts for [[public servant]]s. In 2009, the deficit had been 9.4 percent, one of the highest in the Eurozone and well above the [[European Union]]'s [[Stability and Growth Pact]] three percent limit. In November [[risk premium]]s on Portuguese [[bond (finance)|bond]]s hit euro lifetime highs as investors and creditors worried that the country would fail to rein in its budget deficit and debt. The yield on the country's 10-year government bonds reached 7 percent&amp;nbsp;– a level the Portuguese Finance Minister [[Fernando Teixeira dos Santos]] had previously said would require the country to seek financial help from international institutions. Also in 2010, the country reached a record high unemployment rate of nearly 11%, a figure not seen for over two decades, while the number of [[public servant]]s remained very high.

On 23 March 2011, José Sócrates resigned following passage of a [[no confidence]] motion sponsored by all five opposition parties in parliament over spending cuts and tax increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110323-portuguese-parliament-votes-against-austerity-plan-jose-socrates-eurozone |title=Portuguese parliament votes against austerity plan |date=23 March 2011 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |publisher=[[France 24]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of 2011, Portugal requested a €78 billion IMF-EU bailout package in a bid to stabilise its public finances.[128] After the bailout was announced, the Portuguese government headed by Pedro Passos Coelho managed to implement measures to improve the State's financial situation and the country started to be seen as moving on the right track.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} This also led to a strong increase of the unemployment rate to over 15 per cent in the second quarter 2012 and it is expected to rise even further in the near future.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

==Re-access to financial markets==
A positive turning point in Portugal's strive to regain access to financial markets, was achieved on 3 October 2012, when the state managed to convert €3.76 billion of bonds with maturity in September 2013 (carrying a 3.10% yield) to new bonds with maturity in October 2015 (carrying a 5.12% yield). Before the bond exchange, the state had a total of €9.6 billion outstanding notes due in 2013, which according to the bailout plan should be renewed by the sale of new bonds on the market. As Portugal was already able to renew one-third of the outstanding bonds at a reasonable yield level, the market now expect the upcoming renewals in 2013 also to be conducted at reasonable yield levels. The bailout funding programme will run until June 2014, but at the same time require Portugal to regain a complete bond market access on September 2013. The recent sale of bonds with a 3-year maturity, was the first bond sale of the Portuguese state since requesting the bailout in April 2011, and the first step slowly to open up its governmental bond market again. Recently the ECB announced they will be ready also, to begin additional support to Portugal, with some yield-lowering bond purchases ([[Outright Monetary Transactions|OMTs]]), when the country regained complete market access.&lt;ref name="October 2012 status"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_03/10/2012_464362 |title=Portugal seeks market access with $5 bln bond exchange |publisher=Kathimerini (English Edition) |date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=17 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005235156/http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_03/10/2012_464362 |archivedate=5 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All together this bodes well for a further decline of the governmental interest rates in Portugal, which on 30 January 2012 had a peak for the 10-year rate at 17.3% (after the rating agencies had cut the governments credit rating to "non-investment grade" -also referred to as "junk"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markets.ft.com/RESEARCH/markets/DataArchiveFetchReport?Category=BR&amp;Type=SPR&amp;Date=01/30/2012|title=Data archive for bonds and rates (Ten-year government bond spreads on 30 January 2012)|format=PDF|publisher=Financial Times|date=30 January 2012|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 24 November 2012 has been more than halved to only 7.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forexpros.com/rates-bonds/portugal-10-year-bond-yield-historical-data|title=Portugal 10-Year Futures Historical Data|publisher=ForexPros.com|date=24 November 2012|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rejection of Austerity Conditions and Political Crisis==
In the [[2015 Portuguese legislative election|parliamentary elections of October 2015]], the ruling right wing party failed to achieve an operating majority despite having won the elections by a solid margin. An anti-austerity post-electoral left wing coalition was formed achieving 51% of the vote and 53% of elected MPs, however, the President of Portugal at first refused to allow the left wing coalition to govern, inviting the minority right wing coalition to form a government. This was formed in November 2015 and lasted 11 days when it lost motion of confidence. The President eventually invited and asked the Socialist Party to form a government supported by 123 of 230 MPs in parliament from all parties except the former right wing coalition which broke into two parties. The new government (of the Socialist Party and independents) took office in November 2015 with a parliamentary majority thanks to the support of the Left Bloc, the Green Party and the Communist Party and the abstention of the Animal Welfare Party (PAN). 
In 2017, the IMF saw a 2.5 percent growth rate and an unemployment rate below 10 percent, but the European Commission expected Portugal's Government debt to reach 128.5 percent of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/02/how-portugal-came-back-from-the-brink.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key economic data in 2016==
* Budget deficit in 2016 was 2.1% of GDP, 0.4% the arbitrary limit set for it by the EC, the lowest since 1974, and less than half of the previous government's last year in power 2015. It is also 0.9% below the limits agreed at Maastricht.
* In 2016, Portuguese GDP was $259 billion, up by about 3% from 2015, and 21% from its record low in 2012.
* In 2016, Portugal registered a 14-year sequence of continuous increases in [[debt-to-GDP ratio]]s, i.e., since the adoption of the Euro as currency.
* In 2016, combined sovereign and personal debt in Portugal was the 5th largest in the Eurozone, reaching a combined 390% of GDP
* In April 2017, the unemployment rate was 9.5%, over 8% below the all-time high reached in 2013 though still slightly above the 43 year average since the country became a democracy.
