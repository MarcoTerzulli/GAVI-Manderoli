[[File:Pok_ta_pok_ballgame_maya_indians_mexico_3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The ball in front of the goal during a game of [[pok-ta-pok]].]]
The '''Mesoamerican ballgame'''&lt;!--Other names and translations should be put in the Name section below.--&gt; was a [[sport]] with ritual associations played since at least 1650 BCE&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey P. Blomster and Víctor E. Salazar Chávez. [https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/11/eaay6964 “Origins of the Mesoamerican ballgame: Earliest ballcourt from the highlands found at Etlatongo, Oaxaca, Mexico”], “[[Science Advances]]”, 13 March 2020. Retrieved 14 March 2020.&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[pre-Columbian]] people of [[Mesoamerica|Ancient Mesoamerica]]. The sport had different versions in different places during the millennia, and a newer more modern version of the game, ''[[Ulama (game)|ulama]]'', is still played in a few places by the [[Native Mexicans|indigenous population]].&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;Fox, John (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=LD6h3NHeHxgC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''The ball : discovering the object of the game"''], 1st ed., New York: Harper. {{ISBN|9780061881794}}. Cf. Chapter 4: "Sudden Death in the New World" about the Ulama game.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of the game are not known, but judging from its descendant, [[Ulama (game)|ulama]], they were probably similar to [[racquetball]],&lt;ref name="Schwartz-2008"&gt;{{cite news|ref=Schwartz|last1=Schwartz|first1=Jeremy|title=Indigenous groups keep ancient sports alive in Mexico|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/world/12/19/1219mexoldsports.html|accessdate=20 December 2008|work=Austin American-Statesman|date=19 December 2008}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the aim is to keep the ball in play.  The stone ballcourt goals are a late addition to the game.

In the most common theory of the game, the players struck the ball with their hips, although some versions allowed the use of forearms, rackets, bats, or handstones.  The ball was made of solid [[rubber]] and weighed as much as 4&amp;nbsp;kg (9&amp;nbsp;lbs), and sizes differed greatly over time or according to the version played.

The game had important [[ritual]] aspects, and major formal ballgames were held as ritual events. Late in the history of the game, some cultures occasionally seem to have combined competitions with religious [[human sacrifice]]. The sport was also played casually for recreation by children and may have been played by women as well.&lt;ref&gt;The primary evidence for female ballplayers is in the many apparently female figurines of the Formative period, wearing a ballplayer loincloth and perhaps other gear. In ''The Sport of Life and Death'', editor Michael Whittington says: "It would [therefore] seem reasonable that women also played the game—perhaps in all-female teams—or participated in some yet to be understood ceremony enacted on the ballcourt." (p. 186).  In the same volume, Gillett Griffin states that although these figurines have been "interpreted by some as females, in the context of ancient Mesoamerican society the question of the presence of female ballplayers, and their role in the game, is still debated." (p. 158).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Columbian [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]] have been found throughout Mesoamerica, as for example at [[Copán]], as far south as modern [[Nicaragua]], and possibly as far north as what is now the U.S. state of [[Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;The evidence for ballcourts among the [[Hohokam]] is not accepted by all researchers and even the proponents admit that the proposed Hohokam Ballcourts are significantly different from Mesoamerican ones: they are oblong, with a concave (not flat) surface.  See Wilcox's article and photo at end of this article.&lt;/ref&gt; These ballcourts vary considerably in size, but all have long narrow alleys with slanted side-walls against which the balls could bounce.

==Names==
The Mesoamerican ballgame is known by a wide variety of names. In English, it is often called ''pok-ta-pok'' (or ''pok-a-tok''). This term originates from a 1932 article by Danish archaeologist [[Frans Blom]], who adapted it from the [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]] word {{lang|yua|pokolpok}}.&lt;ref name="Dodson"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dodson |first1=Steve |title=POK-TA-POK |url=http://languagehat.com/pok-ta-pok/ |website=Languagehat |accessdate=20 April 2017 |date=8 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blom |first1=Frans |title=The Maya Ball-Game 'Pok-ta-pok', called Tlachtli by the Aztecs |journal=Middle American Research Series Publications |publisher=Tulane University |date=1932 |volume=4 |pages=485–530 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nahuatl]], the language of the Aztecs, it was called {{lang|nci|ōllamaliztli}} ({{IPA-nah|oːlːamaˈlistɬi|}}) or {{lang|nci|tlachtli}} ({{IPA-nah|ˈtɬatʃtɬi|}}). In [[Classical Maya]], it was known as {{lang|emy|pitz}}. In modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]], it is called {{lang|es|juego de pelota maya}} ('Maya ballgame'),&lt;ref name="MundoMaya"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graña Behrens |first1=Daniel |title=Mundo Maya |date=2001 |publisher=Cholsamaj |location=Guatemala |isbn=978-99922-56-41-1 |pages=203–228 |language=Spanish |chapter=El Juego de Pelota Maya }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|es|juego de pelota mesoamericano}} ('Mesoamerican ballgame'),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Espinoza |first=Mauricio |year=2002 |title=El Corazón del Juego: El Juego de Pelota Mesoamericano como Texto Cultural en la Narrativa y el Cine Contemporáneo |url=http://www.denison.edu/collaborations/istmo/n04/proyectos/corazon.html |journal=Istmo |volume=4 |issn=1535-2315 |language=es |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524065929/http://www.denison.edu/collaborations/istmo/n04/proyectos/corazon.html |archivedate=2007-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply {{lang|es|pelota maya}} ('Maya ball').

==Origins==
[[Image:Early Mesoamerican Ballgame sites 1.svg|thumb|350px|right|Map showing sites where early ballcourts, balls, or figurines have been recovered]]
It is not known precisely when or where ōllamaliztli originated, although it is likely that the game originated earlier than 1400 BCE in the low-lying tropical zones home to the [[Castilla elastica|rubber tree]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shelton|Shelton]], pp. 109–110. There is wide agreement on game originating in the tropical lowlands, likely the Gulf Coast or Pacific Coast.&lt;/ref&gt;

One candidate for the birthplace of the ballgame is the [[Soconusco]] coastal lowlands along the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Taladoire2001|Taladoire (2001)]] pp. 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, at [[Paso de la Amada]], archaeologists have found the oldest ballcourt yet discovered, dated to approximately 1400 BCE.&lt;ref name="See Hill 1998"/&gt;

[[File:Chichén_Itzá_-_Juego_de_Pelota.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A view of the Chichen Itza Ballgame (Yucatán, Mexico), from the pyramid "El Castillo.]]
The other major candidate is the [[Olmec heartland]], across the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] along the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico|Gulf Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Taube (1993, p.42)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aztecs]] referred to their [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] contemporaries who then inhabited the region as the ''Olmeca'' (i.e. "rubber people") since the region was strongly identified with [[latex]] production.&lt;ref&gt;These Gulf Coast inhabitants, the [[Olmeca-Xicalanca]], are not to be confused with the [[Olmec]], the name bestowed by 20th century archaeologists on the influential Gulf Coast civilization which had dominated that region three thousand years earlier.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest-known rubber balls come from the sacrificial bog at [[El Manatí]], an early Olmec-associated site located in the hinterland of the [[Coatzacoalcos River]] drainage system.  Villagers, and subsequently archaeologists, have recovered a dozen balls ranging in diameter from 10 to 22&amp;nbsp;cm from the freshwater spring there.  Five of these balls have been dated to the earliest-known occupational phase for the site, approximately 1700–1600 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ortiz1999|Ortiz and Rodríguez]] (1999), pp. 228–232, 242–243.&lt;/ref&gt;  These rubber balls were found with other ritual offerings buried at the site, indicating that even at this early date ōllamaliztli had religious and ritual connotations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diehl|Diehl]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Uriarte|Uriarte]], p. 41, who finds that the juxtaposition at El Manatí of the deposited balls and serpentine staffs (which may have been used to strike the balls) shows that there was already a "well-developed ideological relationship between the [ball]game, power, and serpents."&lt;/ref&gt;  A stone "yoke" of the type frequently associated with Mesoamerican ballcourts was also reported to have been found by local villagers at the site, leaving open the distinct possibility that these rubber balls were related to the ritual ballgame, and not simply an independent form of sacrificial [[votive deposit|offering]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ortiz1999|Ortiz and Rodríguez]] (1999), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ortíz, "Las ofrendas de El Manatí y su posible asociación con el juego de pelota: un yugo a destiempo", pp. 55–67 in [[#Uriarte|Uriarte]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La_Corona_Relieve_Juego_de_Pelota.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Relief of the Crown showing a scene from the Mesoamerican Ball Game.]]
Excavations at the nearby Olmec site of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] have also uncovered a number of ballplayer figurines, [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] as far back as 1250–1150 BCE.  A rudimentary ballcourt, dated to a later occupation at San Lorenzo, 600–400 BCE, has also been identified.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diehl|Diehl]], p. 32, although the identification of a ballcourt within San Lorenzo has not been universally accepted.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the tropical lowlands, ōllamaliztli apparently moved into central Mexico.  Starting around 1000 BCE or earlier, ballplayer figurines were interred with burials at [[Tlatilco]] and similarly styled figurines from the same period have been found at the nearby [[Tlapacoya (Mesoamerican site)|Tlapacoya]] site.&lt;ref name=BradleyJoralemon/&gt;  It was about this period, as well, that the so-called [[Xochipala]]-style ballplayer figurines were crafted in [[Guerrero]].  Although no ballcourts of similar age have been found in Tlatilco or Tlapacoya, it is possible that the ballgame was indeed played in these areas, but on courts with perishable boundaries or temporary court markers.&lt;ref name=Ekholm/&gt;

By 300 BCE, evidence for ōllamaliztli appears throughout much of the Mesoamerican archaeological record, including ballcourts in the Central Chiapas Valley (the next oldest ballcourts discovered, after Paso de la Amada),&lt;ref&gt;Finca Acapulco, San Mateo, and El Vergel, along the Grijalva, have ballcourts dated between 900 and 550 BCE (Agrinier, p. 175).&lt;/ref&gt;  and in the [[Oaxaca Valley]], as well as ceramic ballgame tableaus from Western Mexico (see photo below).

==Material and formal aspects==
[[File:Chichén_Itzá_Goal.jpg|thumb|left|250px]]

As might be expected with a game played over such a long period of time by many cultures, details varied over time and place, so the Mesoamerican ballgame might be more accurately seen as a family of related games.

In general, the hip-ball version is most popularly thought of as ''the'' Mesoamerican ballgame,&lt;ref name=orr/&gt; and researchers believe that this version was the primary—or perhaps only—version played within the [[masonry]] [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourt]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cohodas|Cohodas]], pp. 251–288&lt;/ref&gt; Ample archaeological evidence exists for games where the ball was struck by a wooden stick (e.g., a mural at Teotihuacan shows a game which resembles [[field hockey]]), racquets, bats and batons, handstones, and the forearm, perhaps at times in combination. Each of the various types of games had its own size of ball, specialized gear and playing field, and rules.

Games were played between two teams of players. The number of players per team could vary, between two to four.&lt;ref&gt;The 16th century Aztec chronicler [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia|Motolinia]] stated that the games were played by a two-man team vs. a two-man team, three-man team vs. a three-man team, and even a two-man team vs. a three-man team (quoted by [[#Shelton|Shelton]], p. 107).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, Brian M. ''The Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World'' reports that four-man vs four-man team also existed&lt;/ref&gt; Some games were played on makeshift courts for simple recreation while others were formal spectacles on huge stone ballcourts leading to human sacrifice.

[[File:Ulama 37 (Aguilar).jpg|right|thumb|upright|A modern [[Sinaloa]] [[Ulama (game)|ulama]] player. The outfit is similar to that worn by Aztec players.]]

Even without human sacrifice, the game could be brutal and there were often serious injuries inflicted by the solid, heavy ball. Today's hip-''[[Ulama (game)|ulama]]'' players are "perpetually bruised"&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080319010915/http://www.calstatela.edu/academic/anthro/jbrady/ulama/photo3ab.htm Cal State L.A.]&lt;/ref&gt;  while nearly 500 years ago Spanish chronicler [[Diego Durán]] reported that some bruises were so severe that they had to be lanced open. He also reported that players were even killed when the ball "hit them in the mouth or the stomach or the intestines".&lt;ref name=Blanchard/&gt;

The rules of ōllamaliztli, regardless of the version, are not known in any detail. In modern-day ''[[ulama (game)|ulama]]'', the game resembles a netless [[volleyball]],&lt;ref name=Noble/&gt; with each team confined to one half of the court. In the most widespread version of ''ulama'', the ball is hit back and forth using only the hips until one team fails to return it or the ball leaves the court.

In the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]] period, the Maya began placing vertical stone rings on each side of the court, the object being to pass the ball through one, an innovation that continued into the later [[Toltec]] and [[Aztec]] cultures.

In the 16th-century Aztec ballgame that the Spaniards witnessed, points were lost by a player who let the ball bounce more than twice before returning it to the other team, who let the ball go outside the boundaries of the court, or who tried and failed to pass the ball through one of the stone rings placed on each wall along the center line.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Day|Day]], p. 66, who further references [[Diego Durán]] and [[Bernardino de Sahagún]].&lt;/ref&gt;  According to 16th-century Aztec chronicler [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia|Motolinia]], points were gained if the ball hit the opposite end wall, while the decisive victory was reserved for the team that put the ball through a ring.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shelton|Shelton]], pp. 107–108, who quotes Motolinia.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, placing the ball through the ring was a rare event—the rings at Chichen Itza, for example, were set six meters off the playing field—and most games were likely won on points.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

===Clothing and gear===
[[File: Palmas_(Mesoamerican_ballgame)_2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Two palmas from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. These palmas were equipment used in the Mesoamerican ballgame and come from Veracruz, Mexico, ca. 700 - 1000 CE/AD. They are approximately 1½ feet (50 cm) high.]]
The game's paraphernalia—clothing, headdresses, gloves, all but the stone—are long gone, so knowledge on clothing relies on art—paintings and drawings, stone reliefs, and figurines—to provide evidence for pre-Columbian ballplayer clothing and gear, which varied considerably in type and quantity. Capes and masks, for example, are shown on several [[Dainzú]] [[relief]]s, while Teotihuacan murals show men playing stick-ball in skirts.&lt;ref name=t2004 /&gt;

[[File:Pelotaspieler_2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[National Museum of Anthropology]] in Mexico City. A figure of a pelota player.]]
The basic hip-game outfit consisted of a [[loincloth]], sometimes augmented with leather hip guards. Loincloths are found on the earliest ballplayer figurines from Tlatilco, Tlapacoya, and the Olmec culture, are seen in the Weiditz drawing from 1528 (below), and, with hip guards, are the sole outfit of modern-day ''[[ulama (game)|ulama]]'' players (above)—a span of nearly 3,000 years.

In many cultures, further protection was provided by a thick [[girdle]], most likely of wicker or wood covered in fabric or leather.  Made of perishable materials, none of these girdles have survived, although many stone "yokes" have been uncovered. Misnamed by earlier archaeologists due to its resemblance to an [[yoke|animal yoke]], the stone yoke is thought to be too heavy for actual play and was likely used only before or after the game in ritual contexts.&lt;ref name=Scott /&gt; In addition to providing some protection from the ball, the girdle or yoke would also have helped propel the ball with more force than the hip alone.  Additionally, some players wore chest protectors called ''palmas'' which were inserted into the yoke and stood upright in front of the chest.

Kneepads are seen on a variety of players from many areas and eras and are worn by forearm-''ulama'' players today. A type of [[Garter (stockings)|garter]] is also often seen, worn just below the knee or around the ankle—it is not known what function this served. Gloves appear on the purported ballplayer [[relief]]s of Dainzú, roughly 500 BCE, as well as the Aztec players are drawn by Weiditz 2,000 years later (see drawing below).&lt;ref&gt;Dainzu gloves are discussed in [[#Taladoire2004|Taladoire, 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Blanchard /&gt; Helmets (likely utilitarian) and elaborate headdresses (likely used only in ritual contexts) are also common in ballplayer depictions, headdresses being particularly prevalent on Maya painted vases or on [[Jaina Island]] figurines. Many ballplayers of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic era]] are seen with a right kneepad—no left—and a wrapped right forearm, as shown in the Maya image above.

=== Rubber balls ===
[[Image:Xiuhtecuhtli, Codex Borgia, 14, w rubber balls offering.jpg|right|thumb|In this detail from the late 15th century [[Codex Borgia]], the Aztec god [[Xiuhtecuhtli]] brings a rubber ball offering to a temple. The balls each hold a [[quetzal]] feather, part of the offering.]]
{{Main|Mesoamerican rubber balls}}
The sizes or weights of the balls actually used in the ballgame are not known with any certainty. While several dozen ancient balls have been recovered, they were originally laid down as offerings in a sacrificial bog or spring, and there is no evidence that any of these were used in the ballgame.  In fact, some of these extant [[Votive deposit|votive balls]] were created specifically ''as'' offerings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#FilloyNadal|Filloy Nadal]], p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, based on a review of modern-day game balls, ancient rubber balls, and other archaeological evidence, it is presumed by most researchers that the ancient hip-ball was made of a mix from one or another of the latex-producing plants found all the way from the southeastern rain forests to the northern desert.&lt;ref&gt;[[#FilloyNadal|Filloy Nadal]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most balls were made from latex sap of the lowland ''[[Castilla elastica]]'' tree. Someone discovered that by mixing latex with sap from the vine of a species of morning glory (''[[Calonyction aculeatum]]'') they could turn the slippery polymers in raw latex into a resilient rubber. The size varied between {{convert|10|and|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} (measured in hand spans) and weighed {{convert|3|to|6|lb|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schwartz|Schwartz]] states that the ball used by present-day players is {{convert|8|lb}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ball used in the ancient handball or stick-ball game was probably slightly larger and heavier than a modern-day baseball.&lt;ref&gt;[[#FilloyNadal|Filloy Nadal]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leyenaar/&gt;

Some Maya depictions, such as the painting above or [[:Image:Staircase Riser, Maya, ballgame.jpg|this relief]], show balls {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}} or more in diameter. Academic consensus is that these depictions are exaggerations or symbolic, as are, for example, the impossibly unwieldy headdresses worn in the same portrayals.&lt;ref name=Coe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cohodas|Cohodas]], p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ballcourt ===
{{Main|Mesoamerican ballcourt}}
[[File:Uaxactunballcourt.jpg|thumb|left|Ballcourt at [[Uaxactun]], in the [[Petén Basin]] region of the Maya lowlands]]
[[File:Juego de pelota.jpg|thumb|Classic [[File:I, heavily serifed.png|10px]]-shape ball court in [[Cihuatan]] site, [[El Salvador]]]]
[[File:Phoenix-Pueblo Grande Ruin-Hohokam Village.JPG|thumb|[[Pueblo Grande Ruin and Irrigation Sites]] in Phoenix, with mounds like ballcourts]]

Ōllamaliztli was played within a large [[masonry]] structure. Built in a form that changed remarkably little during 2,700 years, over 1,300 Mesoamerican ballcourts have been identified, 60% in the last 20 years alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Taladoire2001|Taladoire (2001)]] p. 98.  Note that there are slightly over 200 ballcourts also identified in the [[American Southwest]] which are ''not'' included in this total, since these are outside Mesoamerica and there is significant discussion whether these areas were used for ballplaying or not.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is a tremendous variation in size, in general all ballcourts have the same shape: a long narrow playing alley flanked by walls with both horizontal and sloping (or, more rarely, vertical) surfaces.  The walls were often plastered and brightly painted. Although the alleys in early ballcourts were open-ended, later ballcourts had enclosed end-zones, giving the structure an [[File:I, heavily serifed.png|10px]]-shape when viewed from above.
Although the length-to-width ratio remained relatively constant at 4-to-1,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Quirarte|Quirarte]], pp. 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt; there was nonetheless tremendous variation in ballcourt size.  The playing field of the Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza, by far the largest, measures 96.5 meters long by 30 meters wide, while the Ceremonial Court at [[Tikal]] was only 16 meters by 5 meters.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Taladoire2001|Taladoire (2001)]] p. 100. Note that Taladoire is measuring the "playing field", while other authors include the benches and other trappings. See [[#Quirarte|Quirarte]], pp. 205–208. It is thought that neither the Great Ballcourt nor Tikal's Ceremonial Court were used for ballgames (Scarborough, p. 137).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mesoamerican Ballcourt cross-sections 3.svg|thumb|right|Cross sections of some of the more typical ballcourts]]
Across Mesoamerica, ballcourts were built and used for many generations. Although ballcourts are found within most sizable Mesoamerican ruins, they are not equally distributed across time or geography. For example, the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic]] site of [[El Tajín]], the largest city of the ballgame-obsessed [[Classic Veracruz culture]], has at least 18 ballcourts, while [[Cantona (archaeological site)|Cantona]], a nearby contemporaneous site, sets the record with 24.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Day|Day]], p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, northern [[Chiapas]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#TaladoireColsenet|Taladoire and Colsenet]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the northern Maya Lowlands&lt;ref name=Kurjack /&gt; have relatively few, and ballcourts are conspicuously absent at some major sites, including [[Teotihuacan]], [[Bonampak]], and [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]], although ōllamaliztli iconography has been found there.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Taladoire2001|Taladoire (2001)]] p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient cities with particularly fine ballcourts in good condition include [[Tikal]], [[Yaxha]], [[Copán]], [[Coba]], [[Iximche]], [[Monte Albán]], [[Uxmal]], [[Chichen Itza]], [[Yagul]], [[Xochicalco]], [[Mixco Viejo]], and [[Zaculeu]].

Ballcourts were public spaces used for a variety of elite cultural events and ritual activities like musical performances and festivals, and, of course, the ballgame.  Pictorial depictions often show musicians playing at ballgames, while [[votive deposit]]s buried at the Main Ballcourt at [[Tenochtitlan]] contained miniature whistles, [[ocarina]]s, and [[Teponaztli|drums]].   A pre-Columbian ceramic from western Mexico shows what appears to be a wrestling match taking place on a ballcourt.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Day|Day]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural aspects==

===Proxy for warfare===
[[File:El Baúl Ballgame Stela.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Stela from [[El Baúl]] in the [[Cotzumalhuapa]] Nuclear Zone, showing two ballplayers.]]

Ōllamaliztli was a ritual deeply ingrained in Mesoamerican cultures and served purposes beyond that of a mere sporting event.  [[Fray Juan de Torquemada]], a 16th-century Spanish missionary and historian, tells that the Aztec emperor [[Axayacatl]] played [[Xihuitlemoc]], the leader of [[Xochimilco#Precolonial|Xochimilco]], wagering his annual income against several Xochimilco [[chinampas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Taladoire2001|Taladoire (2001)]] p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxochitl|Ixtlilxochitl]], a contemporary of Torquemada, relates that [[Ce Acatl Topiltzin|Topiltzin]], the [[Toltec]] king, played against three rivals, with the winner ruling over the losers.&lt;ref name=s14&gt;[[#Santley|Santley]], pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

These examples and others are cited by many researchers who have made compelling arguments that ōllamaliztli served as a way to defuse or resolve conflicts without genuine warfare, to settle disputes through a ballgame instead of a battle.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TaladoireColsenet|Taladoire and Colsenet]], p. 174: "We suggest that the ballgame was used as a substitute and a symbol for war."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gillespie|Gillespie]], p. 340: the ballgame was "a boundary maintenance mechanism between polities".&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time, then, the ballgame's role would expand to include not only external mediation, but also the resolution of competition and conflict within the society as well.&lt;ref name=Kowalewski/&gt;

This "boundary maintenance" or "conflict resolution" theory would also account for some of the irregular distribution of ballcourts.  Overall, there appears to be a negative correlation between the degree of political centralization and the number of ballcourts at a site.&lt;ref name=s14/&gt;  For example, the [[Aztec]] Empire, with a strong centralized [[Sovereign state|state]] and few external rivals, had relatively few ballcourts while [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Classic]] [[Cantona (Mesoamerican site)|Cantona]], with 24 ballcourts, had many diverse cultures residing there under a relatively weak state.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Day|Day]], p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Taladoire2001|Taladoire (2001)]] p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars support these arguments by pointing to the warfare imagery often found at ballcourts:

*The southeast panel of the South Ballcourt at El Tajín shows the protagonist ballplayer being dressed in a warrior's garb.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilkerson|Wilkerson]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Captives are a prominent part of ballgame iconography.  For example:
:::Several ceramic figurines show war captives holding game balls.
:::The ballcourt at [[Toniná]] was decorated with sculptures of bound captives.
:::A captive-within-the-ball motif is seen on the Hieroglyphic Stairs at Structure 33 in [[Yaxchilan]] and on Altar 8 at [[Tikal]].
*The modern-day descendant of the ballgame, ''ulama'', "until quite recently was connected with warfare and many reminders of that association remain".&lt;ref&gt;[[California State University, Los Angeles]], Department of Anthropology, [http://www.calstatela.edu/academic/anthro/jbrady/ulama/photohi.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human sacrifice===
[[File:Panel9SBCTajin.JPG|thumb|left|One of a series of murals from the South Ballcourt at El Tajín, showing the sacrifice of a ballplayer]]
The association between human sacrifice and the ballgame appears rather late in the archaeological record, no earlier than the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic era]].&lt;ref&gt;Kubler, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; The association was particularly strong within the [[Classic Veracruz culture|Classic Veracruz]] and the Maya cultures, where the most explicit depictions of human sacrifice can be seen on the ballcourt panels—for example at El Tajín (850–1100 CE)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Uriarte|Uriarte]], p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; and at Chichen Itza (900–1200 CE)—as well as on the [[:Image:Jugador de pelota decapitado. Museo de Jalapa. México.jpg|decapitated ballplayer stelae]] from the Classic Veracruz site of Aparicio (700–900 CE).  The Postclassic Maya religious and quasi-historical narrative, the [[Popol Vuh]], also links human sacrifice with the ballgame (see below).

Captives were often shown in [[Ancient Maya art|Maya art]], and it is assumed that these captives were sacrificed after losing a rigged ritual ballgame.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schele|Schele and Miller]], p. 249: "It would not be surprising if the game were rigged"&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than nearly nude and sometimes battered captives, however, the ballcourts at El Tajín and Chichen Itza show the sacrifice of practiced ballplayers, perhaps the captain of a team.&lt;ref name=c255&gt;[[#Cohodas|Cohodas]], p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gillespie|Gillespie]], p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; Decapitation is particularly associated with the ballgame—severed heads are featured in much Late Classic ballgame art and appear repeatedly in the [[Popol Vuh]]. There has been speculation that the heads and skulls were used as balls.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schele|Schele and Miller]], p. 243: "occasionally [sacrificial victims'] decapitated heads (sic) were placed in play"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbolism===
Little is known about the game's symbolic contents. Several themes recur in scholarly writing.

[[File:Juego_de_Pelota_Teuchitlán.JPG|thumb|right|250px|This is a photo of a monument in Mexico]]

*Astronomy. The [[bouncing ball]] is thought to have represented the sun.&lt;ref&gt;The ball-as-sun analogy is common in ballgame literature; see, among others, [[#Gillespie|Gillespie]], or Blanchard. Some researchers contend that the ball represents not the sun, but the moon.&lt;/ref&gt; The stone scoring rings are speculated to signify sunrise and sunset, or equinoxes.
*War. This is the most obvious symbolic aspect of the game (see also above, "Proxy for warfare"). Among the Mayas, the ball can represent the vanquished enemy, both in the late-Postclassic K'iche' kingdom (Popol Vuh), and in Classic kingdoms such as that of Yaxchilan.
*Fertility. Formative period ballplayer figurines—most likely females—often wear [[maize]] icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bradley, Douglas E. |year=1997 |title=Life, Death and Duality: A Handbook of the Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, C.S.C. Collection of Ritual Ballgame Sculpture |series=Snite Museum of Art Bulletin, Vol. 1 |location=Notre Dame, IN|publisher=University of Notre Dame |oclc=39750624}}. Bradley finds that a raised circular dot, or a U-shaped symbol with a dot in the middle, or raised U- or V-shaped areas each represent maize.&lt;/ref&gt;  At El Tajín, the ballplayer sacrifice ensures the renewal of [[pulque]], an alcoholic [[Agave americana|maguey]] [[cactus]] beverage.
*Cosmologic duality. The game is seen as a struggle between day and night,&lt;ref name=c255/&gt; and/or a battle between life and the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;[[#TaladoireColsenet|Taladoire and Colsenet]], p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Courts were considered portals to the underworld and were built in key locations within the central ceremonial precincts. Playing ball engaged one in the maintenance of the cosmic order of the universe and the ritual regeneration of life.

===Myth===

====Nahua====
According to an important [[Nahuan languages|Nahua]] source, the Leyenda de los Soles,&lt;ref name=Velazquez/&gt; the Toltec king Huemac played ball against the [[Tlaloc]]s, with precious stones and quetzal feathers at stake. Huemac won the game. When instead of precious stones and feathers, the rain deities offered Huemac their young maize ears and maize leaves, Huemac refused. As a consequence of this vanity, the Toltecs suffered a four-year drought. The same ball game match, with its unfortunate aftermath, signified the beginning of the end of the Toltec reign.

====Maya====
[[File:Pelotaspieler 1.jpg|left|thumb|Ballcourt marker, from the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Chinkultic]], dated to 591.  The ball itself displays the finely incised portrait of a young deity.]]
The [[Maya Hero Twins|Maya Twin myth]] of the [[Popol Vuh]] establishes the importance of the game (referred to in Classic Maya as ''pitz'') as a symbol for warfare intimately connected to the themes of fertility and death. The story begins with the Hero Twins' father, [[Hun Hunahpu]], and uncle, Vucub Hunahpu, playing ball near the underworld, [[Xibalba]].&lt;ref&gt;These excerpts from the Popol Vuh can be found in Christenson's recent translation or in any work on the Popol Vuh.&lt;/ref&gt;  The lords of the underworld became annoyed with the noise from the ball playing and so the primary lords of Xibalba, One Death and Seven Death, sent owls to lure the brothers to the ballcourt of Xibalba, situated on the western edge of the underworld. Despite the danger the brothers fall asleep and are captured and sacrificed by the lords of Xibalba and then buried in the ballcourt. Hun Hunahpu is decapitated and his head hung in a fruit tree, which bears the first [[calabash]] [[gourd]]s. Hun Hunahpu's head spits into the hands of a passing goddess who conceives and bears the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque. The Hero Twins eventually find the ballgame equipment in their father’s house and start playing, again to the annoyance of the Lords of Xibalba, who summon the twins to play the ballgame amidst trials and dangers. In one notable episode, Hunahpu is decapitated by bats. His brother uses a squash as Hunahpu's substitute head until his real one, now used as a ball by the Lords, can be retrieved and placed back on Hunahpu's shoulders. The twins eventually go on to play the ballgame with the Lords of Xibalba, defeating them. However, the twins are unsuccessful in reviving their father, so they leave him buried in the ball court of Xibalba.

==The ballgame in Mesoamerican civilizations==

=== Maya civilization ===
[[File:GreatBallCourt-interior.jpg|thumb|400px|Great Ballcourt at [[Chichen Itza]]]]

In Maya Ballgame the [[Maya Hero Twins|Hero Twins]] myth links ballcourts with death and its overcoming. The ballcourt becomes a place of transition, a liminal stage between life and death. The ballcourt markers along the centerline of the Classic playing field depicted ritual and mythical scenes of the ballgame, often bordered by a [[quatrefoil]] that marked a portal into another world. The Twins themselves, however, are usually absent from Classic ballgame scenes, with the [[Vucub Caquix]] of the [[Copán]] ball court babe, holding the severed arm of Hunahpu, as an important exception.&lt;ref name=CM/&gt;

===Teotihuacan===
No ballcourt has yet been identified at [[Teotihuacan]], making it by far the largest Classic era site without one.  In fact, the ballgame seems to have been nearly forsaken not only in Teotihuacan, but in areas such as [[Matacapan]] or [[Tikal]] that were under Teotihuacano influence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Taladoire2001|Taladoire (2001)]] p. 109, who states that Matacapan and Tikal did indeed build ballcourts but only after the fall of Teotihuacan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the lack of a ballcourt, ball games were not unknown there.  The murals of the [[Tepantitla]] compound at Teotihuacan show a number of small scenes that seem to portray various types of ball games, including:
*A two-player game in an open-ended masonry ballcourt.&lt;ref name="Taladoire 2001 p. 112"&gt;[[#Taladoire2001|Taladoire (2001)]] p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; (See third picture below.)
*Teams using sticks on an open field whose end zones are marked by stone monuments.&lt;ref name="Taladoire 2001 p. 112"/&gt;
*Separate renditions of single players. (See side pictures above.)

It has been hypothesized that, for reasons as yet unknown, the stick-game eclipsed the hip-ball game at Teotihuacan and at Teotihuacan-influenced cities, and only after the fall of Teotihuacan did the hip-game reassert itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Taladoire2001|Taladoire (2001)]] p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Aztec===
[[File:Codex-borgia-tlachtli.png|right|thumb|An I-shaped ballcourt with players and balls depicted in the [[Codex Borgia]] Folio 45.  Note that the four players are all holding batons, perhaps indicating that they are playing a type of racquet- or stick-ball.]]
The Aztec version of the ballgame is called ''ōllamalitzli'' (sometimes spelled ''ullamaliztli'')&lt;ref&gt;The Nahuatl word for the game, ''ōllamaliztli'' ({{IPA-nah|oːllamaˈlistɬi|}}) was often spelled ''ullamaliztli''—the orthography with "u" is a misrendering of the Náhuatl word caused by the fact that the quality of the nahuatl vowel /ō/ sounds a little like Spanish /u/.&lt;/ref&gt; and are derived from the word ''ōlli'' "rubber" and the verb ''ōllama'' or "to play ball".  The ball itself was called ''ōllamaloni'' and the ballcourt was called a ''tlachtli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈtɬatʃtɬi|}}.&lt;ref&gt;The name of the present day city of [[Taxco]], [[Guerrero]], comes from the Nahuatl word ''tlachcho'' meaning "in the ballcourt".&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aztec capital [[Tenochtitlan]] the largest ballcourt was called ''Teotlachco'' ("in the holy ballcourt")—here several important rituals would take place on the festivals of the month [[Panquetzalitzli]], including the [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|sacrifice]] of four war captives to the honor of [[Huitzilopochtli]] and his herald [[PaInal]].

For the Aztecs the playing of the ballgame also had religious significance, but where the 16th-century K´iche´ Maya saw the game as a battle between the lords of the underworld and their earthly adversaries, their Aztec contemporaries may have seen it as a battle of the sun, personified by [[Huitzilopochtli]], against the forces of night, led by the moon and the stars, and represented by the goddess [[Coyolxauhqui]] and [[Coatlicue]]'s sons the [[Centzonuitznaua|400 Huitznahuah]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Garza|De La Garza &amp; Izquierdo]], p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; But apart from holding important ritual and mythical meaning, the ballgame for the Aztecs was a sport and a pastime played for fun, although in general the Aztec game was a prerogative of the nobles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilkerson|Wilkerson]], p. 45 and others, although there is by no means a universal view; [[#Santley|Santley]], p. 8: "The game was played by nearly all adolescent and adult males, noble and commoner alike."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Weiditz Trachtenbuch 010-011.jpg|left|thumb|220x220px|Aztec ullamaliztli players performing for Charles V in Spain, drawn by Christoph Weiditz in 1528.]]
Young Aztecs would be taught ballplaying in the [[calmecac]] school—and those who were most proficient might become so famous that they could play professionally. Games would frequently be staged in the different city wards and markets—often accompanied by large-scale betting. [[Diego Durán]], an early Spanish chronicler, said that "these wretches...  sold their children in order to bet and even staked themselves and became slaves".&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia|Motolinia]], another early Spanish chronicler, also mentioned the heavy betting that accompanied games in {{cite book |author=Motolinia, Toribio de Benavente |authorlink=Motolinia|year=1903 |title=Memoriales|url=https://archive.org/details/memorialesdefra01sngoog |location=Paris|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the rubber tree ''[[Castilla elastica]]'' was not found in the highlands of the Aztec Empire, the Aztecs generally received balls and rubber as tribute from the lowland areas where it was grown. The ''[[Codex Mendoza]]'' gives a figure of 16,000 lumps of raw rubber being imported to Tenochtitlan from the southern provinces every six months, although not all of it was used for making balls.

In 1528, soon after the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|Spanish conquest]], [[Hernán Cortés|Cortés]] sent a troupe of ''ōllamanime'' (ballplayers) to Spain to perform for [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] where they were drawn by the German Christoph Weiditz.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Garza|De La Garza &amp; Izquierdo]], p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides the fascination with their exotic visitors, the Europeans were amazed by the bouncing rubber balls.

===Pacific coast===
[[File:Pok_ta_pok_ballgame_maya_indians_mexico_4.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pok-ta-pok player in action]]
Ballcourts, monuments with ballgame imagery and ballgame paraphernalia have been excavated at sites along the Pacific coast of Guatemala and El Salvador including the [[Cotzumalhuapa]] nuclear zone sites of [[Bilbao (Mesoamerican site)|Bilbao]] and [[El Baúl]] and sites right at the southeast periphery of the Mesoamerican region such as [[Quelepa]].&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrews/&gt;

Batey, a ball game played on many Caribbean islands including [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[West Indies]], has been proposed as a descendant of the Mesoamerican ballgame, perhaps through the Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alegría, Ricardo E. |year=1951 |title=The Ball Game Played by the Aborigines of the Antilles|journal=[[American Antiquity]]|location=Menasha, WI |publisher=Society for American Archaeology|volume=16|issue=4 |pages=348–352 |doi=10.2307/276984 |oclc=27201871 |jstor=276984}}&lt;/ref&gt;
