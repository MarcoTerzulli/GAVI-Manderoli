== History ==
Microsoft first announced Surface at an event on June 18, 2012, presented by former [[CEO]] [[Steve Ballmer]] in Milk Studios [[Los Angeles]]. Surface was the first major initiative by Microsoft to integrate its [[Windows 8|Windows]] operating system with its own hardware, and is the first PC designed and distributed solely by Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sullivan |first=Mark |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/257840/microsoft_announces_new_surface_tablet_pc.html |title=Microsoft Announces New 'Surface' Tablet PC |work=[[PC World]] |publisher=[[IDG]] |accessdate=June 19, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ETRMnQ6d |archivedate=February 16, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Surface device in the Surface line, was marketed as "Surface for Windows RT" at the time was and was announced by [[Steven Sinofsky]], former President of Windows and Windows Live. The second Surface line, based on the Intel architecture was spearheaded with Surface Pro, marketed as "Surface for Windows 8 Pro" at the time, and was demoed by Michael Angiulo, a corporate VP.

Sinofsky initially stated that pricing for the first Surface would be comparable to other ARM devices and pricing for Surface Pro would be comparable to current [[ultrabook]]s. Later, Ballmer noted the "sweet spot" for the bulk of the PC market was $300 to $800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2019168601_microsoftballmer16.html|title=Ballmer trumpets Microsoft's 'epic year'|last=Tu|first=Janet I|publisher=The Seattle Times|accessdate=September 19, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918144433/http://seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2019168601_microsoftballmer16.html|archivedate=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft revealed the pricing and began accepting preorders for the 2012 Surface tablet, on October 16, 2012  "for delivery by 10/26".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winsupersite.com/article/windows8/microsoft-surface-pricing-availability-144526|title=Microsoft Surface: Pricing and Availability|publisher=Paul Thurrott at winsupersite.com|accessdate=October 16, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018180110/http://www.winsupersite.com/article/windows8/microsoft-surface-pricing-availability-144526|archivedate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2012/10/16/microsoft-surface-windows-rt-device-now-available-to-pre-order/|title=Microsoft Surface Windows RT device Now available to pre order|work=Microsoft UK Faculty Connection|access-date=May 24, 2017|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021215705/https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2012/10/16/microsoft-surface-windows-rt-device-now-available-to-pre-order/|archivedate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/microsoft-surface-preorders-open-499-for-32gb-599-inc-touch-cover-16252030/|title=Microsoft Surface Preorders Open|publisher=slashgear.com|accessdate=October 16, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018061336/http://www.slashgear.com/microsoft-surface-preorders-open-499-for-32gb-599-inc-touch-cover-16252030/|archivedate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was launched alongside the [[general availability release|general availability]] of [[Windows 8]] on October 26, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://notebookbee.com/184/microsoft-launch-windows-8-surface-rt-tablet-october-25-midnight|title=Microsoft to launch Surface at midnight on October 26th|work=NotebookBee.com|date=October 5, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606011441/http://notebookbee.com/184/microsoft-launch-windows-8-surface-rt-tablet-october-25-midnight/|archivedate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface Pro became available the following year on February 9, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Panay|first=Panos|title=Growing the Surface Family: Surface Windows 8 Pro Availability Confirmed|url=http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2013/01/22/growing-the-surface-family-surface-windows-8-pro-availability-confirmed.aspx|work=The Official Microsoft Blog|publisher=Microsoft|date=January 22, 2013|editor-first=Jeffrey|editor-last=Meisner|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FANBzfNb|archivedate=March 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The devices were initially available only at [[Microsoft Store]]s retail and online, but availability was later expanded into other vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=Microsoft |work=News Center |url=http://news.microsoft.com/2012/06/18/microsoft-announces-surface-new-family-of-pcs-for-windows/ |title=Microsoft Announces Surface: New Family of PCs for Windows |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=June 20, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150108043058/http://news.microsoft.com/2012/06/18/microsoft-announces-surface-new-family-of-pcs-for-windows/ |archivedate=January 8, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 23, 2013, Microsoft announced the [[Surface 2]] and [[Surface Pro 2]], which feature hardware and software updates from the original. The Surface 2 launched October 22, 2013, alongside the Surface Pro 2, four days after the general availability of [[Windows 8.1]]. Later, Microsoft launched a variation of the Surface 2 with [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] connectivity for the [[AT&amp;T]] network on March 18, 2014. Microsoft then announced the redesigned [[Surface Pro 3]] on May 20, 2014, which went on sale on June 20, 2014.

The following year, on March 30, 2015, it announced the [[Surface 3]], a more compact version of the Surface Pro 3. On September 8, 2015, Microsoft announced the "Surface Enterprise Initiative", a partnership between [[Accenture]], [[Avanade]], [[Dell Inc.]], and [[HP Inc.|HP]], to "enable more customers to enjoy the benefits of Windows 10." As part of the partnership, Dell will resell Surface Pro products through its business and enterprise channels, and offer its existing enterprise services (including Pro Support, warranty, and Configuration and Deployment) for Surface Pro devices it sells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dell to start selling Microsoft's Surface Pro in new enterprise push|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/09/dell-to-start-selling-microsofts-surface-pro-in-new-enterprise-push/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=September 8, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909050820/http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/09/dell-to-start-selling-microsofts-surface-pro-in-new-enterprise-push/|archivedate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dell, HP to resell Microsoft's Surface Pro tablets|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/dell-hp-to-resell-microsofts-surface-pro-tablets/|website=ZDNet|accessdate=September 8, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908220759/http://www.zdnet.com/article/dell-hp-to-resell-microsofts-surface-pro-tablets/|archivedate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately following the announcement of the Surface Laptop at the #MicrosoftEDU event on May 2, 2017, and the Microsoft [[Build 2017]] developer conference, Microsoft announced the fifth-generation Surface Pro at a special event in Shanghai on May 23, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40011777|title=Microsoft launches new Surface Pro|date=May 23, 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=May 23, 2017|language=en-GB|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524104206/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40011777|archivedate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2017, Microsoft announced Surface Book 2 adding a 15 in model to the line, and updating internal components.

On May 15, 2018, Microsoft announced the Surface Hub 2, featuring a new rotating hinge and the ability to link multiple Hubs together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2018/05/15/meet-surface-hub-2 |title=Meet Surface Hub 2 |last=Panay |first=Panos |date=May 15, 2018 |work=Windows Blogs |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-surface-hub-2 |title=Microsoft's Surface Hub 2 sports a 4K+ display and gravity-defying hinge |last=Rubino |first=Daniel |date=May 15, 2018 |work=Windows Central |publisher=Mobile Nations |accessdate=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Microsoft announced the [[Surface Go]], a $400 Surface tablet with a 10-inch screen and 64 or 128&amp;nbsp;GB of storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chacos |first=Brad |date=May 16, 2018 |title=Microsoft may release a tiny $400 Surface tablet to challenge the iPad |publisher=[[PCWorld]] |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3273569/computers/microsoft-400-surface-tablet-rumors.html |accessdate=May 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October the 2nd 2019, Microsoft announced the Surface Pro 7, Surface Laptop 3 and the Surface Pro X to all be released that month. The Surface Pro 7 does away with the USB-A port along with specification upgrades and the Surface Laptop 3 also comes in with specification upgrades and a new 15 inch model, and a variant of the 15 inch model that runs on AMD. The Surface Pro X is Microsoft's attempt to try to have a Surface device that runs again on Windows, which runs on a chip designed in cooperation with Qualcomm called the Microsoft SQ1. It has the same form factor as the Surface Pro 7, but the bezels have been reduced and the device is slightly thinner. As all ARM Windows devices do, the Surface Pro X supports a sim card or an e-sim to allow customers to be always connected. As of the release of the Surface Pro X there is a translation layer which enables x86 32bit applications to run on the device, and it can run native ARM applications, but does not support x86 64 bit applications, however this is in the works.

On October the 2nd 2019 Microsoft also gave a few teasers for products that they are working on, the Surface Neo, which is a dual screen Microsoft tablet that looks to be running Windows 10X and also announced the Microsoft Surface Duo, which is a dual screen mobile phone that runs android. These devices will be released in 2020.

{{hatnote|Unless otherwise indicated, this section concerns the Surface series (including the Surface Go) and the Surface Pro series}}

=== Screen and input ===
The first two generations of both Surface lines features 10.6 [[ClearType]] [[Full HD]] display with 16:9 [[Display aspect ratio|aspect ratio]]. With the release of the third generation Surface and Surface Pro, Microsoft increased the screen sizes to {{convert|10.8|in|cm}} and {{convert|12|in|cm}} respectively, each with a 3:2 aspect ratio, designed for a comfort use in a [[page orientation|portrait orientation]]. The fourth generation increased the screen further to {{convert|12.3|in|cm}}. The screens feature a [[multi-touch]] technology with 10 touch-points and scratch-resistance [[Gorilla Glass]]. All generations of the Surface Pro and third generation of the Surface also features an [[active pen]], but it is not included in the box with all models.

The display responds to other sensors: an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3-axis [[accelerometer]] to sense Surface orientation and switch between portrait and landscape orientation modes. The Surface's built-in applications support screen rotation in all four directions, including upside-down.

There are three buttons on the first three generation of Surface, including a capacitive [[Windows key|Windows button]] near the display that opens the [[Start screen (Windows)|Start Screen]], and two physical buttons on the sides: power and volume. The fourth generation removed the capacitive windows button on the screen.

All Surfaces and Surface Pros have front and rear cameras as well as microphones.

=== Processor ===
The first generation Surface uses a [[quad-core]] [[Nvidia]] [[Tegra 3]] of the [[ARM architecture]], as opposed to the [[x86-64|Intel x64 architecture]] and therefore shipped with Windows RT, which was written for the ARM architecture. The second generation Surface 2 added an [[Nvidia Tegra 4]]. The architecture limited Surface and Surface 2 to only apps from the [[Windows Store]] recompiled for ARM. With the release of the Surface 3, Microsoft switched the Surface line to the Intel x64 architecture, the same architecture found in the Surface Pro line. Surface 3 uses the [[Silvermont|Braswell]] Atom X7 processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Surface 3|url = https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/products/surface-3|website = Microsoft Surface|accessdate = June 28, 2015|first = Microsoft|last = Surface|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150627174555/http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/products/surface-3|archivedate = June 27, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the Surface Pro line, Microsoft uses the Intel x64 architecture which can run most software designed for Microsoft Windows. Both Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 had one processor variant, the Core i5, though the Surface Pro runs the [[Ivy Bridge (microarchitecture)|Ivy Bridge]] iteration, and the Surface Pro 2 runs the [[Haswell (microarchitecture)|Haswell]] iteration. The Surface Pro 3 added the Haswell Core i3 and Core i7 variants.

The 2019 [[Surface Pro X]] uses a custom ARM64 SOC, the Microsoft SQ1.

=== Storage ===
The Surface devices are released in six internal storage capacities: 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 [[Gigabyte|GB]] and 1 [[Terabyte|TB]]. With the release of the third generation, the 32 GB model was discontinued. All models also feature a [[microSD]]XC card slot, located behind the kickstand, which allow for the use of [[memory cards]] up to 200 GB.

Surface devices have a different amount of non-replaceable [[random-access memory|RAM]], ranging from 2 to 32 GB, attached to the motherboard.

Microsoft's Surface/Storage site revealed that the 32 GB Surface RT has approximately 16 GB of user-available storage and the 64 GB Surface RT has roughly 45 GB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-surface-pro-how-much-usable-storage-will-it-really-have/|title=Microsoft's Surface Pro: How much usable storage will it really have?|last=Foley|first=Mary Jo|website=ZDNet|language=en|access-date=2019-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== External ports ===
On the left or right side of most Surface tablet, there is a full-size [[USB]] [[USB hardware#Host and device interface receptacles|Type A]] port (except the [[Surface Pro X]] and [[Microsoft Surface Go|Surface Go]]), and a 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm headphone/microphone jack (except the Surface Pro X). Older devices commonly had a [[Mini DisplayPort]] (or a [[HDMI|micro-HDMI]] port on even older models), however these ports have been replaced with [[USB-C|USB C]] ports since the 7th Surface Pro generation and Surface Go. All surface devices have Microsoft's magnetic Surface Connect port, for charging and data, and come with Surface Connect power cables, although devices that have them can also be charged over their USB C ports. All the devices have an accessory spine/Cover Port along the bottom that has not changed in dimensions. The ports have been moved in different locations throughout the various generations of Surface Pros/Surfaces, and beginning with the Surface Pro 3, Microsoft moved to a fin-style Surface Connect port.

=== Cellular connectivity ===
While all Surface devices come in the [[Wi-Fi]] only models, some generations also feature the Wi-Fi with a [[Cellular network|cellular]] support. The cellular variants, however, do not support circuit-switched voice calls and texts, allowing only data connectivity. The cellular models have a [[Subscriber identity module#Card sizes|micro-SIM]] slot at the bottom of the device, next to the Type Cover connecting pins.

=== External color and kickstand ===
The exterior of the earlier generations of Surface (2012 tablet, Pro, and Pro 2) is made of ''VaporMg'' [[magnesium]] alloy giving a semi-glossy black durable finish that Microsoft calls "dark titanium".&lt;ref name="windowscentral1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.windowscentral.com/surface-pro-3-ama-reddit-panos-panay |title=Panos Panay and the Surface team just finished their Reddit AMA, here are the highlights |publisher=Windows Central |date=May 27, 2014 |accessdate=October 27, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021220448/https://www.windowscentral.com/surface-pro-3-ama-reddit-panos-panay |archivedate=October 21, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the design of Surface was to feature a full "VaporMg" design, but the production models ditched this and went with a "VaporMg" coating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://macdailynews.com/2012/07/09/microsoft-reportedly-dumps-vapormg-chassis-will-use-it-only-as-surface-treatment/ |title=Microsoft reportedly dumps 'VaporMg' chassis, will use 'VaporMg' only as 'surface treatment' – MacDailyNews - Welcome Home |publisher=Macdailynews.com |accessdate=October 27, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164232/http://macdailynews.com/2012/07/09/microsoft-reportedly-dumps-vapormg-chassis-will-use-it-only-as-surface-treatment/ |archivedate=October 21, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later devices moved towards a matte gray finish showing the actual magnesium color through the semi-transparent top coating.&lt;ref name="windowscentral1"/&gt; The Surface Laptop is available in four colors: platinum, graphite gold, burgundy, and cobalt blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thorp-Lancaster|first1=Dan|title=Surface Laptop's four colors only available on single model in U.S. {{!}} Windows Central|url=http://www.windowscentral.com/surface-laptops-4-colors-only-available-single-model-us|accessdate=May 2, 2017|work=Windows Central|date=May 2, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503004915/http://www.windowscentral.com/surface-laptops-4-colors-only-available-single-model-us|archivedate=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Surface and Surface Pro lines feature a kickstand which flips out from the back of the device to prop it up, allowing the device to be stood up at an angle hands-free. According to Microsoft, this is great for watching movies, video chatting, and typing documents. According to some reviewers, this kickstand is uncomfortable to use in one's lap and means the device won't fit on shallow desks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Westover |first=Brian |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2426263,00.asp |title=Microsoft Surface 3 Review &amp; Rating |work=PCWorld |accessdate=July 12, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150819121630/http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2426263,00.asp |archivedate=August 19, 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation has a kickstand that can be set to a 22 degrees angle position. The second generation added a 55 degrees angle position which according to Microsoft makes the device more comfortable to type on the lap. The Surface 3 features three angle positions: 22, 44, and 60 degrees. The Surface Pro 3 is the first device to have a continuous kickstand that can be set at any angles between 22 and 150 degrees. With the fifth-generation Surface Pro, Microsoft added an additional 15 degrees of rotation to the hinge bringing the widest possible angle to 165 degrees, or what Microsoft calls "Studio Mode".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.windowscentral.com/should-you-buy-surface-pro-4-instead-new-surface-pro|title=Should you buy the Surface Pro 4 instead of the new Surface Pro?|work=Windows Central|access-date=June 12, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616032108/https://www.windowscentral.com/should-you-buy-surface-pro-4-instead-new-surface-pro|archivedate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface Book ===
{{Main|Surface Book}}
On October 6, 2015, Microsoft unveiled the [[Surface Book]], a 2-in-1 detachable with a mechanically attached, durable hardware keyboard. It became the first Surface device to be marketed as a laptop instead of a tablet. The device has a teardrop design.

The Surface Book has what Microsoft calls a "dynamic fulcrum hinge" which allows the device to support the heavier notebook/screen portion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Webster |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/6/9464187/surface-book-hinge-gifs |title=This is how Surface Book's crazy hinge works |publisher=The Verge |date=October 6, 2015 |accessdate=October 27, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021164018/https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/6/9464187/surface-book-hinge-gifs |archivedate=October 21, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Surface Studio uses a "zero-gravity hinge" to be placed at multiple angles, from standing up to a drafting table position at 20 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2016/10/26/microsoft-surface-studio-turns-pc-into-draft-tablet-first-look/92764984/ |title=Microsoft Surface Studio turns PC into draft tablet: First look |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=October 26, 2016 |accessdate=October 27, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021163601/https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/baig/2016/10/26/microsoft-surface-studio-turns-pc-into-draft-tablet-first-look/92764984/ |archivedate=October 21, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another unique aspect of the Surface Book is an available [[Video card#Dedicated vs integrated graphics|discrete graphics]] adapter, contained in the keyboard module. This module can then be detached while the Surface Book is running, in which case the system automatically switches to the [[Video card#Dedicated vs integrated graphics|integrated graphics]] in the tablet unit.

On October 26, 2016, Microsoft unveiled an additional configuration, called the Surface Book with Performance Base, which has an upgraded processor and a longer battery life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-book/overview|title=Surface Book - The Ultimate i5 or i7 powered Laptop Computer|website=www.microsoft.com|language=en-us|access-date=January 26, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170127002317/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-book/overview|archivedate=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second generation Surface Book 2 was announced on October 17, 2017, introducing an upgraded ceramic hinge for stability, and lighter overall weight distribution. A 15-inch model was added to the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/19/surface-book-2-panos-panay-interview/|title=The Surface Book 2's secret weapon is ceramic, says Panos Panay|work=Engadget|access-date=October 21, 2017|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021022504/https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/19/surface-book-2-panos-panay-interview/|archivedate=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface Laptop ===
{{Main|Surface Laptop}}
[[File:SurfaceLaptopBurgundy.png|thumb|Surface Laptop in Burgundy color]]
On May 3, 2017, Microsoft unveiled the [[Surface Laptop]], a non-detachable version of the Surface Book claiming to have the thinnest touch-enabled LCD panel of its kind.&lt;ref name="SurfLap"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4020089/windows-10-in-s-mode-faq|title=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its permanently attached hardware keyboard comes in four colors and uses the same kind of fabric as the Type Cover accessories for the tablets. The device comes with the newly announced [[Windows 10 S]] operating system, which enables faster boot times at the expense of the ability to download and install programs from the web instead of the [[Microsoft Store (digital)|Microsoft Store]]. Users can switch to a fully enabled version of Windows 10 for free.&lt;ref name="SurfLap" /&gt;

=== Surface Studio ===
{{Main|Surface Studio}}
On October 26, 2016, Microsoft announced a 28-inch all-in-one desktop PC, the [[Surface Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surface Studio|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-studio|accessdate=October 27, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027063733/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-studio|archivedate=October 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device claims to have the thinnest LCD ever made in an all-in-one PC. All its components, including the processor and a surround-sound system, are located in a compact base on which the screen is mounted upon via a flexible, four-point hinge. The design allows the screen to fold down to a 20-degree angle for physical interaction with the user.&lt;ref name="SurfStud"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moynihan|first1=Tim|title=Look at Microsoft's Fancy Surface Studio All-in-One PC|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/look-microsofts-fancy-surface-studio-one-pc/|website=Wired|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=May 5, 2017|date=October 26, 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607194752/https://www.wired.com/2016/10/look-microsofts-fancy-surface-studio-one-pc/|archivedate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comes with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update preinstalled, but is optimized for the Windows 10 Creators Update released in April 2017.

=== Surface Hub ===
{{Main|Surface Hub}}
On January 21, 2015, Microsoft introduced a new device category under the Surface family: the Surface Hub. It is an 84-inch 120&amp;nbsp;Hz [[4K resolution|4K]] or 55-inch [[1080p]] [[multi-touch]], multi-pen, wall-mounted all-in-one device, aimed for [[collaboration]] and [[videoconferencing]] use of businesses. The device runs a variant of the Windows 10 operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surface Hub|url=https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-surface-hub/en-us|website=Microsoft.com|accessdate=January 22, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122044528/http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-surface-hub/en-us|archivedate=January 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface Neo ===
On October 2, 2019, Microsoft unveiled the Surface Neo, an upcoming dual-screen tablet. The device is a folio with two 9-inch displays that can be used in various configurations ("postures"), including a laptop-like form where a Bluetooth keyboard is attached to the bottom screen. Depending on its position, the remainder of the touchscreen can be used for different features; the keyboard can be attached at the top to use the bottom as a [[Touchpad|trackpad]], or at the bottom to display a special area above the keyboard (the "wonderbar"), which can house tools such as emojis. The device will run a new Windows 10 edition known as [[Windows 10X]], which is designed specifically for this class of devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20889000/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date|title=Microsoft Surface Neo first look: the future of Windows 10X is dual-screen|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=2019-10-02|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface Duo ===
Alongside the Surface Neo, Microsoft also unveiled the Surface Duo, an upcoming dual-screen [[Android (operating system)|Android]] smartphone with a similar design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/3/20895268/microsoft-surface-duo-foldable-phone-dual-screen-android-hands-on-features-price-photos-video|title=A first look at Surface Duo, Microsoft’s foldable Android phone|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=2019-10-03|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Software ==
{{Main|Windows 10|Windows RT}}
Surface devices (except the Surface and Surface 2 models) sold since July 29, 2015, ship with the [[Windows 10]] operating system. Also, up to July 2016, older models which shipped with [[Windows 8.1]] were eligible for a free upgrade to Windows 10.

The original Surface and Surface 2 models use [[Windows RT]], a special version of Windows 8 designed for devices with [[ARM processor]]s and cannot be upgraded to Windows 10. However, there were several major updates made available after its initial release that include Windows RT 8.1, RT 8.1 Update 1, RT 8.1 August update, and  RT 8.1 Update 3. These older, ARM-based models of Surface are not compatible with Windows 10, but received several new features including a new Start menu similar to that found in early preview builds of Windows 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neowin.net/news/microsofts-windows-81-rt-update-3-said-to-include-smaller-start-menu---but-not-much-else |title=Microsoft's Windows 8.1 RT Update 3 said to include smaller Start menu - but not much else |publisher=Neowin.net |accessdate=October 26, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015045526/https://www.neowin.net/news/microsofts-windows-81-rt-update-3-said-to-include-smaller-start-menu---but-not-much-else |archivedate=October 15, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Surface Pro 4 and onward, all Surface devices support [[Windows Hello]] facial [[Biometrics|biometric authentication]] out of the box through its cameras and IR-sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = How to set up Windows Hello on your Surface device|url = https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2015/12/17/how-to-set-up-windows-hello-on-your-surface-device/|website = Microsoft Devices Blog|access-date = February 18, 2016|language = en-US|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160220132041/https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2015/12/17/how-to-set-up-windows-hello-on-your-surface-device/|archivedate = February 20, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Surface Pro 3 can utilize the Surface Pro 4 Type Cover with Fingerprint ID to gain Windows Hello support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Should you upgrade your Surface Pro 2 or Surface Pro 3 to the Surface Pro 4?|url = http://www.windowscentral.com/should-upgrade-surface-pro-2-pro-3-to-surface-pro-4|website = Windows Central|access-date = February 18, 2016|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160225114202/http://www.windowscentral.com/should-upgrade-surface-pro-2-pro-3-to-surface-pro-4|archivedate = February 25, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tablet mode ===
The Windows 10 user interface has two modes: desktop mode and tablet mode. When a keyboard is connected to the Surface, Windows 10 runs in desktop mode; when it is removed or folded around the back, Windows 10 runs in tablet mode.

When running in tablet mode, the start menu and all the apps run in full screen. All running apps are hidden from the taskbar and a back button appears. Swiping from the top closes the app while swiping from the left evokes the Task View and swiping from the right evokes the Action Center.

=== Apps===
Several of the included apps updated with Windows 10 are: [[Mail (Windows)|Mail]], [[People (Windows)|People]], [[Calendar (Windows)|Calendar]], Camera, [[Microsoft Edge]], [[Xbox LIVE|Xbox app]], [[OneNote]], Photos, [[Sound Recorder (Windows)|Voice Recorder]], Phone Companion, [[Calculator (Windows)|Calculator]], [[Windows Fax and Scan|Scan]], Alarms &amp; Clock, and the [[Microsoft Store (digital)|Microsoft Store]]. Other apps include [[Bing Maps|Maps]], [[Movies &amp; TV (Microsoft service)|Movies &amp; TV]], [[Groove (Microsoft service)|Groove Music]], Microsoft Solitaire Collection and the [[MSN]] apps: Money, News, Weather, and Sports.

Surface devices come preloaded with the [[Microsoft OneNote|OneNote]] app for taking handwritten notes. Windows 10 also features a text input panel with [[handwriting recognition]] which automatically converts handwriting to text.

The [[Microsoft Edge]] browser features an inking function which allows handwritten annotations directly on webpages.

Microsoft has ported its [[Microsoft Office Mobile|Office suite]] for use on Windows 10 devices, including the Surface devices running Windows 10. As the screen size on these devices exceed 10 inches, the apps require an [[Office 365]] subscription to edit documents, although it is not needed to view and print them.

Surface devices have an internal microphone and speakers optimized for the [[Cortana (software)|Cortana]] [[intelligent personal assistant|personal assistant]] feature included on Windows 10 devices.

Third-party applications that have been designed with the pen and touch interaction of Surface in mind include Drawboard PDF and Sketchable.

=== Specialized software ===
Prior to the release of Windows 10, on Surface Pro 3 Microsoft made the Surface Hub app available, which allowed the adjustment of Pen pressure sensitivity and button functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2014/10/13/surfacehubapp/#j7oTPr6RQugaoc7A.97|title=The brand new Surface Hub application is now available in the Windows Store - Microsoft Devices BlogMicrosoft Devices Blog|website=blogs.windows.com|language=en-US|access-date=February 26, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227233247/https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2014/10/13/surfacehubapp/#j7oTPr6RQugaoc7A.97|archivedate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Surface Hub app was renamed "Surface" following the launch of the Surface Hub device. Additionally, toggles to control sound quality and to disable the capacitive Windows button on the Surface 3 and Pro 3 devices were included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/apps-and-windows-store/surface-app?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined|title=Microsoft Surface app {{!}} Adjust Surface Pen settings {{!}} Disable Windows button|last=Microsoft|website=www.microsoft.com|language=en-US|access-date=February 26, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227234605/https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/apps-and-windows-store/surface-app?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined|archivedate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Surface Pro 3 and the Surface Pen based on N-Trig technology, Microsoft added the capability to launch OneNote from the lock screen without logging in by pressing the purple button at the top of the pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/touch-mouse-and-search/surface-pen?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined|title=Microsoft Surface Pen with two side buttons|last=Microsoft|website=www.microsoft.com|language=en-US|access-date=February 26, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227150053/https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/touch-mouse-and-search/surface-pen?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined|archivedate=February 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft added sections to Windows 10 settings that have the ability to control the functions of the buttons on the Surface Pen.

{{Main|List of Surface accessories}}
[[File:Microsoft Surface with Touch Cover 2.jpg|thumb|The 2012 Surface tablet with Touch Cover 2 attached]]
Microsoft offer several Surface accessories, most of which are Bluetooth connected devices. Among these are the Surface Pen, the keyboard covers, and the Surface Dial.

There are two main versions of the keyboard covers that connect via the Accessory Spine on the Surface tablets. The now discontinued Touch Cover, and the ever-evolving Type Cover. They feature a multi-touch trackpad, and a full QWERTY keyboard (with pre-defined action keys in place of the function row, though the function row is still accessible via the function button). The covers are made of various soft-touch materials and connect to the Surface with a polycarbonate spine with pogo pins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tabletpcreview.com/review/microsoft-type-cover-with-fingerprint-id-review/|title=Microsoft Type Cover with Fingerprint ID Review|work=TabletPCReview.com|access-date=June 12, 2017|language=en-US|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607231916/http://www.tabletpcreview.com/review/microsoft-type-cover-with-fingerprint-id-review/|archivedate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2270287|title=[Q] MS Surface Cover Connector Pinout|website=XDA Developers|language=en|access-date=June 12, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511230226/https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2270287|archivedate=May 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft sells the Surface Pen, an active-digitzer pen, separate of Surface, but included it in all Surface tablets until the fifth-generation Surface Pro where it was removed. The Surface Pen is designed to integrate with inking capabilities on Windows including OneNote&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/office-apps/take-notes-with-onenote|title=Using OneNote on Microsoft Surface|last=Microsoft|website=www.microsoft.com|language=en-US|access-date=June 12, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704024334/http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/office-apps/take-notes-with-onenote|archivedate=July 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Windows Ink Workspace.

The Surface Dial was introduced alongside the Surface Studio, and is a computer wheel designed to work on-screen with the Surface Studio and fifth-generation Surface Pro. Previous Surface Pro devices were updated to support it as well.

=== Television commercial ===
In October 2012, Microsoft aired its first [[television commercial|commercial]], directed by [[Jon M. Chu|Jon Chu]], for the Surface product line. The first 30-second commercial is the Surface Movement which focus on Windows RT version of the [[Surface 1|first generation of Surface]] with detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Microsoft's first Surface commercial shows off click-in keyboard [video]|url=http://bgr.com/2012/10/16/microsoft-surface-tablet-commercial-windows-8/|accessdate=October 7, 2015|work=BGR|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20151008180510/http://bgr.com/2012/10/16/microsoft-surface-tablet-commercial-windows-8/|archivedate=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It first aired during [[Dancing with the Stars]] commercial break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Microsoft 'Surface' Has Top Tablet Ad|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/185552/microsoft-surface-has-top-tablet-ad.html|accessdate=October 7, 2015|work=MediaPost|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208130636/http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/185552/microsoft-surface-has-top-tablet-ad.html|archivedate=December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Partnership with NFL ===
In 2014, Microsoft announced a five-year, $400 million deal with the [[National Football League]], in which Surface became the official tablet computer brand of the NFL. As part of the partnership, special, ruggedized Surface Pro 2 devices were issued to teams for use on the sidelines, allowing coaches and players view and annotate footage of previous plays. The partnership was initially hampered by television commentators, who erroneously referred to the devices as being an "iPad" on several occasions. Microsoft has since stated that it "coached" commentators on properly referring to the devices on-air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Microsoft redesigned the Surface Pro for the NFL|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/12/18/how-microsoft-redesigned-surface-pro-for-nfl/|website=Engadget|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630193229/http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/18/how-microsoft-redesigned-surface-pro-for-nfl/|archivedate=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The NFL Says Goodbye to the Polaroid, Hello to Microsoft's Surface Tablet|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-05-21/the-nfl-says-goodbye-to-the-polaroid-hello-to-microsofts-surface-tablet|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128210343/http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-05-21/the-nfl-says-goodbye-to-the-polaroid-hello-to-microsofts-surface-tablet|archivedate=January 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On the sidelines: how the NFL is making use of the Surface Pro 2|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/12/19/how-the-nfl-makes-use-of-surface-pro-2/|website=Engadget|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630193801/http://www.engadget.com/2014/12/19/how-the-nfl-makes-use-of-surface-pro-2/|archivedate=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=After Coaching From Microsoft, NFL Announcers Have Gotten Very Good At Identifying Surface Tablets|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/nfl-announcers-surface-tablets-2014-10#|accessdate=June 4, 2015|work=Business Insider|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413111417/http://www.businessinsider.com/nfl-announcers-surface-tablets-2014-10|archivedate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Designed on Surface ===
On January 11, 2016, Microsoft announced a collaboration with POW! WOW!. It includes a group of artists from around the world that utilizes various Surface devices, such as the Surface Pro 4 and the Surface Book, to create a total of 17 murals. The artists are filmed using their Surface devices and explain how they integrate Surface into their workflow. The final products are then posted to YouTube that accompanies a post on the Microsoft Devices blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Jasper Wong creates the first in a series of 17 murals for Designed on Surface|url = https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2016/01/14/jasper-wong-creates-the-first-in-a-series-of-17-murals-for-designed-on-surface/|website = Microsoft Devices Blog|access-date = February 18, 2016|language = en-US|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160225172132/https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2016/01/14/jasper-wong-creates-the-first-in-a-series-of-17-murals-for-designed-on-surface/|archivedate = February 25, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States Department of Defense ===
On February 17, 2016, Microsoft announced that alongside the US Department of Defense's plans to upgrade to Windows 10, that it has approved Surface devices and certified them for use through the Defense Information Systems Agency Unified Capabilities Approved Products List. Surface Book, Surface Pro 4, Surface Pro 3, and Surface 3 have all been approved as Multifunction Mobile Devices, thus meeting the necessary requirements for security and compatibility with other systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Surface now approved for U.S. Department of Defense|url = https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2016/02/17/surface-now-approved-for-u-s-department-of-defense/|website = Microsoft Devices Blog|access-date = February 18, 2016|language = en-US|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160225165504/https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2016/02/17/surface-now-approved-for-u-s-department-of-defense/|archivedate = February 25, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
{{update|date=June 2015}}

Reviews of the first-generation Surface RT by critics have ranged broadly. The hardware received mostly positive reviews, while the software and overall experience were mixed. ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' reviewer Mathew Honan stated that while "This is one of the most exciting pieces of hardware I’ve ever used. It is extremely well-designed; meticulous even," the tablets are "likely to confuse many of Microsoft’s longtime customers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mathew |last=Honan |url=https://www.wired.com/reviews/2012/10/microsoft-surface/all/ |title=Review: Microsoft Surface Tablet |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast Digital]] |date=October 23, 2012 |accessdate=January 17, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104133423/http://www.wired.com/reviews/2012/10/microsoft-surface/all |archivedate=January 4, 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TechCrunch]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/microsoft-surface-rt-review/ Don’t Call The New Microsoft Surface RT A Tablet, This Is A PC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705102955/https://techcrunch.com/2012/10/23/microsoft-surface-rt-review/ |date=July 5, 2017 }}, ''[[TechCrunch]]'', October 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Matt Buchanan at ''[[BuzzFeed]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Matt.

The Surface Pro 3 has received positive reviewers. [[David Pogue]] suggested "The upshot is that, with hardly any thickness or weight penalty, the kickstand and the Type Cover let you transform your 1.8-pound tablet into an actual, fast, luxury laptop". Pogue said that the Surface Pro 3's form factor works well as a tablet, in contrast to the Surface Pro 2, whose bulk and weight limited its appeal as a tablet. Pogue also stated that the new multi-stage kickstand, 3:2 screen aspect ratio, and new Type Cover 3 detachable keyboard made it a competent laptop. Another advantage of the Surface Pro 3 is that it is considered a tablet by the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] and [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]], despite its hardware which makes it capable of running all [[x86]] Windows programs. This is advantageous in air travel, since a tablet can be used during takeoff or landing, and a tablet can be left in a bag when going through a TSA scanner machine, neither of which apply to a laptop.&lt;ref name="BI_Pogue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/surface-pro-3-david-pogue-review-2014-5 |title=POGUE: The Surface Pro 3 Is The One Time Windows 8 Isn't A Disaster |last=Eadicicco |first=Lisa |publisher=Business Insider |accessdate=May 24, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230314/http://www.businessinsider.com/surface-pro-3-david-pogue-review-2014-5 |archivedate=May 23, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the Surface Pro 3 comes closest to the [[Microsoft Tablet PC]] concept that company founder [[Bill Gates]] announced in 2001,&lt;!--&lt;ref name="Yahoo"/&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="Verge_review"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/23/5743416/microsoft-surface-pro-3-review |title=Microsoft Surface Pro 3 review |last=Bohn |first=Dieter |date=May 23, 2014 |work=The Verge |publisher=Vox Media |accessdate=May 24, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524003859/http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/23/5743416/microsoft-surface-pro-3-review |archivedate=May 24, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BI_Pogue"/&gt; being the first Surface to become a credible laptop replacement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/27/surface-head-panos-panay-talks-the-death-and-rebirth-of-laptoptablet-hybrid/ |title=Microsoft's Panos Panay talks about the death and rebirth of the Surface |publisher=MobileSyrup.com |date=May 27, 2016 |accessdate=October 26, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030144006/http://mobilesyrup.com/2016/05/27/surface-head-panos-panay-talks-the-death-and-rebirth-of-laptoptablet-hybrid/ |archivedate=October 30, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine included Microsoft Surface Pro 3 in the list of the 25 best inventions of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://time.com/3594971/the-25-best-inventions-of-2014/|title = The 25 Best Inventions of 2014|date = November 20, 2014|accessdate = January 19, 2015|website = Time.com|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150117072730/http://time.com/3594971/the-25-best-inventions-of-2014/|archivedate = January 17, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Surface 3 (non-Pro) has received generally positive reviews from computer critics. They praised Microsoft's shift from [[ARM architecture|ARM]] architecture toward [[x86]], and therefore from [[Windows RT]] to a regular Windows OS.

=== Industry response ===
When Surface was first announced, critics noted that the device represented a significant departure for Microsoft, as the company had previously relied exclusively on third-party OEMs to produce devices running Windows, and began shifting towards a first-party hardware model with similarities to that of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With the Surface, Microsoft just started writing its next chapter|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/19/3097726/surface-microsoft-next-chapter/in/2859835|publisher=The Verge|accessdate=June 16, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501233633/http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/19/3097726/surface-microsoft-next-chapter/in/2859835|archivedate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-57455682-75/microsoft-breaks-tradition-with-microsoft-surface-tablets/|title=Microsoft breaks tradition with Microsoft Surface tablets|publisher=CNET|accessdate=June 16, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528131710/http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-57455682-75/microsoft-breaks-tradition-with-microsoft-surface-tablets/|archivedate=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Ballmer]] said that like [[Xbox]], Surface was an example of the sort of hardware products Microsoft will release in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Gavin.

The need for the Surface to market an ARM-compatible version of Windows was questioned by analysts because of recent developments in the PC industry; both Intel and AMD introduced x86-based system-on-chip designs for Windows 8, [[Atom (system on chip)|Atom "Clover Trail"]] and [[AMD Accelerated Processing Unit#Jaguar architecture (Kabini and Temash)|"Temash"]] respectively, in response to the growing competition from ARM licensees. In particular, Intel claimed that Clover Trail-based tablets could provide battery life rivaling that of ARM devices; in a test by ''[[PC World]]'', Samsung's Clover Trail-based Ativ Smart PC was shown to have battery life exceeding that of the first gen ARM-based Surface. Peter Bright of ''[[Ars Technica]]'' argued that Windows RT had no clear purpose, since the power advantage of ARM-based devices was "nowhere near as clear-cut as it was two years ago", and that users would be better off purchasing Office 2013 themselves because of the removed features and licensing restrictions of Office RT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chacos|first=Brad|title=Why Windows RT is hurtling toward disaster|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/microsoft-windows/why-windows-rt-hurtling-toward-disaster-210995?page=0,1|publisher=InfoWorld|accessdate=January 27, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002053912/http://www.infoworld.com/d/microsoft-windows/why-windows-rt-hurtling-toward-disaster-210995?page=0,1|archivedate=October 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Can Intel Challenge ARM's Mobile Dominance?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2012/11/09/can-intel-challenge-arms-mobile-dominance/|work=Great Speculations|publisher=[[Forbes.com]]|accessdate=November 22, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127093819/http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2012/11/09/can-intel-challenge-arms-mobile-dominance/|archivedate=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bright|first=Peter|title=Now that it's here, is there a place for Windows RT?|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/now-that-its-here-is-there-a-place-for-windows-rt/|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=November 22, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112175458/http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/now-that-its-here-is-there-a-place-for-windows-rt/|archivedate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] reported from inside sources that Surface sales were behind expectations, particularly of the ARM-based Surface model. Microsoft had originally projected sales of 2 million Surface units during the final quarter of 2012, a total of 1.5 million Surface devices had been sold since launch with Surface Pro accounting for 400,000 of these sales. The more expensive Surface Pro, with its Intel CPU that makes it a full-fledged Windows laptop PC, despite its compromises, was successful compared to other OEMs' first-generation Windows 8 [[Ultrabook]] hybrids which were larger and/or more expensive.

In July 2013, Steve Ballmer revealed that the Surface hasn't sold as well as he hoped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cultofmac.com/237379/steve-ballmer-admits-microsofts-ipad-killer-is-a-flop/|title= Steve Ballmer Admits Microsoft's iPad-Killer Is A Flop|publisher= Cult of Mac|date= July 26, 2013|accessdate= September 4, 2013|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130823090205/http://www.cultofmac.com/237379/steve-ballmer-admits-microsofts-ipad-killer-is-a-flop/|archivedate= August 23, 2013|df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported that Microsoft had made a loss of {{currency|900 million|USD}} due to the lackluster Surface sales.

The poor sales of the ARM-based Surface tablet had been credited to the continuing market dominance of Microsoft's competitors in the tablet market. Particularly, Apple's [[iPad]] retained its dominance due its App store offering the most tablet-optimized applications. Most OEMs opted to produce tablets running Google Android, which came in a wide variety of sizes and prices (albeit with mixed success among most OEMs), and Google Play had the second-largest selection of tablet applications. By contrast there was a limited amount of software designed specifically for Surface's operating system, Windows RT, the selection which was even weaker than [[Windows Phone]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Brad Reed |url=http://bgr.com/2014/07/09/microsoft-surface-pro-3-sales/ |title=Microsoft Surface Pro 3 sales: Better than expected? |publisher=BGR |date=July 9, 2014 |accessdate=October 26, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20161027153749/http://bgr.com/2014/07/09/microsoft-surface-pro-3-sales/ |archivedate=October 27, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, OEMs reported that most customers felt Intel-based tablets were more appropriate for use in business environments, as they were compatible with the much more widely available x86 programs while Windows RT was not. Microsoft's subsequent efforts have been focused upon refining the Surface Pro and making it a viable competitor in the premium ultra-mobile PC category, against other [[Ultrabook]]s and the [[MacBook Air]], while discontinuing development of ARM-powered Surface devices as the Surface 3 (non-Pro) had an Intel x86 CPU (albeit with lower performance than the Surface Pro 3).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bott |first=Ed |url=https://www.zdnet.com/how-microsofts-surface-pro-3-marketing-push-backfired-7000030723/ |title=How Microsoft's Surface Pro 3 marketing push backfired |publisher=ZDNet |date=June 19, 2014 |accessdate=October 26, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205002015/http://www.zdnet.com/how-microsofts-surface-pro-3-marketing-push-backfired-7000030723/ |archivedate=December 5, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reported issues ==
Users on Microsoft's support forum reported that some Touch Covers were splitting at the seam where it connects to the tablet, exposing its wiring. A Microsoft spokesperson stated that the company was aware of the issue, and would offer free replacements for those who have been affected by the defect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surface tablet's Touch Cover splits at seam, users gripe|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-57547549-75/surface-tablets-touch-cover-splits-at-seam-users-gripe/|publisher=CNET|accessdate=November 15, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402195359/http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-57547549-75/surface-tablets-touch-cover-splits-at-seam-users-gripe/|archivedate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Microsoft Surface Touch Cover splits within days, some users complain|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/nov/09/microsoft-surface-cover-flaw|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=November 15, 2012|location=London|first=Charles|last=Arthur|date=November 9, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925023957/http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2012/nov/09/microsoft-surface-cover-flaw|archivedate=September 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other users reported issues with audio randomly stuttering or muting on the Surface tablet while in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Surface updates out now, make apps load faster|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/microsoft-surface-updates-out-now-make-apps-load-faster-1112497|publisher=TechRadar|accessdate=November 15, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121116024129/http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/microsoft-surface-updates-out-now-make-apps-load-faster-1112497|archivedate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wi-Fi connectivity issues were also reported.

With the original Surface Pro, Microsoft acknowledged issues encountered by some users with its stylus pen, including intermittent pen failures, and with older applications that do not have complete pen support due to the different [[API]]s used by Surface Pro's stylus drivers. In the latter case, Microsoft has indicated that it is working with software vendors to ensure better compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft investigating issue with pen detection affecting subset of Surface Pro owners|url=https://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2013/02/18/microsoft-investigating-issue-with-pen-detection-affecting-subset-of-surface-pro-owners/|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=February 27, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224031315/http://thenextweb.com/microsoft/2013/02/18/microsoft-investigating-issue-with-pen-detection-affecting-subset-of-surface-pro-owners/|archivedate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surface Pro lacks full pen support in key apps, Microsoft says it's on the case (updated)|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/02/11/surface-pro-owners-decry-lack-of-full-pen-support-in-key-apps/|work=Engadget|accessdate=February 27, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216014950/http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/11/surface-pro-owners-decry-lack-of-full-pen-support-in-key-apps/|archivedate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for later models beginning with the Surface Pro 3, the N-Trig digital pen digitizer system has attained high pen compatibility with older applications thanks to a regularly updated, optional WinTab driver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826 |title=Download Surface Pro 3 from Official Microsoft Download Center |publisher=Microsoft.com |date=January 9, 2016 |accessdate=October 26, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015045507/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826 |archivedate=October 15, 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Issues had also been experienced with slow Wi-Fi connectivity, and the device not properly returning from standby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surface RT gets improved speaker volume with latest firmware updates|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/14/4330516/surface-rt-improved-speaker-volume-surface-firmware-updates|work=The Verge|accessdate=June 17, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607045644/http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/14/4330516/surface-rt-improved-speaker-volume-surface-firmware-updates|archivedate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surface Pro has trouble waking up|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/380755/surface-pro-has-trouble-waking-up|work=PC Pro|accessdate=June 17, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529192251/http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/380755/surface-pro-has-trouble-waking-up|archivedate=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[iFixit]] has awarded the Surface Pro its worst ever repairability rating, but CEO Kyle Wiens claims that it is due to incompetence rather than deliberate design choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/28/ios_repairs/ |title=iFixit boss: Apple has 'done everything it can to put repair guys out of business' |last1=Nichols |first1=Shaun |date=March 28, 2012 |website=www.theregister.co.uk |publisher=The Register |accessdate=March 28, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328121041/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/28/ios_repairs/ |archivedate=March 28, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
