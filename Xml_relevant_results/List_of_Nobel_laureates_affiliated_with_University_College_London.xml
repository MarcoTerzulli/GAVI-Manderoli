[[File:University College London (front quad).jpg|thumb|University College London (front quad). As of October 2018, 33 Nobel laureates have been affiliated UCL.]]
This '''list of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University College London''' comprehensively shows the alumni, faculty members as well as researchers of [[University College London]] (UCL) who were awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] or the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]]. The Nobel Prizes, established by the 1895 will of [[Alfred Nobel]], are awarded to individuals who make outstanding contributions in the fields of [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]], [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature]], [[Nobel Peace Prize|Peace]], [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]], and [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/|title=Alfred Nobel – The Man Behind the Nobel Prize|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An associated prize, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (commonly known as the [[Nobel Prize in Economics]]), was instituted by Sweden's central bank, [[Sveriges Riksbank]], in 1968 and first awarded in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/|title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2018, [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|33 Nobel laureates]] have been affiliated with University College London as alumni, faculty members and researchers, and 29 of them are officially listed as "UCL's Nobel Laureates" by the university.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/about/who/history/nobel-prize-winners|title=Nobel prize winners|last=UCL|date=2018-01-11|website=About UCL|language=en|access-date=2019-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 33 laureates, 9 are UCL alumni (graduates and attendees) and 12 have been long-term academic members of the UCL faculty. University College London has the most Nobel affiliations among colleges and schools of the [[University of London]].

== Inclusion criteria ==

=== General rules ===
[[File:University College, London quadrangle - geograph.org.uk - 727068..jpg|thumb|University College London]]
The university affiliations in this list are all official academic affiliations such as degree programs and official academic employment. Non-academic affiliations such as advisory committee and administrative staff are generally excluded. The official academic affiliations fall into three categories: 1) Alumni (graduates and attendees), 2) Long-term Academic Staff, and 3) Short-term Academic Staff. Graduates are defined as those who hold [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor's]], [[Master's degree|Master's]], [[Doctorate]], or equivalent degrees from University College London, while attendees are those who formally enrolled in a degree program at UCL but did not complete the program; thus, honorary degrees, posthumous degrees, summer attendees, exchange students, and auditing students are excluded. The category of "Long-term Academic Staff" consists of [[Academic tenure|tenure]]/tenure-track and equivalent academic positions, while that of "Short-term Academic Staff" consists of lecturers (without tenure), [[Postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral researchers]] (postdocs), visiting professors/scholars (visitors), and equivalent academic positions. At UCL, the specific academic title solely determines the type of affiliation, regardless of the actual time the position was held by a laureate.

Further explanations on "visitors" under "Short-term Academic Staff" are presented as follows. 1) All informal or personal visits are excluded from the list; 2) all employment-based visiting positions, which carry teaching/research duties, are included as affiliations in the list; 3) as for award/honor-based visiting positions, to minimize controversy this list takes a conservative view and includes the positions as affiliations only if the laureates were required to assume employment-level duty (teaching/research) or the laureates specifically classified the visiting positions as "affiliation" or similar in reliable sources such as their [[Curriculum vitae|curriculum vita]]. Finally, summer visitors are generally excluded from the list unless summer work yielded significant end products such as research publications and components of Nobel-winning work, since summer terms are not part of formal academic years.

=== Affiliated organisations ===
[[Francis Crick Institute]] (formerly UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation''',''' or UKCMRI), founded in 2010, has no direct affiliation with University College London and thus its affiliates are not counted as affiliates of UCL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crick.ac.uk/about-us/our-history|title=Our history|website=Crick|language=en|access-date=2019-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the founding director [[Paul Nurse]] is counted in the following list since the university is a founding partner of the institute (UKCMRI).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crick.ac.uk/news/2010-11-09-agreement-signed-to-establish-ukcmri|title=Agreement signed to establish UKCMRI|website=Crick|language=en|access-date=2019-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
