{{Campaignbox Spanish Civil War}}
The '''Catalonia Offensive''' ({{lang-ca|Ofensiva de Catalunya}}, {{lang-es|Ofensiva de Cataluña}}) was part of the [[Spanish Civil War]].  The [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist Army]] started the [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] on December 23, 1938, and rapidly conquered [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]]-held [[Catalonia]] with Barcelona (the Republic's [[capital city]] from October 1937).&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Helen. ''The Spanish Civil War. A Very Short Introduction.'' Oxford University Press. 2005. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;  Barcelona was captured on January 26, 1939. The Republican government headed for the French border. Thousands of people fleeing the [[Nationalists (Spain)|Nationalists]] also crossed the frontier in the following month, to be placed in [[internment camp]]s. [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] closed the border with France by February 10, 1939.

==Background==
After its defeat at the [[Battle of the Ebro]] the [[Spanish Republican Army|Republican Army]] was broken and would never recover. The Republicans had lost most of their armament and experienced units.&lt;ref name="autogenerated292"&gt;Preston, Paul. ''The Spanish Civil War. Reaction, Revolution &amp; Revenge.'' Harper Perennial. London. 2006. p.&amp;nbsp;292&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in October 1938 the Republican government agreed to withdraw the volunteers of the [[International Brigades]].&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''The Spanish Civil War. Reaction, Revolution &amp; Revenge.'' Harper Perennial. London. 2006. pp.&amp;nbsp;292–293&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the Nationalists received new supplies of ammunition, weapons and aircraft from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''The Spanish Civil War. Reaction, Revolution &amp; Revenge.'' Harper Perennial. London. 2006. p.&amp;nbsp;294&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, after the [[Munich Agreement]], the hope of an intervention of the Western democracies in order to aid the Republic against [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] vanished.&lt;ref name="autogenerated292"/&gt; [[Third French Republic|France]] had closed the frontier again in mid-June 1938 and frozen Republican financial assets in French banks.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Helen. ''The Spanish Civil War. A Very Short Introduction.'' Oxford University Press. 2005. p.&amp;nbsp;99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposing forces==

===Nationalists===
At the beginning of December, the [[rebel faction]] concentrated an [[Army Group]], the Army of the North, of 300,000&lt;ref name="autogenerated844"/&gt;–340,000&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939. Penguin Books. 2006. p. 372&lt;/ref&gt; men led by the general [[Fidel Dávila]] in order to conquer [[Catalonia]]. The Nationalists assembled their best divisions all along the front from the [[Pyrenees]] to the [[Mediterranean]]. Along the [[Segre (river)|Segre]] the Nationalists deployed Muñoz Grandes's [[Field army|Army]] of Urgel, Garcia Valiño's Army of Maestrazgo and Moscardo's Aragon Army; in the confluence of the Segre with the [[Ebro]] [[Gastone Gambara|Gambara]]'s Italian [[Corpo Truppe Volontarie|''Cuerpo Legionario Italiano'']] of four divisions (55,000 men) and Solchaga's Army Corps of Navarra; and in the Ebro the Yagüe's Moroccan Corps.&lt;ref name="autogenerated844"/&gt; The Nationalists also had, according to Beevor, 300 tanks, more than 500 aircraft (among them the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109E]] and [[Heinkel He 112|Heinkel 112]] fighters) and 1,400 cannon.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. 2001. London. pp. 372–373&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republicans===
{{main|Eastern Region Army Group}}
Opposing the Nationalists, the Republicans had Colonel Perea's East Army and Colonel [[Juan Modesto]]'s Ebro Army under the command of General [[Juan Hernandez Saravia]], commander of the Oriental Region's [[Army Group]], with 220,000&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939. Penguin Books. 2006. p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;–300,000&lt;ref name="autogenerated844"/&gt; men, many unarmed (Hernandez Saravia said that the Republican army had only 17,000 rifles for all Catalonia),&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. 2001. London. p. 847&lt;/ref&gt; 106 airplanes&lt;ref name="autogenerated368"/&gt; (most of them [[Polikarpov I-15|''Chatos'']]), 250 cannons and 40 [[T-26 tank|tanks]] (many of them unserviceable due to shortage of spare parts).&lt;ref name="autogenerated373"/&gt; The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government agreed to send to Catalonia a shipment of 250 aircraft, 250 tanks and 650 cannons,&lt;ref name="autogenerated844"/&gt; but the shipment did not reach [[Bordeaux]] until January 15 and only a small part of it crossed the border.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939.'' Penguin Books. 2006. p. 488&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, because of the international isolation of the Republic and the lack of food (according to Beevor, in Barcelona the ration per day was down to 100&amp;nbsp;grams of lentils)&lt;ref name="autogenerated368"/&gt; the morale of the government troops and civil population in the Republican zone was very low. The people only wished the end of the war: "...just let it be over, it doesn’t matter how it ends, but let it end now."&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Helen. ''The Spanish Civil War. A Very Short Introduction.'' Oxford University Press. 2005. p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
===Nationalist offensive===
The Nationalist offensive was planned for December&amp;nbsp;10, but was postponed to December 23.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt; On December&amp;nbsp;23, the Italians and the Navarreses crossed the Segre at [[Mequinenza]], broke the Republican lines, and advanced sixteen kilometres, but they were stopped by the V and XV Republican corps led by [[Enrique Líster|Lister]] on December 25. On the left flank, Muñoz Grandes and Garcia Valiño advanced towards [[Cervera]] and [[Artesa de Segre|Artesa]], but they were blocked by the [[Durruti Column|26th Republican Division]]. On the south, Yagüe's troops were held back by the Ebro's floodwater. The Republicans had stopped the first Nationalist attack; nevertheless, they had lost 40 aircraft in the first ten days of the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939.'' Penguin Books. 2006. p.&amp;nbsp;374&lt;/ref&gt;

On January&amp;nbsp;3, Solchaga attacked [[Les Borges Blanques]], Muñoz Grandes and Garcia Valiño occupied Artesa, and Yagüe crossed the Ebro. Moscardo attacked from Lleida and the Italians occupied Les Borges Blanques on January&amp;nbsp;5. The same day, the Republican army started a [[Battle of Valsequillo|surprise attack]] in [[Extremadura]] towards [[Peñarroya-Pueblonuevo|Peñarroya]] in order to divert Nationalist forces, but the offensive was halted after a few days and the Nationalist offensive in Catalonia continued.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939.'' Penguin Books. 2006. pp.&amp;nbsp;375–376&lt;/ref&gt; On January&amp;nbsp;9, the Moscardo's Aragon Army Corps joined Gambara at [[Mollerusa]] and broke the northern part of the front. The V and XV Republican Corps collapsed and retreated in disorder. On January&amp;nbsp;15, the Aragon and Maestrazgo Corps conquered Cervera and the Moroccan Corps after a one-day march of 50&amp;nbsp;km occupied [[Tarragona]]. By this day, the Nationalists had conquered a third of Catalonia, had taken 23,000 prisoners, and had killed 5,000 Republican soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939.'' Penguin Books. 2006. pp.&amp;nbsp;374–376&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fall of Barcelona===
The Republican government then attempted to organize a defense of Barcelona, ordering the general mobilization of all men to forty-five and militarized all the industry. Nevertheless, the successive defensive lines (L1, L2, L3) fell,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. 2001. London. p. 848&lt;/ref&gt; the Republican forces were outnumbered six to one and the Nationalist air force bombed Barcelona every day (40 times  between January 21 and 25).&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939. Penguin Books. 2006. pages 376 and 484&lt;/ref&gt; It became clear that the defense of the city was impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939.'' Penguin Books. 2006. p. 376&lt;/ref&gt; On January 22, Solchaga and Yagüe reached the [[Llobregat]] only a few miles west of Barcelona, Muñoz Grandes and Garcia Valiño attacked [[Sabadell]] and [[Terrassa]], and Gambara advanced to [[Badalona]]. The chief of staff of the Republican Army, [[Vicente Rojo Lluch|Rojo]] told the Republican prime minister [[Juan Negrín|Negrín]] that the front had ceased to exist so the government abandoned Barcelona after releasing most of its prisoners.&lt;ref name="autogenerated377"&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939.'' Penguin Books. 2006. p. 377&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of the Barcelona population fled from the city as well. On January 24, Garcia Valiño occupied [[Manresa]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. 2001. London. p. 845&lt;/ref&gt; and on January 25 the Nationalist vanguard occupied the [[Tibidabo]] in the outskirts of Barcelona.  The Nationalists finally occupied Barcelona on January 26,&lt;ref name="Preston, Paul 2002. p.374"&gt;Preston, Paul. ''Doves of War. Four women of Spain.'' Harper Collins. London. 2002. p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; and there were five days of looting by the Yagüe's ''[[Regulares]]''&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939.'' Penguin Books. 2006. p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; and extrajudicial killings (''paseos'').&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. London. 2001. p. 850&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retreat===
After the occupation of Barcelona, the Nationalist troops, tired from the long marches, slowed their advance but soon resumed their offensive, pursuing the retreating columns of Republican soldiers and civilians.&lt;ref name="autogenerated377"/&gt; On February 1, Negrín proposed, in the last meeting of the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] in the [[Sant Ferran Castle|Figueres Castle]], [[Capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] with the sole condition of respecting the lives of the vanquished and the holding of a plebiscite so the Spanish people could decide the form of government, but Franco did not accept.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The battle for Spain. The Spanish civil war.'' Penguin Books. 2006. London. pp. 380–381&lt;/ref&gt; On February 2, the Nationalists entered [[Girona]], arrived within 50 kilometers of the frontier on February 3,&lt;ref name="autogenerated382"/&gt; occupied [[Figueres]] on February 8 and Rojo ordered the Republican troops to withdraw to the French frontier.&lt;ref name="autogenerated382"/&gt; Hundreds of thousands of Republican soldiers, women, children and old men marched to the French frontier on foot and on carts, buses and trucks&lt;ref name="Preston, Paul 2002. p.374"/&gt; through bitterly cold sleet and snow. Their retreat was covered by units of the Republican Army, which carried out [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit and run]] attacks and ambushes.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939.'' Penguin Books. 2006. p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; The Nationalist air force and the [[Condor Legion]] bombed and strafed the roads leading to France.&lt;ref name="autogenerated295"&gt;Preston, Paul. ''The Spanish Civil War. Reaction, Revolution &amp; Revenge.'' Harper Perennial. London. 2006. p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; On January 28, the French government announced that civilians could cross the frontier and, on 5 February, the Republican soldiers as well.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. 2001. London. p. 854&lt;/ref&gt; Between 400,000&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. 2001. London. p. 860&lt;/ref&gt; and 500,000,&lt;ref name="autogenerated382"/&gt; Republican refugees crossed the frontier, among them the president of the Republic ([[Manuel Azaña]]), the prime minister (Juan Negrín) and the chief of staff of the Republican Army (Vicente Rojo), as well the president of Catalonia ([[Lluís Companys]]) and the members of the [[Catalan government]]. Negrín returned to Spain on February 9, but Azaña and Rojo refused to return.&lt;ref name="autogenerated295"/&gt; By February 9, the Nationalists reached the frontier, and on the following day the last units of Modesto's Army of the Ebro crossed into France and the Nationalists sealed the frontier.&lt;ref name="autogenerated844"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Military and political consequences===

[[File:Spanish Map 1939.PNG|thumb|Spain after the conclusion of the Catalonia Offensive. Nationalist Spain is in gray and Republican Spain is in white.]]
With the fall of Catalonia, the Republic lost the second largest city of the country, the Catalan war industry and a large part of its army (more than 200,000 soldiers).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. 2001. London. p. 854&lt;/ref&gt; On February 27, Azaña resigned and the same day [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] recognized the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist government]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Helen. ''The Spanish Civil War. A Very Short Introduction.'' Oxford University Press. 2005. p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Further military resistance became impossible and the war was lost for the Republic, despite the fact that 30% of Spain was still under Republican control after the offensive and Prime Minister [[Juan Negrín]] insisted that the Republic could continue to resist.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''The Spanish Civil War. Reaction, Revolution &amp; Revenge.'' Harper Perennial. London. 2006. p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catalonia autonomy was abolished. The [[Catalan language|Catalan]] language, the ''[[Sardana]]'' and Catalan Christian names were forbidden. All Catalan newspapers were requisitioned and the forbidden books retired and burned.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939.'' Penguin Books. London 2006. pp. 378–379&lt;/ref&gt; Even the inscriptions on tombs in the [[Montjuïc Cemetery]] commemorating [[Durruti]], [[Francisco Ascaso|Ascaso]] and [[Ferrer i Guàrdia|Ferrer i Guardia]] were removed.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''The Spanish Civil War.'' Penguin Books. 2001. London. pp. 850–851&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate of the Republican refugees===
The Republican exiles were interned in fifteen [[Concentration camps in France|improvised camps]] (mostly barbed-wire enclosures on the sand, without basic shelter, sanitary or cooking facilities)&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''Doves of War. Four women of Spain.'' Harper Collins. 2002. London. p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; by the French government in places such as [[Camp de concentration d'Argelès-sur-Mer|Argelès]], [[Gurs internment camp|Gurs]], [[Camp de Rivesaltes|Rivesaltes]] and [[Camp Vernet|Vernet]].&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939.'' Penguin Books. London 2006. pp. 411–412&lt;/ref&gt; The living conditions in the camps were very harsh: in the first six months, 14,672 refugees died from malnutrition or dysentery.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''Doves of War. Four women of Spain.'' Harper Collins. 2002. London. p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; The French government encouraged the refugees to return and, by the end of 1939, between 70,000&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Helen. ''The Spanish Civil War. A Very Short Introduction.'' Oxford University Press. 2005. p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and 180,000 refugees returned to Spain. However, 300,000 never returned.&lt;ref name="Beevor, Antony 1939. p. 412"&gt;Beevor, Antony. ''The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939.''
