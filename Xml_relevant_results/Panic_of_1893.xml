The '''Panic of 1893''' was a serious [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] in the  [[United States]] that began in 1893 and ended in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Business Cycles and Depressions: an Encyclopedia | editor1 = Glasner, David | editor2 = Cooley, Thomas F. | year = 1997 | location = New York | publisher = Garland Publishing | chapter = Panic of 1893 | author = Timberlake, Jr., Richard H. | pages = 516–18 | isbn = 0-8240-0944-4 | chapter-url-access = registration | chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/businesscyclesde00glas }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It deeply affected every sector of the economy, and produced political upheaval that led to the [[realigning election]] of [[1896 U.S. presidential election|1896]] and the [[presidency of William McKinley]].

==Causes==

One of the causes for the Panic of 1893 can be traced back to Argentina. Investment was encouraged by the Argentine agent bank, [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers]]. However, the 1890 wheat crop failure and [[Revolution of the Park|a coup in Buenos Aires]] ended further investments. In addition, speculations also collapsed in South African and Australian properties. Because European investors were concerned that these problems might spread, they started a run on gold in the [[United States Treasury|U.S. Treasury]]. [[Bullion coins|Specie]] was considered more valuable than paper money; when people were uncertain about the future, they [[hoarding|hoarded]] specie and rejected paper.&lt;ref name="Nelson, Scott Reynolds 2012. p. 189"&gt;Nelson, Scott Reynolds. 2012. A Nation of Deadbeats. New York: Alfred Knopf, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-depression-of-1893/|title=The Depression of 1893|website=eh.net|access-date=2019-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Gilded Age]] of the 1870s and 1880s, the United States had experienced economic growth and expansion, but much of this expansion depended on high international commodity prices. To exacerbate the problems with international investments, wheat prices crashed in 1893.&lt;ref name="Nelson, Scott Reynolds 2012. p. 189"/&gt;

One of the first clear signs of trouble came on February 20, 1893,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=155&amp;invol=396|title=IN RE RICE|work=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; twelve days before the inauguration of U.S. President [[Grover Cleveland]], with the appointment of receivers for the [[Reading Company|Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]], which had greatly overextended itself.&lt;ref&gt;James L. Holton, ''The Reading Railroad: History of a Coal Age Empire'', Vol. I: The Nineteenth Century, pp. 323–325, citing Vincent Corasso, ''The Morgans''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon taking office, Cleveland dealt directly with the Treasury crisis&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/grovercleveland24 Grover Cleveland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918164651/http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/grovercleveland24 |date=2010-09-18 }}," whitehouse.gov&lt;/ref&gt; and successfully convinced [[United States Congress|Congress]] to repeal the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]], which he felt was mainly responsible for the economic crisis.&lt;ref name="Cleveland"&gt;"[http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/cleveland/essays/biography/4 Grover Cleveland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009012123/http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/cleveland/essays/biography/4 |date=2010-10-09 }}," American President: A Reference Resource, millercenter.org&lt;/ref&gt;

As concern for the state of the economy deepened, people rushed to withdraw their money from banks, and caused [[bank run]]s. The [[credit crunch]] rippled through the [[Economy of the United States|economy.]] A [[Financial crisis|financial panic]] in London combined with a drop in continental [[European Trade Union Confederation|European trade]] caused foreign investors to sell American stocks to obtain American funds backed by gold.&lt;ref name="whitten"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/whitten.panic.1893 |title=EH.Net Encyclopedia: Depression of 1893 |publisher=eh.net |accessdate=2009-04-20 |last=Whitten |first=David O. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427161827/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/whitten.panic.1893 |archivedate=2009-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Populists ==

The [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]], also known as the '[[Populism|Populists]]', was an [[agrarianism|agrarian]]-populist political party in the United States. From 1892 to 1896, it played a major role as a left-wing force in American politics. It drew support from angry farmers in the West and South. It was highly critical of capitalism, especially banks and railroads, and allied itself with the labor movement.

Established in 1891 as a result of the Populist movement, the People's Party reached its [[zenith]] in the [[1892 United States presidential election|1892 presidential election]], when its ticket, composed of [[James B. Weaver]] and [[James G. Field]], won 8.5% of the popular vote and carried five states (Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Nevada and North Dakota), and the [[1894 United States House of Representatives elections|1894 House of Representatives elections]], when it won nine seats. Built on a [[coalition]] of poor, white cotton farmers in the South (especially North Carolina, Alabama and Texas) and hard-pressed wheat farmers in the [[Plains States]] (especially Kansas and Nebraska), the Populists represented a radical [[crusading]] form of [[agrarianism]] and hostility to elites, cities, banks, railroads, and gold.

The [[Free Silver]] movement arose from a [[synergy]] of farming and mining interests. Farmers sought to invigorate the economy and thereby end [[deflation]], which was forcing them to repay loans with increasingly valuable dollars.  Mining interests sought the right to turn silver directly into money without a central minting institution. The [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] of 1890, while falling short of the Free Silver movement's goals, required the U.S. government to buy millions of ounces of silver above what was required by the [[Bland–Allison Act|1878 Bland–Allison Act]] (driving up the price of silver and pleasing silver miners). People attempted to redeem [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver notes]] for gold. Ultimately, the statutory limit for the minimum amount of gold in federal reserves was reached and U.S. notes could no longer be successfully redeemed for gold.&lt;ref name="whitten"/&gt; Investments during the time of the panic were heavily financed through bond issues with high interest payments.  Rumors regarding the [[National Cordage Company]] (NCC)'s financial distress (NCC was the most actively traded stock at the time) caused its lenders to call in their loans immediately, and the company went into bankruptcy [[Bankruptcy|receivership]] as a result. The company, a rope manufacturer, had tried to corner the market for imported hemp. As demand for silver and silver notes fell, the price and value of silver dropped. Holders worried about a loss of face value of bonds, and many became worthless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Cynthia Clark|last=Northrup|title=The American Economy: Essays and primary source documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3DE4P7NdaycC&amp;pg=PA195|year=2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=195|isbn=9781576078662}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of bank failures followed, and the [[Northern Pacific Railway]], the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] and the [[Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railroad]] failed. This was followed by the bankruptcy of many other companies; in total over 15,000 companies and 500 banks, many of them in the [[West]], failed. According to high estimates, about {{nowrap|17%–19%}} of the workforce was unemployed at the panic's peak.  The huge spike in unemployment, combined with the loss of life savings kept in failed banks, meant that a once-secure middle-class could not meet their [[mortgage]] obligations. Many walked away from recently built homes as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Charles. ''The Depression of the Nineties: An Economic History''. Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing, 1970. p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
[[Image:War of wealth bank run poster.jpg|thumb|The 1896 Broadway melodrama ''The War of Wealth'' was inspired by the panic of 1893.]]

As a result of the panic, [[Share price|stock prices]] declined. Five hundred banks closed, 15,000 businesses failed, and numerous farms ceased operation. The unemployment rate hit 25% in Pennsylvania, 35% in New York, and 43% in Michigan. [[Soup kitchen]]s were opened to help feed the destitute. Facing starvation, people chopped wood, broke rocks, and sewed by hand with needle and thread in exchange for food. In some cases, women resorted to prostitution to feed their families. To help the people of Detroit, [[Hazen S. Pingree|Mayor Hazen S. Pingree]] launched his "Potato Patch Plan", which were community gardens for farming.&lt;ref&gt;Parshall, Gerald. "The Great Panic Of '93." U.S. News &amp; World Report 113.17 (1992): 70. Academic Search Complete. Web. 26 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Grover Cleveland]] was blamed for the depression. Gold reserves stored in the [[U.S. Treasury]] fell to a dangerously low level. This forced President Cleveland to borrow $65 million in gold from Wall Street banker [[J.P. Morgan]] and the [[Rothschild banking family of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Harold U. |last=Faulkner |title=Politics Reform and Expansion: 1890–1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_O2g_mDaYu8C|year=1959|pages=143–44, 155–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; His party suffered enormous losses in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1894|1894 elections]], largely being blamed for the downward spiral in the economy and the brutal crushing of the [[Pullman Strike]]. After their defeat in 1896, the Democrats did not regain control of any branch of the Federal Government until [[1910 United States elections|1910]].

===Shipping===
[[File:Grand Central Depot 1890s crop.jpg|thumb|The [[Grand Central Depot]] was an important hub for [[rail transportation]], a major part of the [[shipping industry]] in the late nineteenth century]]
The Panic of 1893 affected many aspects of the [[shipping industry]], both by [[rail transportation|rail]] and by sea. It arrested the acquisition of ships and rolling stock, and pushed down shipping rates.

====Fluctuations in railroad investment after the Panic of 1893====
The bad omen of investors switching from potentially volatile [[stock]]s to more stable [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] in 1894 was mirrored in railroads by slower acquisition of [[rolling stock]]. Railroad expansion rose again in 1895, but was arrested in 1897 by another economic trough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=Charles|date=1956|title=The Depression of the Nineties|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=16|issue=2|pages=137–164|jstor=2114113|doi=10.1017/S0022050700058629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Receivership====
In 1893, the total railroad mileage in the U.S. was 176,803.6 miles. In 1894 and 1895, railroads only expanded 4,196.4 miles, although 100,000 miles of rail was added from 1878 to 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Annual report of the Interstate Commerce Commission. 1896.|language=en|hdl = 2027/uc1.$b796977}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, the year following the panic, one fourth of all rail mileage went into receivership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leonard|first=W. N.|date=1949|title=The Decline of Railroad Consolidation|journal=The Journal of Economic History|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–24|jstor=2113718|doi=10.1017/S0022050700090306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Census]] placed this value at close to $1.8 billion (not adjusted for inflation), the largest amount recorded between 1876 and 1910. This was over $1 billion (also not adjusted for inflation) more than the next largest amount, in 1884.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1911/compendia/statab/33ed/1910-05.pdf|title=Internal Communication and Transportation|date=30 Mar 2015|website=United States Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pullman Strike====
In 1894, the U.S. Army intervened during a strike in Chicago to prevent property damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rondinone|first=Troy|date=2009|title=Guarding the Switch: Cultivating Nationalism during the Pullman Strike|journal=The Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era|volume=8|issue=1|pages=83–109|jstor=40542737|doi=10.1017/S1537781400001018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pullman Strike|The strike]] was instigated at the [[Pullman Company]] in [[Chicago]] after it refused to either lower rent in the company town or raise wages for its workers due to increased economic pressure from the Panic of 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/fromcottagetobun00jose|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/fromcottagetobun00jose/page/93 93]|title=From Cottage to Bungalow: Houses and the Working Class in Metropolitan Chicago, 1869-1929|last=Bigott|first=Joseph C.|date=2001-08-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226048758|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Pullman Company was a [[railroad car]] company, this only increased the difficulty of acquiring rolling stock.

====American merchant tonnage====
The maritime industry of the United States did not escape the effects of the Panic of 1893. The total gross registered merchant marine tonnage employed in "foreign and coastwise trade and in the fisheries", as measured by the U.S. Census between 1888 and 1893, grew at a rate of about 2.74%. In 1894, however, U.S. gross tonnage decreased by 2.9%, and again in 1895 by 1.03%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1911/compendia/statab/33ed/1910-06.pdf|title=Merchant Marine and Shipping|date=30 Mar 2015|website=United States Census Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rates====
In 1894, the rate for a [[bushel]] of wheat by rail dropped from 14.7¢ in 1893 to 12.88¢. This rate continued to decrease, reaching a terminal rate in 1901 of 9.92¢ and never reached 12 cents between 1898 and 1910.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Between 1893 and 1894, average shipping rates by lake or canal per wheat bushel decreased by almost 2 cents, from 6.33¢ to 4.44¢. Rates on the transatlantic crossing from [[New York City]] to [[Liverpool]] also decreased, from 2 and 3/8 to 1 and 15/16, but this reflected a trend downward since 1891.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
