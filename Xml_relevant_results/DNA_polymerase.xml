'''DNA polymerase''' is an [[enzyme]] that synthesizes [[DNA]] [[molecule]]s from [[deoxyribonucleotide]]s, the building blocks of DNA. These enzymes are essential for [[DNA replication]] and usually work in pairs to create two identical DNA strands from a single original DNA molecule. During this process, DNA polymerase "reads" the existing DNA strands to create two new strands that match the existing ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bollum FJ | title = Calf thymus polymerase | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 235 | pages = 2399–403 | date = August 1960 | pmid = 13802334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Falaschi A, Kornberg A | title = Biochemical studies of bacterial sporulation.

These enzymes [[catalysis|catalyze]] the [[chemical reaction]]

: [[deoxynucleoside]] triphosphate + DNA&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;  {{eqm}} [[diphosphate]] + DNA&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;.

DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the [[Directionality (molecular biology)|three prime (3')]]-end of a DNA strand, one nucleotide at a time.
Every time a [[Cell division|cell divides]], DNA polymerases are required to help duplicate the cell's DNA, so that a copy of the original DNA molecule can be passed to each daughter cell. In this way, genetic information is passed down from generation to generation.

Before replication can take place, an enzyme called [[helicase]] unwinds the DNA molecule from its tightly woven form, in the process breaking the [[hydrogen bond]]s between the [[base pair|nucleotide bases]]. This opens up or "unzips" the double-stranded DNA to give two single strands of DNA that can be used as templates for replication.

==History==
In 1956, [[Arthur Kornberg]] and colleagues discovered [[DNA polymerase I]] (Pol I), in ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. They described the DNA replication process by which DNA polymerase copies the base sequence of a template DNA strand. Kornberg was later awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1959 for this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1959 | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1959/ | publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] | access-date=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA polymerase II]] was also discovered by [[Thomas B. Kornberg|Thomas Kornberg]] (the son of [[Arthur Kornberg]]) and Malcolm E. Gefter in 1970 while further elucidating the role of Pol I in ''E. coli'' DNA replication.&lt;ref name="pmid7908652"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tessman I, Kennedy MA | title = DNA polymerase II of Escherichia coli in the bypass of abasic sites in vivo | journal = Genetics | volume = 136 | issue = 2 | pages = 439–48 | date = February 1994 | pmid = 7908652 | pmc = 1205799 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
[[File:Replication fork.svg|thumb|DNA polymerase moves along the old strand in the 3'–5' direction, creating a new strand having a 5'–3' direction.]]
[[File:DNA polymerase.svg|thumb|200px|right|DNA polymerase with proofreading ability]]
The main function of DNA polymerase is to synthesize DNA from [[deoxyribonucleotide]]s, the building blocks of DNA. The DNA copies are created by the pairing of nucleotides to bases present on each strand of the original DNA molecule. This pairing always occurs in specific combinations, with [[cytosine]] along with [[guanine]], and [[thymine]] along with [[adenine]], forming two separate pairs, respectively. By contrast, [[RNA polymerase]]s synthesize RNA from [[ribonucleotide]]s from either RNA or DNA.

When synthesizing new DNA, DNA polymerase can add free nucleotides only to the [[directionality (molecular biology)|3' end]] of the newly forming strand. This results in elongation of the newly forming strand in a 5'–3' direction. No known DNA polymerase is able to begin a new chain (''de novo''); it can only add a nucleotide onto a pre-existing 3'-[[hydroxide|OH group]], and therefore needs a [[primer (molecular biology)|primer]] at which it can add the first nucleotide. Primers consist of [[RNA]] or DNA bases (or both). In DNA replication, the first two bases are always RNA, and are synthesized by another enzyme called [[primase]]. [[Helicase]] and [[topoisomerase II]] are required to unwind DNA from a double-strand structure to a single-strand structure to facilitate replication of each strand consistent with the [[semiconservative]] model of DNA replication.

It is important to note that the directionality of the newly forming strand (the daughter strand) is opposite to the direction in which DNA polymerase moves along the template strand. Since DNA polymerase requires a free 3' OH group for initiation of synthesis, it can synthesize in only one direction by extending the 3' end of the preexisting nucleotide chain. Hence, DNA polymerase moves along the template strand in a 3'–5' direction, and the daughter strand is formed in a 5'–3' direction.  This difference enables the resultant double-strand DNA formed to be composed of two DNA strands that are [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]] to each other.

The function of DNA polymerase is not quite perfect, with the enzyme making about one mistake for every billion base pairs copied. Error correction is a property of some, but not all DNA polymerases. This process corrects mistakes in newly synthesized DNA. When an incorrect base pair is recognized, DNA polymerase moves backwards by one base pair of DNA. The 3'–5' [[exonuclease]] activity of the enzyme allows the incorrect base pair to be excised (this activity is known as ''[[proofreading (biology)|proofreading]]''). Following base excision, the polymerase can re-insert the correct base and replication can continue forwards. This preserves the integrity of the original DNA strand that is passed onto the daughter cells.

Fidelity is very important in DNA replication. Mismatches in DNA base pairing can potentially result in dysfunctional [[protein]]s and could lead to cancer. Many DNA polymerases contain an exonuclease domain, which acts in detecting base pair mismatches and further performs in the removal of the incorrect nucleotide to be replaced by the correct one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biochemistry|last=Garrett, Grisham|publisher=Mary Finch|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shape and the interactions accommodating the Watson and Crick base pair are what primarily contribute to the detection or error. Hydrogen bonds play a key role in base pair binding and interaction. The loss of an interaction, which occurs at a mismatch, is said to trigger a shift in the balance, for the binding of the template-primer, from the polymerase, to the exonuclease domain. In addition, an incorporation of a wrong nucleotide causes a retard in DNA polymerization. This delay gives time for the DNA to be switched from the polymerase site to the exonuclease site. Different conformational changes and loss of interaction occur at different mismatches. In a purine:pyrimidine mismatch there is a displacement of the pyrimidine towards the major groove and the purine towards the minor groove. Relative to the shape of DNA polymerase's binding pocket, steric clashes occur between the purine and residues in the minor groove, and important [[van der Waals force|van der Waals]] and electrostatic interactions are lost by the pyrimidine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hunter WN, Brown T, Anand NN, Kennard O | title = Structure of an adenine-cytosine base pair in DNA and its implications for mismatch repair | journal = Nature | volume = 320 | issue = 6062 | pages = 552–5 | date = 1986 | pmid = 3960137 | doi = 10.1038/320552a0 | access-date =  | bibcode = 1986Natur.320..552H | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c75cda09c2c446f081b81f3653924fdcf0e81196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrimidine:pyrimidine and purine:purine mismatches present less notable changes since the bases are displaced towards the major groove, and less steric hindrance is experienced. However, although the different mismatches result in different steric properties, DNA polymerase is still able to detect and differentiate them so uniformly and maintain fidelity in DNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swan MK, Johnson RE, Prakash L, Prakash S, Aggarwal AK | title = Structural basis of high-fidelity DNA synthesis by yeast DNA polymerase delta | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = 979–86 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19718023 | pmc = 3055789 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.1663 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA polymerization is also critical for many mutagenesis processes and is widely employed in biotechnologies.

=== Structure ===
The known DNA polymerases have highly conserved structure, which means that their overall catalytic [[Protein subunit|subunit]]s vary very little from species to species, independent of their domain structures. Conserved structures usually indicate important, irreplaceable functions of the cell, the maintenance of which provides evolutionary advantages. The shape can be described as resembling a right hand with thumb, finger, and palm domains. The palm domain appears to function in catalyzing the transfer of [[phosphoryl|phosphoryl group]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in the phosphoryl transfer reaction. DNA is bound to the palm when the enzyme is active. This reaction is believed to be catalyzed by a two-metal-ion mechanism. The finger domain functions to bind the [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s with the template base.  The thumb domain plays a potential role in the processivity, translocation, and positioning of the DNA.&lt;ref name="pmid10364165"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Steitz TA | title = DNA polymerases: structural diversity and common mechanisms | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 274 | issue = 25 | pages = 17395–8 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10364165 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.274.25.17395 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Processivity===
DNA polymerase's rapid catalysis is due to its processive nature. [[Processivity]] is a characteristic of enzymes that function on polymeric substrates. In the case of DNA polymerase, the degree of processivity refers to the average number of nucleotides added each time the enzyme binds a template. The average DNA polymerase requires about one second locating and binding a primer/template junction. Once it is bound, a nonprocessive DNA polymerase adds [[nucleotide]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s at a rate of one nucleotide per second.&lt;ref name="Losick_2008"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Losick R, Watson JD, Baker TA, Bell S, Gann A, Levine MW | title = Molecular biology of the gene | publisher = Pearson/Benjamin Cummings | location = San Francisco | year = 2008 | pages = | isbn = 978-0-8053-9592-1  | edition = 6th }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|207–208}} Processive DNA polymerases, however, add multiple nucleotides per second, drastically increasing the rate of DNA synthesis. The degree of processivity is directly proportional to the rate of DNA synthesis. The rate of DNA synthesis in a living cell was first determined as the rate of phage T4 DNA elongation in phage infected ''E. coli''.  During the period of exponential DNA increase at 37&amp;nbsp;°C, the rate was 749 nucleotides per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCarthy D, Minner C, Bernstein H, Bernstein C | title = DNA elongation rates and growing point distributions of wild-type phage T4 and a DNA-delay amber mutant | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 106 | issue = 4 | pages = 963–81 | date = October 1976 | pmid = 789903 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(76)90346-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA polymerase's ability to slide along the DNA template allows increased processivity. There is a dramatic increase in processivity at the [[DNA replication#Replication fork|replication fork]]. This increase is facilitated by the DNA polymerase's association with proteins known as the sliding [[DNA clamp]]. The clamps are multiple protein subunits associated in the shape of a ring. Using the [[hydrolysis]] of ATP, a class of proteins known as the [[Replication factor C|sliding clamp loading proteins]] open up the ring structure of the sliding DNA clamps allowing binding to and release from the DNA strand. [[Protein-protein interaction]] with the clamp prevents DNA polymerase from diffusing from the DNA template, thereby ensuring that the enzyme binds the same primer/template junction and continues replication.&lt;ref name="Losick_2008"/&gt;{{rp|207–208}} DNA polymerase changes conformation, increasing affinity to the clamp when associated with it and decreasing affinity when it completes the replication of a stretch of DNA to allow release from the clamp.

Based on sequence homology, DNA polymerases can be further subdivided into seven different families: A, B, C, D, X, Y, and RT.

Some [[virus]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;es also encode special DNA polymerases, such as [[Hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase]]. These may selectively replicate viral DNA through a variety of mechanisms. [[Retroviruses]] encode an unusual DNA polymerase called [[reverse transcriptase]], which is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp). It polymerizes DNA from a template of [[RNA]].

===Prokaryotic polymerase===
Prokaryotic polymerases exist in two forms: core polymerase and holoenzyme. Core polymerase synthesizes DNA from the DNA template but it cannot initiate the synthesis alone or accurately. Holoenzyme accurately initiates synthesis.

====Pol I====
Prokaryotic family A polymerases include the [[DNA polymerase I]] (Pol I) enzyme, which is encoded by the ''polA'' [[gene]] and ubiquitous among [[prokaryotes]]. This repair polymerase is involved in excision repair with both 3'–5' and 5'–3' exonuclease activity and processing of [[Okazaki fragment]]s generated during lagging strand synthesis.&lt;ref name="isbn981-4299-16-2"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors = Maga G, Hubscher U, Spadari S, Villani G | title = DNA Polymerases: Discovery, Characterization Functions in Cellular DNA Transactions | publisher = World Scientific Publishing Company | location = | year = 2010 | pages = | isbn = 978-981-4299-16-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pol I is the most abundant polymerase, accounting for &gt;95% of polymerase activity in ''E. coli''; yet cells lacking Pol I have been found suggesting Pol I activity can be replaced by the other four polymerases.  Pol I adds ~15-20 nucleotides per second, thus showing poor processivity.  Instead, Pol I starts adding nucleotides at the RNA primer:template junction known as the [[origin of replication]] (ori).  Approximately 400 bp downstream from the origin, the Pol III holoenzyme is assembled and takes over replication at a highly processive speed and nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Choi CH, Burton ZF, Usheva A|date=February 2004|title=Auto-acetylation of transcription factors as a control mechanism in gene expression|journal=Cell Cycle|volume=3|issue=2|pages=114–5|doi=10.4161/cc.3.2.651|pmid=14712067|doi-access=free}}&lt;!--|access-date=7 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taq polymerase|''Taq'' polymerase]] is a heat-stable enzyme of this family that lacks proofreading ability.&lt;ref name="Chien et al."&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chien A, Edgar DB, Trela JM | title = Deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase from the extreme thermophile Thermus aquaticus | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 127 | issue = 3 | pages = 1550–7 | date = September 1976 | pmid = 8432 | pmc = 232952 | doi = 10.1128/JB.127.3.1550-1557.1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pol II====
[[DNA polymerase II]] is a family B polymerase encoded by the polB gene.  Pol II has 3'–5' exonuclease activity and participates in [[DNA repair]], replication restart to bypass lesions, and its cell presence can jump from ~30-50 copies per cell to ~200–300 during SOS induction.  Pol II is also thought to be a backup to Pol III as it can interact with holoenzyme proteins and assume a high level of processivity.  The main role of Pol II is thought to be the ability to direct polymerase activity at the replication fork and helped stalled Pol III bypass terminal mismatches.&lt;ref name="banach"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Banach-Orlowska M, Fijalkowska IJ, Schaaper RM, Jonczyk P|date=October 2005|title=DNA polymerase II as a fidelity factor in chromosomal DNA synthesis in Escherichia coli|journal=Molecular Microbiology|volume=58|issue=1|pages=61–70|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04805.x|pmid=16164549}}&lt;!--|access-date=7 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pol III====
[[DNA polymerase III]] holoenzyme is the primary enzyme involved in DNA replication in ''E. coli'' and belongs to family C polymerases. It consists of three assemblies: the pol III core, the beta [[DNA clamp|sliding clamp]] processivity factor, and the clamp-loading complex. The core consists of three subunits: α, the polymerase activity hub, ɛ, exonucleolytic proofreader, and θ, which may act as a stabilizer for ɛ.  The beta sliding clamp processivity factor is also present in duplicate, one for each core, to create a clamp that encloses DNA allowing for high processivity.&lt;ref name="pmid7494000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olson MW, Dallmann HG, McHenry CS | title = DnaX complex of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III holoenzyme.

Recent research has classified Family C polymerases as a subcategory of Family X with no eukaryotic equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/DNA-Polymerase-Families.aspx |title=DNA Polymerase Families |publisher=News-medical.net |date=2014-05-06 |access-date=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2019}}

The old textbook "trombone model" depicts an elongation complex with two equivalents of the core enzyme at each replication fork (RF), one for each strand, the lagging and leading.&lt;ref name="banach" /&gt; However, recent evidence from single-molecule studies indicates an average of three stoichiometric equivalents of core enzyme at each RF for both Pol III and its counterpart in ''B. subtilis,'' PolC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liao Y, Li Y, Schroeder JW, Simmons LA, Biteen JS | title = Single-Molecule DNA Polymerase Dynamics at a Bacterial Replisome in Live Cells | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 111 | issue = 12 | pages = 2562–2569 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 28002733 | doi = 10.1016/j.bpj.2016.11.006 | pmc = 5192695 | bibcode = 2016BpJ...111.2562L }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In-cell fluorescent microscopy has revealed that leading strand synthesis may not be completely continuous, and Pol III* (i.e., the holoenzyme α, ε, τ, δ and χ subunits without the ß2 sliding clamp) has a high frequency of dissociation from active RFs.&lt;ref name = "smas"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu ZQ, Dixon NE | title = Bacterial replisomes | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 53 | pages = 159–168 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30292863 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2018.09.006 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these studies, the replication fork turnover rate was about 10s for Pol III*, 47s for the ß2 sliding clamp, and 15m for the DnaB helicase. This suggests that the DnaB helicase may remain stably associated at RFs and serve as a nucleation point for the competent holoenzyme.  ''In vitro'' single-molecule studies have shown that Pol III* has a high rate of RF turnover when in excess, but remains stably associated with replication forks when concentration is limiting.&lt;ref name="smas" /&gt;  Another single-molecule study showed that DnaB helicase activity and strand elongation can proceed with decoupled, stochastic kinetics.&lt;ref name="smas" /&gt;

====Pol IV====
In ''E. coli'', [[DNA polymerase IV]] (Pol IV) is an error-prone DNA polymerase involved in non-targeted mutagenesis.&lt;ref name="pmid12045089"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodman MF | title = Error-prone repair DNA polymerases in prokaryotes and eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 71 | issue =  | pages = 17–50 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12045089 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.083101.124707 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/2e41144b08ed6b467d246d84b1566933e442ffc8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pol IV is a Family Y polymerase expressed by the dinB gene that is switched on via SOS induction caused by stalled polymerases at the replication fork.  During SOS induction, Pol IV production is increased tenfold and one of the functions during this time is to interfere with Pol III holoenzyme processivity.  This creates a checkpoint, stops replication, and allows time to repair DNA lesions via the appropriate repair pathway.&lt;ref name="pmid22820381"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mori T, Nakamura T, Okazaki N, Furukohri A, Maki H, Akiyama MT | title = Escherichia coli DinB inhibits replication fork progression without significantly inducing the SOS response | journal = Genes &amp; Genetic Systems | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 75–87 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22820381 | doi = 10.1266/ggs.87.75 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another function of Pol IV is to perform [[DNA repair|translesion synthesis]] at the stalled replication fork like, for example, bypassing N2-deoxyguanine adducts at a faster rate than transversing undamaged DNA.  Cells lacking dinB gene have a higher rate of mutagenesis caused by DNA damaging agents.&lt;ref name="pmid17377496"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jarosz DF, Godoy VG, Walker GC | title = Proficient and accurate bypass of persistent DNA lesions by DinB DNA polymerases | journal = Cell Cycle | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 817–22 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17377496 | doi = 10.4161/cc.6.7.4065 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pol V====
[[DNA polymerase V]] (Pol V) is a Y-family DNA polymerase that is involved in [[SOS response]] and [[translesion synthesis]] DNA repair mechanisms.&lt;ref name="pmid20441441"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Patel M, Jiang Q, Woodgate R, Cox MM, Goodman MF | title = A new model for SOS-induced mutagenesis: how RecA protein activates DNA polymerase V | journal = Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 171–84 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20441441 | pmc = 2874081 | doi = 10.3109/10409238.2010.480968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transcription of Pol V via the umuDC genes is highly regulated to produce only Pol V when damaged DNA is present in the cell generating an SOS response. Stalled polymerases causes RecA to bind to the ssDNA, which causes the LexA protein to autodigest. LexA then loses its ability to repress the transcription of the umuDC operon. The same RecA-ssDNA nucleoprotein posttranslationally modifies the UmuD protein into UmuD' protein. UmuD and UmuD' form a heterodimer that interacts with UmuC, which in turn activates umuC's polymerase catalytic activity on damaged DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sutton MD, Walker GC | title = Managing DNA polymerases: coordinating DNA replication, DNA repair, and DNA recombination | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 98 | issue = 15 | pages = 8342–9 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11459973 | pmc = 37441 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.111036998 | bibcode = 2001PNAS...98.8342S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In E. coli, a polymerase “tool belt” model for switching pol III with pol IV at a stalled replication fork, where both polymerases bind simultaneously to the β-clamp, has been proposed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raychaudhury P, Basu AK | title = Genetic requirement for mutagenesis of the G[8,5-Me]T cross-link in Escherichia coli: DNA polymerases IV and V compete for error-prone bypass | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 12 | pages = 2330–8 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21302943 | pmc = 3062377 | doi = 10.1021/bi102064z }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the involvement of more than one TLS polymerase working in succession to bypass a lesion has not yet been shown in E. coli. Moreover, Pol IV can catalyze both insertion and extension with high efficiency, whereas pol V is considered the major SOS TLS polymerase. One example is the bypass of intra strand guanine thymine cross-link where it was shown on the basis of the difference in the mutational signatures of the two polymerases, that pol IV and pol V compete for TLS of the intra-strand crosslink.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Family D====
In 1998, the family D of DNA polymerase was discovered in ''[[Pyrococcus furiosus]]'' and ''[[Methanococcus jannaschii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishino Y, Komori K, Cann IK, Koga Y | title = A novel DNA polymerase family found in Archaea | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 180 | issue = 8 | pages = 2232–6 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9555910 | pmc = 107154 | doi = 10.1128/JB.180.8.2232-2236.1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PolD complex is a heterodimer of two chains, each encoded by DP1 (small proofreading) and DP2 (large catalytic). Unlike other DNA polymerases, the structure and mechanism of the catalytic core resemble that of multi-subunit [[RNA polymerase]]s.

===Eukaryotic DNA polymerase===

====Polymerases β, λ, σ, μ (beta, lambda, sigma, mu) and TdT====
Family X polymerases contain the well-known eukaryotic polymerase [[DNA polymerase beta|pol β (beta)]], as well as other eukaryotic polymerases such as Pol σ (sigma), [[DNA polymerase lambda|Pol λ (lambda)]], [[DNA polymerase mu|Pol μ (mu)]], and [[terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase|Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)]].  Family X polymerases are found mainly in vertebrates, and a few are found in plants and fungi.  These polymerases have highly conserved regions that include two helix-hairpin-helix motifs that are imperative in the DNA-polymerase interactions. One motif is located in the 8 kDa domain that interacts with downstream DNA and one motif is located in the thumb domain that interacts with the primer strand.  Pol β, encoded by POLB gene, is required for short-patch [[base excision repair]], a DNA repair pathway that is essential for repairing alkylated or oxidized bases as well as [[abasic site]]s.  Pol λ and Pol μ, encoded by the [[POLL]] and [[POLM]] genes respectively, are involved in [[non-homologous end-joining]], a mechanism for rejoining DNA double-strand breaks due to hydrogen peroxide and ionizing radiation, respectively.  TdT is expressed only in lymphoid tissue, and adds "n nucleotides" to double-strand breaks formed during [[V(D)J recombination]] to promote immunological diversity.&lt;ref name="pmid19631767"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamtich J, Sweasy JB | title = DNA polymerase family X: function, structure, and cellular roles | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1804 | issue = 5 | pages = 1136–50 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 19631767 | pmc = 2846199 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbapap.2009.07.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polymerases α, δ and ε (alpha, delta, and epsilon)====
[[DNA polymerase alpha|Pol α (alpha)]], [[DNA polymerase delta|Pol δ (delta)]], and [[DNA polymerase epsilon|Pol ε (epsilon)]] are members of Family B Polymerases and are the main polymerases involved with nuclear DNA replication.  Pol α complex (pol α-DNA primase complex) consists of four subunits: the catalytic subunit [[POLA1]], the regulatory subunit [[POLA2]], and the small and the large primase subunits [[PRIM1]] and [[PRIM2]] respectively. Once primase has created the RNA primer, Pol α starts replication elongating the primer with ~20 nucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|  last1 = Chansky | first1 =Michael Lieberman | first2 = Allan | last2 = Marks | first3 = Alisa | last3 = Peet | name-list-format = vanc | title = Marks' Basic Medical Biochemistry: a clinical approach|year=2012|publisher=Wolter Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1608315727|page=chapter13|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its high processivity, Pol δ takes over the leading and lagging strand synthesis from Pol α.&lt;ref name="Losick_2008" /&gt;{{rp|218–219}} Pol δ is expressed by genes [[POLD1]], creating the catalytic subunit, [[POLD2]], [[POLD3]], and [[POLD4]] creating the other subunits that interact with [[Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen]] (PCNA), which is a [[DNA clamp]] that allows Pol δ to possess processivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chung DW, Zhang JA, Tan CK, Davie EW, So AG, Downey KM | title = Primary structure of the catalytic subunit of human DNA polymerase delta and chromosomal location of the gene | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 88 | issue = 24 | pages = 11197–201 | date = December 1991 | pmid = 1722322 | pmc = 53101 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.88.24.11197 | bibcode = 1991PNAS...8811197C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pol ε is encoded by the [[POLE1]], the catalytic subunit, [[POLE2]], and [[POLE3]] gene.

Compared to other Family B polymerases, the DEDD exonuclease family responsible for proofreading is inactivated in Pol α.&lt;ref name="pmid25101062"/&gt; Pol ε is unique in that it has two zinc finger domains and an inactive copy of another family B polymerase in its C-terminal.

====Polymerases η, ι and κ (eta, iota, and kappa)====
[[DNA polymerase eta|Pol η (eta)]], Pol ι (iota), and Pol κ (kappa), are Family Y DNA polymerases involved in the DNA repair by translesion synthesis and encoded by genes POLH, [[POLI]], and [[POLK]] respectively. Members of Family Y have five common motifs to aid in binding the substrate and primer terminus and they all include the typical right hand thumb, palm and finger domains with added domains like little finger (LF), polymerase-associated domain (PAD), or wrist. The active site, however, differs between family members due to the different lesions being repaired. Polymerases in Family Y are low-fidelity polymerases, but have been proven to do more good than harm as mutations that affect the polymerase can cause various diseases, such as [[skin cancer]] and [[Xeroderma pigmentosum|Xeroderma Pigmentosum Variant (XPS).]] The importance of these polymerases is evidenced by the fact that gene encoding DNA polymerase η is referred as XPV, because loss of this gene results in the disease Xeroderma Pigmentosum Variant. Pol η is particularly important for allowing accurate translesion synthesis of DNA damage resulting from [[ultraviolet radiation]]. The functionality of Pol κ is not completely understood, but researchers have found two probable functions. Pol κ is thought to act as an extender or an inserter of a specific base at certain DNA lesions.  All three translesion synthesis polymerases, along with Rev1, are recruited to damaged lesions via stalled replicative DNA polymerases. There are two pathways of damage repair leading researchers to conclude that the chosen pathway depends on which strand contains the damage, the leading or lagging strand.&lt;ref name="pmid20663485"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ohmori H, Hanafusa T, Ohashi E, Vaziri C | title = Separate roles of structured and unstructured regions of Y-family DNA polymerases | volume = 78 | pages = 99–146 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20663485 | pmc = 3103052 | doi = 10.1016/S1876-1623(08)78004-0 | isbn = 9780123748270 | series = Advances in Protein Chemistry and Structural Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polymerases Rev1 and ζ (zeta)====
Pol ζ another B family polymerase, is made of two subunits [[REV3L|Rev3]], the catalytic subunit, and Rev7 ([[MAD2L2]]), which increases the catalytic function of the polymerase, and is involved in translesion synthesis. Pol ζ lacks 3' to 5' exonuclease activity, is unique in that it can extend primers with terminal mismatches. [[REV1|Rev1]] has three regions of interest in the BRCT domain, ubiquitin-binding domain, and C-terminal domain and has dCMP transferase ability, which adds deoxycytidine opposite lesions that would stall replicative polymerases Pol δ and Pol ε.  These stalled polymerases activate ubiquitin complexes that in turn disassociate replication polymerases and recruit Pol ζ and Rev1. Together Pol ζ and Rev1 add deoxycytidine and Pol ζ extends past the lesion. Through a yet undetermined process, Pol ζ disassociates and replication polymerases reassociate and continue replication.  Pol ζ and Rev1 are not required for replication, but loss of REV3 gene in budding yeast can cause increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents due to collapse of replication forks where replication polymerases have stalled.&lt;ref name="pmid18157155"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gan GN, Wittschieben JP, Wittschieben BØ, Wood RD | title = DNA polymerase zeta (pol zeta) in higher eukaryotes | journal = Cell Research | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 174–83 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18157155 | doi = 10.1038/cr.2007.117 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Telomerase====
[[Telomerase]] is a [[ribonucleoprotein]] which functions to replicate ends of linear chromosomes since normal DNA polymerase cannot replicate the ends, or [[telomeres]].  The single-strand 3' overhang of the double-strand chromosome with the sequence 5'-TTAGGG-3' recruits telomerase. Telomerase acts like other DNA polymerases by extending the 3' end, but, unlike other DNA polymerases, telomerase does not require a template. The TERT subunit, an example of a [[reverse transcriptase]], uses the RNA subunit to form the primer–template junction that allows telomerase to extend the 3' end of chromosome ends. The gradual decrease in size of telomeres as the result of many replications over a lifetime are thought to be associated with the effects of aging.&lt;ref name="Losick_2008"/&gt;{{rp|248–249}}

====Polymerases γ, θ and ν (gamma, theta and nu)====
{{further|DNA polymerase nu}}
Pol γ (gamma), Pol θ (theta), and Pol ν (nu) are Family A polymerases. Pol γ, encoded by the [[POLG]] gene, is the only [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] polymerase and therefore replicates, repairs, and has proofreading 3'–5' exonuclease and 5' dRP lyase activities. Any mutation that leads to limited or non-functioning Pol γ has a significant effect on mtDNA and is the most common cause of autosomal inherited mitochondrial disorders.&lt;ref name="pmid21732785"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang L, Chan SS, Wolff DJ | title = Mitochondrial disorders of DNA polymerase γ dysfunction: from anatomic to molecular pathology diagnosis | journal = Archives of Pathology &amp; Laboratory Medicine | volume = 135 | issue = 7 | pages = 925–34 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21732785 | pmc = 3158670 | doi = 10.1043/2010-0356-RAR.1 | doi-broken-date = 2020-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pol γ contains a C-terminus polymerase domain and an N-terminus 3'–5' exonuclease domain that are connected via the linker region, which binds the accessory subunit. The accessory subunit binds DNA and is required for processivity of Pol γ.  Point mutation A467T in the linker region is responsible for more than one-third of all Pol γ-associated mitochondrial disorders.&lt;ref name="pmid20927567"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stumpf JD, Copeland WC | title = Mitochondrial DNA replication and disease: insights from DNA polymerase γ mutations | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 219–33 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20927567 | pmc = 3046768 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-010-0530-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While many homologs of Pol θ, encoded by the [[POLQ]] gene, are found in eukaryotes, its function is not clearly understood.  The sequence of amino acids in the C-terminus is what classifies Pol θ as Family A polymerase, although the error rate for Pol θ is more closely related to Family Y polymerases.  Pol θ extends mismatched primer termini and can bypass abasic sites by adding a nucleotide. It also has Deoxyribophosphodiesterase (dRPase) activity in the polymerase domain and can show [[ATPase]] activity in close proximity to ssDNA.&lt;ref name="pmid22135286"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hogg M, Sauer-Eriksson AE, Johansson E | title = Promiscuous DNA synthesis by human DNA polymerase θ | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 6 | pages = 2611–22 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22135286 | pmc = 3315306 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkr1102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pol ν (nu) is considered to be the least effective of the polymerase enzymes.&lt;ref name=uniprot&gt;{{cite web|title=UniProtKB - Q7Z5Q5 (DPOLN_HUMAN)|publisher=Uniprot|url=https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q7Z5Q5|access-date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, DNA polymerase nu plays an active role in [[homology directed repair|homology repair]] during cellular responses to crosslinks, fulfilling its role in a complex with [[helicase]].&lt;ref name=uniprot /&gt;

Plants use two Family A polymerases to copy both the mitochrondrial and plastid genomes. They are more similar to bacterial Pol I than they are to mamallian Pol γ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cupp JD, Nielsen BL | title = Minireview: DNA replication in plant mitochondria | journal = Mitochondrion | volume = 19 Pt B | pages = 231–7 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 24681310 | pmc = 417701 | doi = 10.1016/j.mito.2014.03.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reverse transcriptase====
Retroviruses encode an unusual DNA polymerase called [[reverse transcriptase]], which is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RdDp) that synthesizes DNA from a template of RNA. The reverse transcriptase family contain both DNA polymerase functionality and RNase H functionality, which degrades RNA base-paired to DNA.  An example of a retrovirus is [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="Losick_2008"/&gt;{{rp|}}
