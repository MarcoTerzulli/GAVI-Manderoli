'''DNA vaccination''' is a technique for protecting against disease by injection with [[genetically engineered]] [[plasmid]] containing the [[DNA]] sequence encoding the antigen(s) against which an immune response is sought so cells directly produce an [[antibody]], producing a protective [[immunological response]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/dna/en/ | title = DNA vaccines }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA vaccines have potential advantages over conventional vaccines, including the ability to induce a wider range of immune response types.

Several DNA vaccines are available for [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary]] use. Currently no DNA vaccines have been approved for human use. Research is investigating the approach for [[virus|viral]], [[bacterial]] and [[parasitic]] diseases in humans, as well as for several cancers.

== History ==
{{see also|Vaccine#History}}

DNA vaccines are third generation vaccines. They contain DNA that codes for specific proteins (antigens) from a pathogen. The DNA is injected into the body and taken up by cells, whose normal metabolic processes synthesize proteins based on the genetic code in the plasmid that they have taken up. Because these proteins contain regions of amino acid sequences that are characteristic of bacteria or viruses, they are recognized as foreign and when they are processed by the host cells and displayed on their surface, the immune system is alerted, which then triggers immune responses.&lt;ref name="Alarcon1999"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Alarcon JB, Waine GW, McManus DP | volume = 42 | pages = 343–410 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10050276 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-308X(08)60152-9 | isbn = 9780120317424 | series = Advances in Parasitology | title = Advances in Parasitology Volume 42 | chapter = DNA Vaccines: Technology and Application as Anti-parasite and Anti-microbial Agents }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson2000"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Robinson HL, Pertmer TM | title = DNA vaccines for viral infections: basic studies and applications | volume = 55 | pages = 1–74 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11050940 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-3527(00)55001-5 | isbn = 9780120398553 | series = Advances in Virus Research }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, the DNA may be encapsulated in protein to facilitate cell entry. If this [[capsid]] protein is included in the DNA, the resulting vaccine can combine the potency of a live vaccine without reversion risks. In 1983, [[Enzo Paoletti]] and Dennis Panicali at the New York Department of Health devised a strategy to produce [[recombinant DNA]] vaccines by using genetic engineering to transform ordinary [[smallpox vaccine]] into vaccines that may be able to prevent other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = White LO, Gibb E, Newham HC, Richardson MD, Warren RC | title = Comparison of the growth of virulent and attenuated strains of Candida albicans in the kidneys of normal and cortison-treated mice by chitin assay | journal = Mycopathologia | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 173–7 | date = July 1979 |doi=10.1007/bf00470753| pmid = 384256 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They altered the DNA of [[cowpox]] virus by inserting a gene from other viruses (namely [[Herpes simplex virus]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[influenza]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paoletti E, Lipinskas BR, Samsonoff C, Mercer S, Panicali D | title = Construction of live vaccines using genetically engineered poxviruses: biological activity of vaccinia virus recombinants expressing the hepatitis B virus surface antigen and the herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 193–7 | date = January 1984 | pmid = 6320164 | pmc = 344637 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.81.1.193 | bibcode = 1984PNAS...81..193P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US Patent 4722848 - Method for immunizing animals with synthetically modified vaccinia virus&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 a DNA vaccine for the [[Zika virus]] began testing at the [[National Institutes of Health]]. The study was planned to involve up to 120 subjects between 18 and 35. Separately, Inovio Pharmaceuticals and GeneOne Life Science began tests of a different DNA vaccine against Zika in Miami. The NIH vaccine is injected into the upper arm under high pressure. Manufacturing the vaccines in volume remains unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602073/us-government-starts-test-of-zika-vaccine-in-humans/?set=602081|title=The U.S. government has begun testing its first Zika vaccine in humans|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical trials for DNA vaccines to prevent HIV are underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen Y, Wang S, Lu S | title = DNA Immunization for HIV Vaccine Development | journal = Vaccines | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 138–59 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 26344472 | pmc = 4494200 | doi = 10.3390/vaccines2010138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

&lt;!-- This section should be supplemented with the examples given in the rest of the text --&gt;
No DNA vaccines have been approved for human use in the United States. Few experimental trials have evoked a response strong enough to protect against disease and the technique's usefulness remains to be proven in humans. A [[veterinary]] DNA vaccine to protect [[horse]]s from [[West Nile virus]] has been approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Fort Dodge Animal Health Announces Approval of West Nile Virus DNA Vaccine for Horses | date=2005-07-18 | url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-134116417.html | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110516225614/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-134116417.html | url-status =dead | archive-date =2011-05-16 | work =PR Newswire | access-date = 2007-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CDC and Fort Dodge Animal Health Achieve First Licensed DNA Vaccine |date=2005-07-18 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r050718.htm |work=CDC |access-date=2007-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820194311/http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r050718.htm |archive-date=2007-08-20 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plasmid vectors ==

=== Vector design ===

DNA vaccines elicit the best immune response when highly active expression vectors are used. These are [[plasmids]] that usually consist of a strong viral promoter to drive the in vivo [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] of the gene (or [[complementary DNA]]) of interest.&lt;ref name=Mor1995&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mor G, Klinman DM, Shapiro S, Hagiwara E, Sedegah M, Norman JA, Hoffman SL, Steinberg AD | title = Complexity of the cytokine and antibody response elicited by immunizing mice with Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite protein plasmid DNA | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 2039–46 | date = August 1995 | pmid = 7636255 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/155/4/2039 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interferon alfa-2b|Intron A]] may sometimes be included to improve [[mRNA]] stability and hence increase protein expression.&lt;ref name=Leitner1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leitner WW, Seguin MC, Ballou WR, Seitz JP, Schultz AM, Sheehy MJ, Lyon JA | title = Immune responses induced by intramuscular or gene gun injection of protective deoxyribonucleic acid vaccines that express the circumsporozoite protein from Plasmodium berghei malaria parasites | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 159 | issue = 12 | pages = 6112–9 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9550412 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/159/12/6112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plasmids also include a strong [[polyadenylation]]/transcriptional termination signal, such as bovine [[growth hormone]] or rabbit [[beta-globulin]] polyadenylation sequences.&lt;ref name=Alarcon1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Böhm1996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Böhm W, Kuhröber A, Paier T, Mertens T, Reimann J, Schirmbeck R | title = DNA vector constructs that prime hepatitis B surface antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte and antibody responses in mice after intramuscular injection | journal = Journal of Immunological Methods | volume = 193 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–40 | date = June 1996 | pmid = 8690928 | doi = 10.1016/0022-1759(96)00035-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cistron|Polycistronic]] vectors (ones located at multiple genome sites) are sometimes constructed to express more than one immunogen, or to express an immunogen and an immunostimulatory protein.&lt;ref name=Lewis1999&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lewis PJ, Babiuk LA | title = DNA vaccines: a review | journal = Advances in Virus Research | volume = 54 | pages = 129–88 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10547676 | doi = 10.1016/S0065-3527(08)60367-X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lrMc3G9nIpkC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=lewis | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-12-039854-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the plasmid is the “vehicle” from which the immunogen is expressed, optimising vector design for maximal protein expression is essential.&lt;ref name=Lewis1999 /&gt; One way of enhancing protein expression is by optimising the [[codon]] usage of pathogenic mRNAs for [[eukaryotic]] cells. Pathogens often have different [[GC-content|AT-contents]] than the target species, so altering the [[gene sequence]] of the immunogen to reflect the [[genetic code|codon]]s more commonly used in the target species may improve its expression.&lt;ref name=Andre1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = André S, Seed B, Eberle J, Schraut W, Bültmann A, Haas J | title = Increased immune response elicited by DNA vaccination with a synthetic gp120 sequence with optimized codon usage | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 1497–503 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9445053 | pmc = 124631 | url = http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/72/2/1497 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.72.2.1497-1503.1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another consideration is the choice of [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]. The [[SV40]] promoter was conventionally used until research showed that vectors driven by the [[Rous Sarcoma Virus]] (RSV) promoter had much higher expression rates.&lt;ref name=Alarcon1999 /&gt; More recently, expression rates have been further increased by the use of the [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) immediate early promoter. Inclusion of the [[Simian retrovirus|Mason-Pfizer monkey virus]] (MPV)-CTE with/without rev increased envelope expression. Furthermore, the CTE+rev construct was significantly more immunogenic than CTE-alone vector.&lt;ref name=Muthumani1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muthumani K, Zhang D, Dayes NS, Hwang DS, Calarota SA, Choo AY, Boyer JD, Weiner DB | title = Novel engineered HIV-1 East African Clade-A gp160 plasmid construct induces strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in vivo | journal = Virology | volume = 314 | issue = 1 | pages = 134–46 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 14517067 | doi = 10.1016/S0042-6822(03)00459-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional modifications to improve expression rates include the insertion of enhancer sequences, synthetic [[introns]], [[adenovirus]] tripartite leader (TPL) sequences and modifications to the polyadenylation and transcriptional termination sequences.&lt;ref name=Alarcon1999 /&gt; An example of DNA vaccine plasmid is pVAC, which uses SV40 [[promoter (biology)|promoter]].

Structural instability phenomena are of particular concern for plasmid manufacture, DNA vaccination and gene therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oliveira PH, Prather KJ, Prazeres DM, Monteiro GA | title = Structural instability of plasmid biopharmaceuticals: challenges and implications | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 503–11 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19656584 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2009.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accessory regions pertaining to the plasmid backbone may engage in a wide range of structural instability phenomena. Well-known catalysts of genetic instability include direct, inverted and tandem repeats, which are conspicuous in many commercially available cloning and expression vectors. Therefore, the reduction or complete elimination of extraneous noncoding backbone sequences would pointedly reduce the propensity for such events to take place and consequently the overall plasmid's recombinogenic potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oliveira PH, Mairhofer J | title = Marker-free plasmids for biotechnological applications - implications and perspectives | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 31 | issue = 9 | pages = 539–47 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23830144 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2013.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mechanism of plasmids ===
Once the plasmid inserts itself into the transfected cell nucleus, it codes for a peptide string of a foreign antigen. On its surface the cell displays the foreign antigen with both histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes I and class II molecules. The antigen-presenting cell then travels to the lymph nodes and presents the antigen peptide and costimulatory molecule signaled by T-cell, initiating the immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kutzler MA, Weiner DB | title = DNA vaccines: ready for prime time? | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 776–88 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18781156 | pmc = 4317294 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vaccine insert design ===

Immunogens can be targeted to various cellular compartments to improve antibody or cytotoxic T-cell responses. Secreted or [[plasma membrane]]-bound antigens are more effective at inducing antibody responses than [[cytosolic]] antigens, while [[cytotoxic T-cell]] responses can be improved by targeting antigens for cytoplasmic degradation and subsequent entry into the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) class I pathway.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt; This is usually accomplished by the addition of [[N-terminal]] [[ubiquitin]] signals.&lt;ref name=Rodriguez1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodriguez F, Zhang J, Whitton JL | title = DNA immunization: ubiquitination of a viral protein enhances cytotoxic T-lymphocyte induction and antiviral protection but abrogates antibody induction | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 71 | issue = 11 | pages = 8497–503 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9343207 | pmc = 192313 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.71.11.8497-8503.1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tobery1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tobery TW, Siliciano RF | title = Targeting of HIV-1 antigens for rapid intracellular degradation enhances cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recognition and the induction of de novo CTL responses in vivo after immunization | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 185 | issue = 5 | pages = 909–20 | date = March 1997 | pmid = 9120397 | pmc = 2196169 | doi = 10.1084/jem.185.5.909 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huebener N, Fest S, Strandsby A, Michalsky E, Preissner R, Zeng Y, Gaedicke G, Lode HN | title = A rationally designed tyrosine hydroxylase DNA vaccine induces specific antineuroblastoma immunity | journal = Molecular Cancer Therapeutics | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 2241–51 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18645033 | doi = 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0109 | authorlink8 = Lode HN, Fest S, Strandsby A, Michalsky E, Preissner R, Zeng Y, Gaedicke G, Lode HN | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[protein conformation|conformation]] of the protein can also affect antibody responses. “Ordered” structures (such as viral particles) are more effective than unordered structures.&lt;ref name=Wunderlich2000&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wunderlich G, Moura IC, del Portillo HA | title = Genetic immunization of BALB/c mice with a plasmid bearing the gene coding for a hybrid merozoite surface protein 1-hepatitis B virus surface protein fusion protects mice against lethal Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi PC1 infection | journal = Infection and Immunity | volume = 68 | issue = 10 | pages = 5839–45 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 10992493 | pmc = 101545 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.68.10.5839-5845.2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strings of minigenes (or MHC class I [[epitopes]]) from different pathogens raise cytotoxic T-cell responses to some pathogens, especially if a TH epitope is also included.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt;

== Delivery  ==

[[Image:Gene therapy.jpg|thumb|right|DNA vaccine and Gene therapy techniques are similar.]]
DNA vaccines have been introduced into animal tissues by multiple methods.

=== Saline injection ===
The two most popular approaches are injection of DNA in [[Saline (medicine)|saline]], using a standard hypodermic needle and [[gene gun]] delivery.&lt;ref name="Weiner1999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiner DB, Kennedy RC | year = 1999 | title = Genetic vaccines | journal = Scientific American | volume = 281 | issue = 1 | pages = 34–41 | url = http://www.sciamdigital.com/gsp_qpdf.cfm?ISSUEID_CHAR=8FF32714-CA1C-4025-BE8D-0FE4B5C348B&amp;ARTICLEID_CHAR=14F98F90-1708-4B77-A8D4-44F867A153F | access-date = 2007-11-21 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0799-50 | pmid = 10396782 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090325025916/http://www.sciam.com/media/inline/000052A5-43F6-1CBC-B4A8809EC588EEDF_arch2.gif | archive-date = 2009-03-25 | url-status = dead | bibcode = 1999SciAm.281a..50W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Injection in saline is normally conducted intramuscularly (IM) in [[skeletal muscle]], or [[dermis|intradermally]] (ID), delivering DNA to extracellular spaces. This can be assisted by [[electroporation]];&lt;ref name="Widera2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Widera G, Austin M, Rabussay D, Goldbeck C, Barnett SW, Chen M, Leung L, Otten GR, Thudium K, Selby MJ, Ulmer JB | title = Increased DNA vaccine delivery and immunogenicity by electroporation in vivo | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 164 | issue = 9 | pages = 4635–40 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10779767 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.164.9.4635 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; by temporarily damaging muscle fibres with myotoxins such as [[bupivacaine]]; or by using hypertonic solutions of saline or [[sucrose]].&lt;ref name="Alarcon1999" /&gt; Immune responses to this method can be affected by factors including needle type,&lt;ref name="Sedegah1994" /&gt; needle alignment, speed of injection, volume of injection, muscle type, and age, sex and physiological condition of the recipient.&lt;ref name="Alarcon1999" /&gt;

=== Gene gun ===
[[Gene gun]] delivery ballistically accelerates plasmid DNA (pDNA) that has been absorbed onto [[gold]] or [[tungsten]] microparticles into the target cells, using compressed [[helium]] as an accelerant.&lt;ref name="Alarcon1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis1999" /&gt;

=== Dosage ===
The delivery method determines the dose required to raise an effective immune response. Saline injections require variable amounts of DNA, from 10&amp;nbsp;μg-1&amp;nbsp;mg, whereas gene gun deliveries require 100 to 1000 times less.&lt;ref name="Fynan1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fynan EF, Webster RG, Fuller DH, Haynes JR, Santoro JC, Robinson HL | title = DNA vaccines: protective immunizations by parenteral, mucosal, and gene-gun inoculations | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 90 | issue = 24 | pages = 11478–82 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 8265577 | pmc = 48007 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.90.24.11478 | bibcode = 1993PNAS...9011478F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, 0.2&amp;nbsp;μg – 20&amp;nbsp;μg are required, although quantities as low as 16&amp;nbsp;ng have been reported.&lt;ref name="Alarcon1999" /&gt; These quantities vary by species. Mice for example, require approximately 10 times less DNA than [[primates]].&lt;ref name="Robinson2000" /&gt; Saline injections require more DNA because the DNA is delivered to the extracellular spaces of the target tissue (normally muscle), where it has to overcome physical barriers (such as the [[basal lamina]] and large amounts of [[connective tissue]], to mention a few) before it is taken up by the cells, while gene gun deliveries bombard DNA directly into the cells, resulting in less “wastage”.&lt;ref name="Alarcon1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson2000" /&gt;

Another approach to DNA vaccination is [[expression library]] immunization (ELI). Using this technique, potentially all the genes from a pathogen can be delivered at one time, which may be useful for pathogens that are difficult to attenuate or culture.&lt;ref name="Alarcon1999" /&gt; ELI can be used to identify which genes induce a protective response.

== Immune response ==

=== Helper T cell responses ===

[[Image:Antigen presentation.svg|thumb|right|Antigen presentation stimulates T cells to become either "cytotoxic" CD8+ cells or "helper" CD4+ cells. Cytotoxic cells directly attack other cells carrying certain foreign or abnormal molecules on their surfaces. Helper T cells, or Th cells, coordinate immune responses by communicating with other cells. In most cases, T cells only recognize an antigen if it is carried on the surface of a cell by one of the body's own MHC, or major histocompatibility complex, molecules.]]
DNA immunization can raise multiple T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; responses, including lymphoproliferation and the generation of a variety of [[cytokine]] profiles. A major advantage of DNA vaccines is the ease with which they can be manipulated to bias the type of T-cell help towards a TH1 or TH2 response.&lt;ref name=Feltquate1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Feltquate DM, Heaney S, Webster RG, Robinson HL | title = Different T helper cell types and antibody isotypes generated by saline and gene gun DNA immunization | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 158 | issue = 5 | pages = 2278–84 | date = March 1997 | pmid = 9036975 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/158/5/2278 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each type has distinctive patterns of [[lymphokine]] and chemokine expression, specific types of [[immunoglobulins]], patterns of lymphocyte trafficking and types of [[innate immune response]]s.

==== Other types of T-cell help ====

The type of T-cell help raised is influenced by the delivery method and the type of immunogen expressed, as well as the targeting of different lymphoid compartments.&lt;ref name=Alarcon1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=References1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyle CM, Morin M, Webster RG, Robinson HL | title = Role of different lymphoid tissues in the initiation and maintenance of DNA-raised antibody responses to the influenza virus H1 glycoprotein | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 70 | issue = 12 | pages = 9074–8 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 8971047 | pmc = 191015 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.70.12.9074-9078.1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, saline needle injections (either IM or ID) tend to induce TH1 responses, while gene gun delivery raises TH2 responses.&lt;ref name=Feltquate1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=References1996 /&gt; This is true for intracellular and plasma membrane-bound antigens, but not for secreted antigens, which seem to generate TH2 responses, regardless of the method of delivery.&lt;ref name="Sällberg1997"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sällberg M, Townsend K, Chen M, O'Dea J, Banks T, Jolly DJ, Chang SM, Lee WT, Milich DR | title = Characterization of humoral and CD4+ cellular responses after genetic immunization with retroviral vectors expressing different forms of the hepatitis B virus core and e antigens | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 71 | issue = 7 | pages = 5295–303 | date = July 1997 | pmid = 9188598 | pmc = 191766 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.71.7.5295-5303.1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the type of T-cell help raised is stable over time, and does not change when challenged or after subsequent immunizations that would normally have raised the opposite type of response in a naïve specimen.&lt;ref name=Feltquate1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=References1996 /&gt; However, Mor ''et al.''. (1995)&lt;ref name=Mor1995 /&gt; immunized and boosted mice with pDNA encoding the circumsporozoite protein of the mouse [[malaria]]l parasite ''[[Plasmodium yoelii]]'' (PyCSP) and found that the initial TH2 response changed, after boosting, to a TH1 response.

==== Basis for different types of T-cell help ====

How these different methods operate, the forms of antigen expressed, and the different profiles of T-cell help is not understood. It was thought that the relatively large amounts of DNA used in IM injection were responsible for the induction of TH1 responses. However, evidence shows no dose-related differences in TH type.&lt;ref name=Feltquate1997 /&gt; The type of T-cell help raised is determined by the differentiated state of [[antigen presenting cells]]. [[Dendritic cells]] can differentiate to secrete [[interleukin|IL-12]] (which supports TH1 cell development) or [[Interleukin-4 receptor|IL-4]] (which supports TH2 responses).&lt;ref name=Banchereau1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Banchereau J, Steinman RM | title = Dendritic cells and the control of immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 392 | issue = 6673 | pages = 245–52 | date = March 1998 | pmid = 9521319 | doi = 10.1038/32588 | authorlink1 = Jacques Banchereau | bibcode = 1998Natur.392..245B | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/431becc761a0da9aa63f47c08cae0247250775cf }}&lt;/ref&gt; pDNA injected by needle is [[endocytosis|endocytosed]] into the dendritic cell, which is then stimulated to differentiate for TH1 [[cytokine]] production,&lt;ref name=Jakob1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jakob T, Walker PS, Krieg AM, Udey MC, Vogel JC | title = Activation of cutaneous dendritic cells by CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides: a role for dendritic cells in the augmentation of Th1 responses by immunostimulatory DNA | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 161 | issue = 6 | pages = 3042–9 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9743369 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/161/6/3042 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the gene gun bombards the DNA directly into the cell, thus bypassing TH1 stimulation.

==== Practical uses of polarised T-cell help ====

Polarisation in T-cell help is useful in influencing [[allergic]] responses and [[autoimmune diseases]]. In autoimmune diseases, the goal is to shift the self-destructive TH1 response (with its associated cytotoxic T cell activity) to a non-destructive TH2 response. This has been successfully applied in predisease priming for the desired type of response in preclinical models&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt; and is somewhat successful in shifting the response for an established disease.&lt;ref name=Raz1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raz E, Tighe H, Sato Y, Corr M, Dudler JA, Roman M, Swain SL, Spiegelberg HL, Carson DA | title = Preferential induction of a Th1 immune response and inhibition of specific IgE antibody formation by plasmid DNA immunization | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 93 | issue = 10 | pages = 5141–5 | date = May 1996 | pmid = 8643542 | pmc = 39421 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.10.5141 | bibcode = 1996PNAS...93.5141R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cytotoxic T-cell responses ===

One of the advantages of DNA vaccines is that they are able to induce [[Cytotoxic T cell|cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] (CTL) without the inherent risk associated with live vaccines. CTL responses can be raised against immunodominant and immunorecessive CTL epitopes,&lt;ref name=Fu1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu TM, Friedman A, Ulmer JB, Liu MA, Donnelly JJ | title = Protective cellular immunity: cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses against dominant and recessive epitopes of influenza virus nucleoprotein induced by DNA immunization | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 71 | issue = 4 | pages = 2715–21 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9060624 | pmc = 191393 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.71.4.2715-2721.1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as subdominant CTL epitopes,&lt;ref name=Chen1998 /&gt; in a manner that appears to mimic natural [[infection]]. This may prove to be a useful tool in assessing CTL epitopes and their role in providing immunity.

Cytotoxic T-cells recognise small [[peptides]] (8-10 [[amino acids]]) complexed to [[MHC class I]] molecules.&lt;ref name=Restifo1995 /&gt; These peptides are derived from endogenous cytosolic proteins that are degraded and delivered to the nascent MHC class I molecule within the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER).&lt;ref name=Restifo1995&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Restifo NP, Bacík I, Irvine KR, Yewdell JW, McCabe BJ, Anderson RW, Eisenlohr LC, Rosenberg SA, Bennink JR | title = Antigen processing in vivo and the elicitation of primary CTL responses | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 154 | issue = 9 | pages = 4414–22 | date = May 1995 | pmid = 7722298 | pmc = 1952186 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/154/9/4414 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Targeting gene products directly to the ER (by the addition of an [[amino-terminal]] insertion [[protein sequence|sequence]]) should thus enhance CTL responses. This was successfully demonstrated using recombinant [[vaccinia]] viruses expressing [[influenza]] proteins,&lt;ref name=Restifo1995 /&gt; but the principle should also be applicable to DNA vaccines. Targeting antigens for intracellular degradation (and thus entry into the MHC class I pathway) by the addition of [[ubiquitin]] signal sequences, or mutation of other signal sequences, was shown to be effective at increasing CTL responses.&lt;ref name=Tobery1997 /&gt;

CTL responses can be enhanced by co-inoculation with co-stimulatory molecules such as [[CD80|B7-1]] or [[CD86|B7-2]] for DNA vaccines against influenza nucleoprotein,&lt;ref name=Fu1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Iwasaki1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwasaki A, Stiernholm BJ, Chan AK, Berinstein NL, Barber BH | title = Enhanced CTL responses mediated by plasmid DNA immunogens encoding costimulatory molecules and cytokines | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 158 | issue = 10 | pages = 4591–601 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9144471 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/158/10/4591 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[GM-CSF]] for DNA vaccines against the murine malaria model ''[[Plasmodium yoelii|P. yoelii]]''.&lt;ref name=Weiss1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss WR, Ishii KJ, Hedstrom RC, Sedegah M, Ichino M, Barnhart K, Klinman DM, Hoffman SL | title = A plasmid encoding murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor increases protection conferred by a malaria DNA vaccine | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 161 | issue = 5 | pages = 2325–32 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9725227 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/161/5/2325 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-inoculation with plasmids encoding co-stimulatory molecules IL-12 and TCA3 were shown to increase CTL activity against HIV-1 and influenza nucleoprotein antigens.&lt;ref name=Iwasaki1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsuji1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsuji T, Hamajima K, Fukushima J, Xin KQ, Ishii N, Aoki I, Ishigatsubo Y, Tani K, Kawamoto S, Nitta Y, Miyazaki J, Koff WC, Okubo T, Okuda K | title = Enhancement of cell-mediated immunity against HIV-1 induced by coinnoculation of plasmid-encoded HIV-1 antigen with plasmid expressing IL-12 | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 158 | issue = 8 | pages = 4008–13 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9103472 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/158/8/4008 | displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humoral (antibody) response ===

[[Image:Antibody.svg|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of an antibody and antigens]]
Antibody responses elicited by DNA vaccinations are influenced by multiple variables, including antigen type; antigen location (i.e. intracellular vs. secreted); number, frequency and immunization dose; site and method of antigen delivery.

==== Kinetics of antibody response ====

Humoral responses after a single DNA injection can be much longer-lived than after a single injection with a recombinant protein. Antibody responses against [[hepatitis B]] virus (HBV) envelope protein (HBsAg) have been sustained for up to 74 weeks without boost, while lifelong maintenance of protective response to influenza [[haemagglutinin]] was demonstrated in mice after gene gun delivery.&lt;ref name=Justewicz1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Justewicz DM, Webster RG | title = Long-term maintenance of B cell immunity to influenza virus hemagglutinin in mice following DNA-based immunization | journal = Virology | volume = 224 | issue = 1 | pages = 10–7 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 8862394 | doi = 10.1006/viro.1996.0501 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibody-secreting cells migrate to the [[bone marrow]] and [[spleen]] for long-term antibody production, and generally localise there after one year.&lt;ref name=Justewicz1996 /&gt;

Comparisons of antibody responses generated by natural (viral) infection, immunization with recombinant protein and immunization with pDNA are summarised in Table 4. DNA-raised antibody responses rise much more slowly than when natural infection or recombinant protein immunization occurs. As many as 12 weeks may be required to reach peak titres in mice, although boosting can decrease the interval. This response is probably due to the low levels of antigen expressed over several weeks, which supports both primary and secondary phases of antibody response. DNA vaccine expressing HBV small and middle envelope protein was injected into adults with chronic hepatitis. The vaccine resulted in specific interferon gamma cell production. Also specific T-cells for middle envelop proteins antigens were developed. The immune response of the patients was not robust enough to control HBV infection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mancini-Bourgine M, Fontaine H, Bréchot C, Pol S, Michel ML | title = Immunogenicity of a hepatitis B DNA vaccine administered to chronic HBV carriers | journal = Vaccine | volume = 24 | issue = 21 | pages = 4482–9 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16310901 | doi = 10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.08.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the titres of specific antibodies raised by DNA vaccination are lower than those obtained after vaccination with a recombinant protein. However, DNA immunization-induced antibodies show greater affinity to native epitopes than recombinant protein-induced antibodies. In other words, DNA immunization induces a qualitatively superior response. Antibodies can be induced after one vaccination with DNA, whereas recombinant protein vaccinations generally require a boost. DNA immunization can be used to bias the TH profile of the immune response and thus the antibody isotype, which is not possible with either natural infection or recombinant protein immunization. Antibody responses generated by DNA are useful as a preparative tool. For example, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies can be generated for use as reagents.

Using [[electron microscopy]], it was proposed that DNA uptake was facilitated by [[caveolae]] (or, non-clathrin coated pits).&lt;ref name=Anderson1992&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson RG, Kamen BA, Rothberg KG, Lacey SW | title = Potocytosis: sequestration and transport of small molecules by caveolae | journal = Science | volume = 255 | issue = 5043 | pages = 410–1 | date = January 1992 | pmid = 1310359 | doi = 10.1126/science.1310359 | bibcode = 1992Sci...255..410A }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent research revealed that other cells (such as [[keratinocytes]], [[fibroblasts]] and [[epithelial]] [[Langerhans cells]]) could also internalize DNA.&lt;ref name=Raz1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=Casares1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Casares S, Inaba K, Brumeanu TD, Steinman RM, Bona CA | title = Antigen presentation by dendritic cells after immunization with DNA encoding a major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted viral epitope | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 186 | issue = 9 | pages = 1481–6 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9348305 | pmc = 2199124 | doi = 10.1084/jem.186.9.1481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism of DNA uptake is not known.

Two theories dominate – that ''in vivo'' uptake of DNA occurs non-specifically, in a method similar to [[phagocytosis|phago]]- or [[pinocytosis]],&lt;ref name=Lewis1999 /&gt; or through specific receptors.&lt;ref name=Bennett1985&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bennett RM, Gabor GT, Merritt MM | title = DNA binding to human leukocytes.

The 30kDa surface receptor binds specifically to 4500-bp DNA fragments (which are then internalised) and is found on professional APCs and T-cells. Macrophage scavenger receptors bind to a variety of macromolecules, including poly[[ribonucleotides]] and are thus candidates for DNA uptake.&lt;ref name=Bennett1985 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bennet1988&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bennet RM, Hefeneider SH, Bakke A, Merritt M, Smith CA, Mourich D, Heinrich MC | title = The production and characterization of murine monoclonal antibodies to a DNA receptor on human leukocytes | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 140 | issue = 9 | pages = 2937–42 | date = May 1988 | pmid = 2452195 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/140/9/2937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Receptor-mediated DNA uptake could be facilitated by the presence of [[guanine|polyguanylate sequences]]. Gene gun delivery systems, cationic liposome packaging, and other delivery methods bypass this entry method, but understanding it may be useful in reducing costs (e.g. by reducing the requirement for cytofectins), which could be important in animal husbandry.

=== Antigen presentation by bone marrow-derived cells ===

[[Image:Dendritic cell.JPG|thumb|right|A dendritic cell.]]

Studies using [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric]] mice have shown that antigen is presented by bone-marrow derived cells, which include dendritic cells, macrophages and specialised [[B-cells]] called professional [[antigen presenting cells]] (APC).&lt;ref name=Iwasaki1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Corr1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Corr M, Lee DJ, Carson DA, Tighe H | title = Gene vaccination with naked plasmid DNA: mechanism of CTL priming | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 184 | issue = 4 | pages = 1555–60 | date = October 1996 | pmid = 8879229 | pmc = 2192808 | doi = 10.1084/jem.184.4.1555 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After gene gun inoculation to the skin, transfected [[Langerhans cell]]s migrate to the draining [[lymph node]] to present antigens.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt; After IM and ID injections, dendritic cells present antigen in the draining lymph node&lt;ref name=Casares1997 /&gt; and transfected macrophages have been found in the peripheral blood.&lt;ref name=Chattergoon1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chattergoon MA, Robinson TM, Boyer JD, Weiner DB | title = Specific immune induction following DNA-based immunization through in vivo transfection and activation of macrophages/antigen-presenting cells | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 160 | issue = 12 | pages = 5707–18 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9637479 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/160/12/5707 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides direct transfection of dendritic cells or macrophages, cross priming occurs following IM, ID and gene gun DNA deliveries. Cross-priming occurs when a bone marrow-derived cell presents peptides from proteins synthesised in another cell in the context of MHC class 1. This can prime cytotoxic T-cell responses and seems to be important for a full primary immune response.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Torres1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Torres CA, Iwasaki A, Barber BH, Robinson HL | title = Differential dependence on target site tissue for gene gun and intramuscular DNA immunizations | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 158 | issue = 10 | pages = 4529–32 | date = May 1997 | pmid = 9144463 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9144463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Target site role ===

IM and ID DNA delivery initiate immune responses differently. In the skin, keratinocytes, fibroblasts and Langerhans cells take up and express antigens and are responsible for inducing a primary antibody response. Transfected Langerhans cells migrate out of the skin (within 12 hours) to the draining lymph node where they prime secondary B- and T-cell responses. In skeletal muscle striated muscle cells are most frequently transfected, but seem to be unimportant in immune response. Instead, IM inoculated DNA “washes” into the draining lymph node within minutes, where distal dendritic cells are transfected and then initiate an immune response. Transfected myocytes seem to act as a “reservoir” of antigen for trafficking professional APCs.&lt;ref name=Lewis1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolff1992 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Torres1997 /&gt;

=== Maintenance of immune response ===
DNA vaccination generates an effective immune memory via the display of antigen-antibody complexes on [[follicular dendritic cells]] (FDC), which are potent B-cell stimulators. T-cells can be stimulated by similar, germinal centre dendritic cells. FDC are able to generate an immune memory because antibodies production “overlaps” long-term expression of antigen, allowing antigen-antibody immunocomplexes to form and be displayed by FDC.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt;

=== Interferons ===

Both helper and cytotoxic T-cells can control viral infections by secreting interferons. Cytotoxic T cells usually kill virally infected cells. However, they can also be stimulated to secrete antiviral cytokines such as [[Interferon gamma|IFN-γ]] and [[Tumor necrosis factor alpha|TNF-α]], which do not kill the cell, but limit viral infection by down-regulating the expression of viral components.&lt;ref name=Franco1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franco A, Guidotti LG, Hobbs MV, Pasquetto V, Chisari FV | title = Pathogenetic effector function of CD4-positive T helper 1 cells in hepatitis B virus transgenic mice | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 159 | issue = 4 | pages = 2001–8 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9257867 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/159/4/2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA vaccinations can be used to curb viral infections by non-destructive IFN-mediated control.

== Immune response modulation ==

=== Cytokine modulation ===

An effective vaccine must induce an appropriate immune response for a given pathogen. DNA vaccines can polarise T-cell help towards TH1 or TH2 profiles and generate CTL and/or antibody when required. This can be accomplished by modifications to the form of antigen expressed (i.e. intracellular vs. secreted), the method and route of delivery or the dose.&lt;ref name=Feltquate1997 /&gt;&lt;ref name=References1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Cardoso1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cardoso AI, Blixenkrone-Moller M, Fayolle J, Liu M, Buckland R, Wild TF | title = Immunization with plasmid DNA encoding for the measles virus hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein leads to humoral and cell-mediated immunity | journal = Virology | volume = 225 | issue = 2 | pages = 293–9 | date = November 1996 | pmid = 8918915 | doi = 10.1006/viro.1996.0603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sato1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sato Y, Roman M, Tighe H, Lee D, Corr M, Nguyen MD, Silverman GJ, Lotz M, Carson DA, Raz E | title = Immunostimulatory DNA sequences necessary for effective intradermal gene immunization | journal = Science | volume = 273 | issue = 5273 | pages = 352–4 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8662521 | doi = 10.1126/science.273.5273.352 | bibcode = 1996Sci...273..352S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss2000&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss R, Leitner WW, Scheiblhofer S, Chen D, Bernhaupt A, Mostböck S, Thalhamer J, Lyon JA | title = Genetic vaccination against malaria infection by intradermal and epidermal injections of a plasmid containing the gene encoding the Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein | journal = Infection and Immunity | volume = 68 | issue = 10 | pages = 5914–9 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 10992502 | pmc = 101554 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.68.10.5914-5919.2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be accomplished by the co-administration of plasmid DNA encoding immune regulatory molecules, i.e. cytokines, [[lymphokine]]s or co-stimulatory molecules. These “genetic [[adjuvants]]” can be administered as a:
* mixture of 2 plasmids, one encoding the immunogen and the other encoding the cytokine
* single bi- or polycistronic vector, separated by spacer regions
* plasmid-encoded [[Fusion protein|chimera]], or fusion protein
In general, co-administration of pro-inflammatory agents (such as various [[interleukins]], [[tumor necrosis factor]], and GM-CSF) plus TH2-inducing cytokines increase antibody responses, whereas pro-inflammatory agents and TH1-inducing cytokines decrease humoral responses and increase cytotoxic responses (more important in viral protection). Co-stimulatory molecules such as [[CD80|B7-1]], [[CD86|B7-2]] and [[CD154|CD40L]] are sometimes used.

This concept was applied in topical administration of pDNA encoding [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]].&lt;ref name=Daheshia1997 /&gt; Plasmid encoding B7-1 (a ligand on APCs) successfully enhanced the immune response in tumour models. Mixing plasmids encoding GM-CSF and the circumsporozoite protein of ''P. yoelii'' (PyCSP) enhanced protection against subsequent challenge (whereas plasmid-encoded PyCSP alone did not). It was proposed that GM-CSF caused dendritic cells to present antigen more efficiently and enhance IL-2 production and TH cell activation, thus driving the increased immune response.&lt;ref name=Weiss1998 /&gt; This can be further enhanced by first priming with a pPyCSP and pGM-CSF mixture, followed by boosting with a recombinant [[Poxviridae|poxvirus]] expressing PyCSP.&lt;ref name=Sedegah2000&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sedegah M, Weiss W, Sacci JB, Charoenvit Y, Hedstrom R, Gowda K, Majam VF, Tine J, Kumar S, Hobart P, Hoffman SL | title = Improving protective immunity induced by DNA-based immunization: priming with antigen and GM-CSF-encoding plasmid DNA and boosting with antigen-expressing recombinant poxvirus | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 164 | issue = 11 | pages = 5905–12 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10820272 | doi = 10.4049/jimmunol.164.11.5905 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, co-injection of plasmids encoding GM-CSF (or IFN-γ, or IL-2) and a fusion protein of ''[[Plasmodium chabaudi|P. chabaudi]]'' [[Apicomplexan life cycle|merozoite surface protein]] 1 (C-terminus)-hepatitis B virus surface protein (PcMSP1-HBs) abolished protection against challenge, compared to protection acquired by delivery of pPcMSP1-HBs alone.&lt;ref name=Wunderlich2000 /&gt;

The advantages of genetic adjuvants are their low cost and simple administration, as well as avoidance of unstable [[recombinant cytokine]]s and potentially toxic, “conventional” adjuvants (such as [[alum]], [[calcium phosphate]], monophosphoryl lipid A, [[cholera]] toxin, cationic and mannan-coated liposomes, [[QS21]], [[carboxymethyl cellulose]] and [[Ubenimex|ubenimix]]).&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis1999 /&gt; However, the potential toxicity of prolonged cytokine expression is not  established. In many commercially important animal species, cytokine genes have not been identified and isolated. In addition, various plasmid-encoded cytokines modulate the immune system differently according to the delivery time. For example, some cytokine plasmid DNAs are best delivered after immunogen pDNA, because pre- or co-delivery can decrease specific responses and increase non-specific responses.&lt;ref name=Barouch1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barouch DH, Santra S, Steenbeke TD, Zheng XX, Perry HC, Davies ME, Freed DC, Craiu A, Strom TB, Shiver JW, Letvin NL | title = Augmentation and suppression of immune responses to an HIV-1 DNA vaccine by plasmid cytokine/Ig administration | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 161 | issue = 4 | pages = 1875–82 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9712056 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/161/4/1875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immunostimulatory CpG motifs ===

Plasmid DNA itself appears to have an adjuvant effect on the immune system.&lt;ref name=Alarcon1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt; Bacterially derived DNA can trigger innate immune defence mechanisms, the activation of dendritic cells and the production of TH1 cytokines.&lt;ref name=Jakob1998 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Krieg1995&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krieg AM, Yi AK, Matson S, Waldschmidt TJ, Bishop GA, Teasdale R, Koretzky GA, Klinman DM | title = CpG motifs in bacterial DNA trigger direct B-cell activation | journal = Nature | volume = 374 | issue = 6522 | pages = 546–9 | date = April 1995 | pmid = 7700380 | doi = 10.1038/374546a0 | bibcode = 1995Natur.374..546K | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/7a001e629ec4b1e2e8620357c53eb6770c907ad2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to recognition of certain CpG dinucleotide sequences that are immunostimulatory.&lt;ref name=Sato1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Klinman1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klinman DM, Yamshchikov G, Ishigatsubo Y | title = Contribution of CpG motifs to the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 158 | issue = 8 | pages = 3635–9 | date = April 1997 | pmid = 9103425 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/158/8/3635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CpG stimulatory (CpG-S) sequences occur twenty times more frequently in bacterially-derived DNA than in eukaryotes. This is because eukaryotes exhibit “CpG suppression” – i.e. CpG dinucleotide pairs occur much less frequently than expected. Additionally, CpG-S sequences are hypomethylated. This occurs frequently in bacterial DNA, while CpG motifs occurring in eukaryotes are methylated at the cytosine nucleotide. In contrast, nucleotide sequences that inhibit the activation of an immune response (termed CpG neutralising, or CpG-N) are over represented in eukaryotic genomes.&lt;ref name=Krieg1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krieg AM, Wu T, Weeratna R, Efler SM, Love-Homan L, Yang L, Yi AK, Short D, Davis HL | title = Sequence motifs in adenoviral DNA block immune activation by stimulatory CpG motifs | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 21 | pages = 12631–6 | date = October 1998 | pmid = 9770537 | pmc = 22882 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.21.12631 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...9512631K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The optimal immunostimulatory sequence is an unmethylated CpG dinucleotide flanked by two 5’ [[purine]]s and two 3’ [[pyrimidine]]s.&lt;ref name=Sato1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Krieg1995 /&gt; Additionally, flanking regions outside this immunostimulatory [[Oligomer|hexamer]] must be [[guanine]]-rich to ensure binding and uptake into target cells.

The innate system works with the adaptive immune system to mount a response against the DNA encoded protein. CpG-S sequences induce polyclonal B-cell activation and the upregulation of cytokine expression and secretion.&lt;ref name=Klinsman1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klinman DM, Yi AK, Beaucage SL, Conover J, Krieg AM | title = CpG motifs present in bacteria DNA rapidly induce lymphocytes to secrete interleukin 6, interleukin 12, and interferon gamma | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 93 | issue = 7 | pages = 2879–83 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8610135 | pmc = 39727 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.7.2879 | bibcode = 1996PNAS...93.2879K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stimulated macrophages secrete IL-12, [[IL18BP|IL-18]], TNF-α, IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-γ, while stimulated B-cells secrete IL-6 and some IL-12.&lt;ref name=Lewis1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Klinsman1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yi1996&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yi AK, Chace JH, Cowdery JS, Krieg AM | title = IFN-gamma promotes IL-6 and IgM secretion in response to CpG motifs in bacterial DNA and oligodeoxynucleotides | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 156 | issue = 2 | pages = 558–64 | date = January 1996 | pmid = 8543806 | url = http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/156/2/558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manipulation of CpG-S and CpG-N sequences in the plasmid backbone of DNA vaccines can ensure the success of the immune response to the encoded antigen and drive the immune response toward a TH1 phenotype. This is useful if a pathogen requires a TH response for protection. CpG-S sequences have also been used as external adjuvants for both DNA and recombinant protein vaccination with variable success rates. Other organisms with hypomethylated CpG motifs have demonstrated the stimulation of polyclonal B-cell expansion. {{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The mechanism behind this may be more complicated than simple methylation – hypomethylated murine DNA has not been found to mount an immune response.

Most of the evidence for immunostimulatory CpG sequences comes from murine studies. Extrapolation of this data to other species requires caution – individual species may require different flanking sequences, as binding specificities of scavenger receptors vary across species. Additionally, species such as ruminants may be insensitive to immunostimulatory sequences due to their large gastrointestinal load.

=== Alternative boosts ===

DNA-primed immune responses can be boosted by the administration of recombinant protein or recombinant poxviruses. "Prime-boost" strategies with recombinant protein have successfully increased both neutralising antibody titre, and antibody avidity and persistence, for weak immunogens, such as HIV-1 envelope protein.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Letvin1997&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Letvin NL, Montefiori DC, Yasutomi Y, Perry HC, Davies ME, Lekutis C, Alroy M, Freed DC, Lord CI, Handt LK, Liu MA, Shiver JW | title = Potent, protective anti-HIV immune responses generated by bimodal HIV envelope DNA plus protein vaccination | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 17 | pages = 9378–83 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9256490 | pmc = 23198 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.17.9378 | bibcode = 1997PNAS...94.9378L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recombinant virus boosts have been shown to be very efficient at boosting DNA-primed CTL responses. Priming with DNA focuses the immune response on the required immunogen, while boosting with the recombinant virus provides a larger amount of expressed antigen, leading to a large increase in specific CTL responses.

Prime-boost strategies have been successful in inducing protection against malarial challenge in a number of studies. Primed mice with plasmid DNA encoding ''Plasmodium yoelii'' circumsporozoite surface protein (PyCSP), then boosted with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the same protein had significantly higher levels of antibody, CTL activity and IFN-γ, and hence higher levels of protection, than mice immunized and boosted with plasmid DNA alone.&lt;ref name=Sedegah1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sedegah M, Jones TR, Kaur M, Hedstrom R, Hobart P, Tine JA, Hoffman SL | title = Boosting with recombinant vaccinia increases immunogenicity and protective efficacy of malaria DNA vaccine | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 13 | pages = 7648–53 | date = June 1998 | pmid = 9636204 | pmc = 22711 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.13.7648 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.7648S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be further enhanced by priming with a mixture of plasmids encoding PyCSP and murine GM-CSF, before boosting with recombinant vaccinia virus.&lt;ref name=Sedegah2000 /&gt; An effective prime-boost strategy for the [[simian]] malarial model ''P. knowlesi'' has also been demonstrated.&lt;ref name=Rogers2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogers WO, Baird JK, Kumar A, Tine JA, Weiss W, Aguiar JC, Gowda K, Gwadz R, Kumar S, Gold M, Hoffman SL | title = Multistage multiantigen heterologous prime boost vaccine for Plasmodium knowlesi malaria provides partial protection in rhesus macaques | journal = Infection and Immunity | volume = 69 | issue = 9 | pages = 5565–72 | date = September 2001 | pmid = 11500430 | pmc = 98670 | doi = 10.1128/IAI.69.9.5565-5572.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhesus monkeys]] were primed with a multicomponent, multistage DNA vaccine encoding two liver-stage antigens – the circumsporozoite surface protein (PkCSP) and sporozoite surface protein 2 (PkSSP2) – and two blood stage antigens – the apical merozoite surface protein 1 (PkAMA1) and merozoite surface protein 1 (PkMSP1p42). They were then boosted with a recombinant canarypox virus encoding all four antigens (ALVAC-4). Immunized monkeys developed antibodies against sporozoites and infected erythrocytes, and IFN-γ-secreting T-cell responses against peptides from PkCSP. Partial protection against sporozoite challenge was achieved, and mean parasitemia was significantly reduced, compared to control monkeys. These models, while not ideal for extrapolation to ''P. falciparum'' in humans, will be important in pre-clinical trials.

=== Enhancing immune responses ===

==== DNA ====

The efficiency of DNA immunization can be improved by stabilising DNA against degradation, and increasing the efficiency of delivery of DNA into [[antigen-presenting cell]]s.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt; This has been demonstrated by coating biodegradable cationic microparticles (such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) formulated with [[Cetrimonium bromide|cetyltrimethylammonium bromide]]) with DNA. Such DNA-coated microparticles can be as effective at raising CTL as recombinant viruses, especially when mixed with alum. Particles 300&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter appear to be most efficient for uptake by antigen presenting cells.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt;

==== Alphavirus vectors ====

Recombinant alphavirus-based vectors have been used to improve DNA vaccination efficiency.&lt;ref name=Robinson2000 /&gt; The gene encoding the antigen of interest is inserted into the alphavirus replicon, replacing structural genes but leaving non-structural replicase genes intact. The [[Sindbis virus]] and [[Semliki Forest virus]] have been used to build recombinant [[alphavirus]] [[Replicon (genetics)|replicons]]. Unlike conventional DNA vaccinations alphavirus vectors kill transfected cells and are only transiently expressed. Alphavirus replicase genes are expressed in addition to the vaccine insert. It is not clear how alphavirus replicons raise an immune response, but it may be due to the high levels of protein expressed by this vector, replicon-induced cytokine responses, or replicon-induced apoptosis leading to enhanced antigen uptake by dendritic cells.
