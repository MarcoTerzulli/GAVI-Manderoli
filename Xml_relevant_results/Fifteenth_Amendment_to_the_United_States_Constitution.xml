{{US Constitution article series}}

The '''Fifteenth Amendment''' ('''Amendment XV''') to the [[United States Constitution]] prohibits the federal government and each state from denying a citizen the [[Suffrage|right to vote]] based on that citizen's "[[Race (human classification)|race]], [[Colored|color]], or previous condition of servitude." It was ratified on February 3, 1870,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/education/all_amendments_usconst.htm |work=University of Minnesota Human Rights Library |title=All Amendments to the United States Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the third and last of the [[Reconstruction Amendments]].

In the final years of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]] that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of the millions of former black slaves. By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the election of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of black male voters was important for the party's future. On February 26, 1869, after rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. After surviving a difficult ratification fight, the amendment was certified as duly ratified and part of the Constitution on March 30, 1870.

[[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decisions in the late nineteenth century interpreted the amendment narrowly. From 1890 to 1910, southern states adopted new state constitutions and enacted laws that raised barriers to voter registration. This resulted in most black voters and many poor white ones being [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] by [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] and discriminatory [[literacy test]]s, among other barriers to voting, from which white male voters were exempted by [[grandfather clause]]s. A system of [[white primaries]] and violent intimidation by white groups also [[Voter suppression|suppressed]] black participation.

In the twentieth century, the Court began to interpret the amendment more broadly, striking down grandfather clauses in ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'' (1915) and dismantling the white primary system in the "Texas primary cases" (1927–1953). Along with later measures such as the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]], which forbade poll taxes in federal elections, and ''[[Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections]]'' (1966), which forbade poll taxes in state elections, these decisions significantly increased black participation in the American political system. To enforce the amendment, Congress enacted the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which provided federal oversight of elections in discriminatory jurisdictions, banned literacy tests and similar discriminatory devices, and created legal remedies for people affected by voting discrimination.

The amendment created a split within the [[women's suffrage]] movement over the amendment not prohibiting denying the women the right to vote on account of sex. (Women gained the right to vote with the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1920.)

==Background==
In the final years of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]] that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and the 1865 [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be now counted rather than the three-fifths mandated by the previous [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}&lt;ref name="Stromberg111"&gt;Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=22}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fourteenth Amendment: From Political Principle to Judicial Doctrine|last=Nelson|first=William E.|year=1988|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04142-4|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VMCXjRyyKTQC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=thirteenth+amendment+%22three+fifths%22#v=onepage&amp;q=thirteenth%20amendment%20%22three%20fifths%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stromberg, "A Plain Folk Perspective" (2002), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, Congress passed what would become the [[Civil Rights Act of 1866]], guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] passed by many post-war Southern states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and by preventing them from suing or testifying in court.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=199–200}} Although strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, [[Andrew Johnson|President Johnson]] vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forner|first=Eric|title=Reconstruction:America's Unfinished Revolution|year=2002|origyear=1988|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-093716-5|pages=250–251|authorlink=Eric Forner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=0-7006-0190-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/70 70]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. This was the first time in American history that Congress was able to muster the votes necessary to override a presidential veto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castel|first=Albert E.|title=The Presidency of Andrew Johnson|series=American Presidency|year=1979|publisher=The Regents Press of Kansas|location=Lawrence, Kan.|isbn=0-7006-0190-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/71 71]|url=https://archive.org/details/presidencyofandr00albe/page/71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress possessed the constitutional power to turn those goals into laws.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Jeffrey. ''The Supreme Court: The Personalities and Rivalries That Defined America'', p. 79 (MacMillan 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Roger. ''The Constitution and its Amendments'', Vol. 4, p. 8 (Macmillan 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The experience encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|pp=22–23}}

On June 18, 1866, Congress adopted the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which guaranteed citizenship and equal protection under the laws regardless of race, and sent it to the states for ratification. After a bitter struggle that included attempted [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]]s of ratification by two states, the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted on July 28, 1868.&lt;ref name=Killian&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002|last=Killian|first=Johnny H.|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-072379-7|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bJjxj5gLRaEC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=seward+July+28,+1868+promulgate#v=onepage&amp;q=seward%20July%2028%2C%201868%20promulgate&amp;f=false|display-authors=etal|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment punished, by reduced representation in the House of Representatives, any state that disenfranchised any male citizens over 21 years of age. By failing to adopt a harsher penalty, this signaled to the states that they still possessed the right to deny ballot access based on race.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=255}} Northern states were generally as averse to granting voting rights to blacks as Southern states. In the year of its ratification, only eight Northern states allowed Blacks to vote.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=448}} In the South, Blacks were able to vote in many areas, but only through the intervention of the occupying [[Union Army]].{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=36}} Congress had granted suffrage to Blacks in the territories by passing the Territorial Suffrage Act in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Globe, 39th Congress, 2nd Session, pp. 381–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Anticipating an increase in Democratic membership in the following Congress, Republicans used the [[lame-duck session]] of the [[40th United States Congress]] to pass an amendment protecting black suffrage.&lt;ref name=Framing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000965.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610193453/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000965.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 10, 2014|title=Fifteenth Amendment: Framing and ratification|author=Gillette, William|year=1986|work=Encyclopedia of the American Constitution|publisher={{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=June 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representative [[John Bingham]], the primary author of the Fourteenth Amendment, pushed for a wide-ranging ban on suffrage limitations, but a broader proposal banning voter restriction on the basis of "race, color, nativity, property, education, or religious beliefs" was rejected.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=446–47}} A proposal to specifically ban [[literacy test]]s was also rejected.&lt;ref name=Framing/&gt; Some Representatives from the North, where [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]] was a major force, wished to preserve restrictions denying the franchise to foreign-born citizens, as did Representatives from the West, where ethnic [[Chinese American|Chinese]] were banned from voting.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=446–47}} Both Southern and Northern Republicans also wanted to continue to deny the vote temporarily to Southerners disfranchised for support of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and they were concerned that a sweeping endorsement of suffrage would enfranchise this group.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=447}}

A House and Senate [[Committee#Conference committee|conference committee]] proposed the amendment's final text, which banned voter restriction only on the basis of "race, color, or previous condition of servitude."&lt;ref name=Archives/&gt; To attract the broadest possible base of support, the amendment made no mention of [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] or other measures to block voting, and did not guarantee the right of blacks to hold office.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=37}} This compromise proposal was approved by the House on February 25, 1869, and the Senate the following day.{{sfn|Goldman|2001|p=3}}&lt;ref name=Harp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://15thamendment.harpweek.com/HubPages/CommentaryPage.asp?Commentary=01Timeline1869|title=Black Voting Rights: The History of the 15th Amendment|work=Harpers|accessdate=June 25, 2013|archivedate=January 15, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115144553/http://15thamendment.harpweek.com/HubPages/CommentaryPage.asp?Commentary=01Timeline1869|url-status=live|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vote in the House was 144 to 44, with 35 not voting. The House vote was almost entirely along party lines, with no Democrats supporting the bill and only 3 Republicans voting against it,{{sfn|Gillette|1965|pp=73–74}} some because they thought the amendment did not go far enough in its protections.&lt;ref name=Harp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Michael|last=Zak|url=http://grandoldpartisan.typepad.com/blog/2016/02/15th-amendment.html|title=Congratulating the Republican Party for according voting rights to African-Americans|date=February 26, 2016|work=Grand Old Partisan|publisher=TypePad|accessdate=March 2, 2016}}{{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Representatives passed the amendment with 143 Republican and 1 Conservative Republican votes of "Yes"; 39 Democrat, 3 Republican, 1 Independent Republican and 1 Conservative votes of "No"; 26 Republican, 8 Democrat and 1 Independent Republican not voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Globe, House of Representatives, 40th Congress, 3rd Session, page 1563-1564 In: A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 – 1875|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=087/llcg087.db&amp;recNum=62|website=memory.loc.gov|accessdate=July 6, 2014|date=February 25, 1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final vote in the Senate was 39 to 13, with 14 not voting.{{sfn|Gillette|1965|p=75}} The Senate passed the amendment with a vote of 39 Republican votes of "Yea", 8 Democrat and 5 Republican votes of "Nay"; 13 Republican and 1 Democrat not voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congressional Globe, Senate, 40th Congress, 3rd Session, page 1641 In: A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 – 1875|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llcg&amp;fileName=087/llcg087.db&amp;recNum=140|website=memory.loc.gov|accessdate=July 6, 2014|date=February 26, 1869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Radical Republicans, such as Massachusetts Senator [[Charles Sumner]], abstained from voting because the amendment did not prohibit literacy tests and poll taxes.{{sfn|Gillette|1965|p=76}} Following congressional approval, the proposed amendment was then sent by Secretary of State William Henry Seward to the states for ratification or rejection.&lt;ref name=Harp/&gt;

Though many of the original proposals for the amendment had been moderated by negotiations in committee, the final draft nonetheless faced significant hurdles in being ratified by three-fourths of the states. Historian William Gillette wrote of the process, "it was hard going and the outcome was uncertain until the very end."&lt;ref name=Framing/&gt;

One source of opposition to the proposed amendment was the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] movement, which before and during the Civil War had made common cause with the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement. However, with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, which had explicitly protected only male citizens in its second section, activists found the civil rights of women divorced from those of blacks.{{sfn|Foner|1988|p=255}} Matters came to a head with the proposal of the Fifteenth Amendment, which barred race discrimination but not sex discrimination in voter laws. After an acrimonious debate, the [[American Equal Rights Association]], the nation's leading suffragist group, split into two rival organizations: the [[National Woman Suffrage Association]] of [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who opposed the amendment, and the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] of [[Lucy Stone]] and [[Henry Browne Blackwell]], who supported it. The two groups remained divided until the 1890s.{{sfn|Foner|1988|pp=447–48}}

Nevada was the first state to ratify the amendment, on March 1, 1869.&lt;ref name=Harp/&gt; The New England states and most Midwest states also ratified the amendment soon after its proposal.&lt;ref name=Framing /&gt; Southern states still controlled by Radical reconstruction governments, such as North Carolina, also swiftly ratified.{{sfn|Goldman|2001|p=3}} Newly elected President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] strongly endorsed the amendment, calling it "a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day." He privately asked Nebraska's governor to call a special legislative session to speed the process, securing the state's ratification.&lt;ref name=Framing/&gt; In April and December 1869, Congress passed Reconstruction bills mandating that Virginia, Mississippi, Texas and Georgia ratify the amendment as a precondition to regaining congressional representation; all four states did so.&lt;ref name=Harp/&gt; The struggle for ratification was particularly close in Indiana and Ohio, which voted to ratify in May 1869 and January 1870, respectively.&lt;ref name=Framing /&gt;&lt;ref name=Harp/&gt; New York, which had ratified on April 14, 1869, tried to revoke its ratification on January 5, 1870. However, in February 1870, Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas ratified the amendment, bringing the total ratifying states to twenty-nine—one more than the required twenty-eight ratifications from the thirty-seven states, and forestalling any court challenge to New York's resolution to withdraw its consent.&lt;ref name=Harp/&gt;

The amendment's adoption was met with widespread celebrations in black communities and abolitionist societies; many of the latter disbanded, feeling that black rights had been secured and their work was complete. President Grant said of the amendment that it "completes the greatest civil change and constitutes the most important event that has occurred since the nation came to life".&lt;ref name=Framing/&gt; Many Republicans felt that with the amendment's passage, black Americans no longer needed federal protection; congressman and future president [[James A. Garfield]] stated that the amendment's passage "confers upon the African race the care of its own destiny. It places their fortunes in their own hands."{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=37}} Congressman [[John R. Lynch]] later wrote that ratification of those two amendments made Reconstruction a success.&lt;ref name="lynch"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2713394?seq=1 John R.

==Application==
In the year of the 150th anniversary of the Fifteenth Amendment Columbia University history professor and historian [[Eric Foner]] said about the Fifteenth Amendment as well as its history during the [[Reconstruction era]] and Post-Reconstruction era:

{{quote|It’s a remarkable accomplishment given that slavery was such a dominant institution before the Civil War. But the history of the 15th Amendment also shows rights can never be taken for granted: Things can be achieved and things can be taken away.&lt;ref name="20200203USATodayJervis" /&gt;}}

===Reconstruction===
African Americans called the amendment the nation’s “[[Gettysburg Address|second birth]]” and a “[[American Revolution|greater revolution than that of 1776]]” according to historian Eric Foner in his book "The Second Founding: How the Civil War and Reconstruction Remade the Constitution".&lt;ref name="20200203USATodayJervis" /&gt; 
The first black person known to vote after the amendment's adoption was [[Thomas Mundy Peterson]], who cast his ballot on March 31, 1870, in a [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey]] referendum election adopting a revised city charter.&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Gordon. ''North Jersey Legacies: Hidden History from the Gateway to the Skylands''. The History Press, 2012, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans – many of them newly freed slaves – put their newfound freedom to use, voting in scores of Black candidates. During Reconstruction, 16 Black men served in Congress and 2,000 Black men served in elected local, state and federal positions according to Columbia University history professor Eric Foner.&lt;ref name="20200203USATodayJervis"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jervis|first1=Rick|title=Black Americans got the right to vote 150 years ago, but voter suppression still a problem|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/03/black-voting-rights-15th-amendment-still-challenged-after-150-years/4587160002/|accessdate=April 25, 2020|publisher=USA Today|date=February 3, 2020|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200425165501/https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/02/03/black-voting-rights-15th-amendment-still-challenged-after-150-years/4587160002/|archivedate=April 25, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[United States v. Reese]]'' (1876),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|92|214|1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision interpreting the Fifteenth Amendment, the Court interpreted the amendment narrowly, upholding ostensibly race-neutral limitations on suffrage including [[Poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], [[literacy test]]s, and a [[grandfather clause]] that exempted citizens from other voting requirements if their grandfathers had been registered voters, a condition only white men could generally meet.{{sfn|Johnson|2000|p=661}}{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=97}} The Court also stated that the amendment does not confer the right of suffrage, but it invests citizens of the United States with the right of exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise on account of their race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and empowers Congress to enforce that right by "appropriate legislation".&lt;ref name="See "&gt;See ''{{ussc|92|214|1876}}''&lt;/ref&gt; The Court wrote:

{{quote|The Fifteenth Amendment does not confer the right of suffrage upon anyone. It prevents the States, or the United States, however, from giving preference, in this particular, to one citizen of the United States over another on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. Before its adoption, this could be done. It was as much within the power of a State to exclude citizens of the United States from voting on account of race, &amp;c., as it was on account of age, property, or education. Now it is not. If citizens of one race having certain qualifications are permitted by law to vote, those of another having the same qualifications must be. Previous to this amendment, there was no constitutional guaranty against this discrimination: now there is. It follows that the amendment has invested the citizens of the United States with a new constitutional right which is within the protecting power of Congress. That right is an exemption from discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This, under the express provisions of the second section of the amendment, Congress may enforce by "appropriate legislation."&lt;ref name="See "/&gt;}}

[[White supremacy|White supremacists]], such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), used paramilitary violence to prevent blacks from voting. A number of blacks were killed at the [[Colfax massacre]] of 1873 while attempting to defend their right to vote. The [[Enforcement Acts]] were passed by Congress in 1870–1871 to authorize federal prosecution of the KKK and others who violated the amendment.{{sfn|Goldstone|2011|p=91}} However, as Reconstruction neared its end and federal troops withdrew, prosecutions under the Enforcement Acts dropped significantly. In ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876), the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government did not have the authority to prosecute the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre because they were not [[state actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|92|542|1876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Judicial&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000966.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924171030/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425000966.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 24, 2015|title=Fifteenth Amendment (Judicial Interpretation)|author=Elliott, Ward E.

===Post-Reconstruction===
From 1890 to 1910, poll taxes and literacy tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising the great majority of black men. [[White male primaries|White male-only primary elections]] also served to reduce the influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks were excluded from the political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of [[Lynching|lynch mob]]s and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan.{{sfn|Johnson|2000|p=661}} Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as [[William Bourke Cockran]] of [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=GOPTextbookColored&gt;{{cite book|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/murray:@field(DOCID+@lit(lcrbmrpt1615div1))|title=A Republican Text-Book for Colored Voters|first1=Thomas H.R.|last1=Clarke|first2=Barney|last2=McKay|accessdate=February 28, 2016|date=1901|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=T.

In the 20th century, the Court began to read the Fifteenth Amendment more broadly.&lt;ref name=Judicial/&gt; In ''[[Guinn v. United States]]'' (1915),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|238|347|1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; a unanimous Court struck down an Oklahoma grandfather clause that effectively exempted white voters from a literacy test, finding it to be discriminatory. The Court ruled in the related case ''[[Myers v. Anderson]]'' (1915), that the officials who enforced such a clause were liable for civil damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|238|368|1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001154.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611002823/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001154.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|title=''Guinn v.

The Court addressed the white primary system in a series of decisions later known as the "Texas primary cases". In ''[[Nixon v. Herndon]]'' (1927),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|273|536|1927}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon sued for damages under federal civil rights laws after being denied a ballot in a Democratic party primary election on the basis of race.

Following ''Nixon'', the Democratic Party's state convention instituted a rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in ''[[Grovey v. Townsend]]'' (1935), distinguishing the discrimination by a private organization from that of the state in the previous primary cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|295|45|1935}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001149.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611073002/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3425001149.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 11, 2014|title=''Grovey v.

After judicial enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment ended grandfather clauses, white primaries, and other discriminatory tactics, Southern black voter registration gradually increased, rising from five percent in 1940 to twenty-eight percent in 1960.&lt;ref name=Judicial/&gt; Although the Fifteenth Amendment was never interpreted to prohibit poll taxes, in 1962 the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fourth Amendment]] was adopted banning poll taxes in federal elections, and in 1966 the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Harper v.

Congress used its authority pursuant to Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment to pass the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], achieving further racial equality in voting. Sections 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act required states and local governments with histories of racial discrimination in voting to submit all changes to their voting laws or practices to the federal government for approval before they could take effect, a process called "preclearance". By 1976, sixty-three percent of Southern blacks were registered to vote, a figure only five percent less than that for Southern whites.&lt;ref name="Judicial" /&gt;

The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Sections 4 and 5 in ''[[South Carolina v. Katzenbach]]'' (1966). However, in ''[[Shelby County v. Holder]]'' (2013), the Supreme Court ruled that Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which established the coverage formula that determined which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance, was no longer constitutional and exceeded Congress's enforcement authority under Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment. The Court declared that the Fifteenth Amendment "commands that the right to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or color, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that command. The Amendment is not designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future."&lt;ref name="NYT20130625" /&gt; According to the Court, "Regardless of how to look at the record no one can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the 'pervasive', 'flagrant', 'widespread', and 'rampant' discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions from the rest of the nation." In dissent, Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] wrote, "Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/john-lewis-and-others-react-to-the-supreme-courts-voting-rights-act-ruling/2013/06/25/acb96650-ddda-11e2-b797-cbd4cb13f9c6_story.html "John Lewis and others react to the Supreme Court's Voting Rights Act ruling"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', June 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/12-96#writing-12-96_DISSENT_5|title=Shelby County, Alabama v.
