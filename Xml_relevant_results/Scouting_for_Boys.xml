'''''Scouting for Boys: A handbook for instruction in good citizenship''''' is a book on [[Scouting|Boy Scout]] training, published in various editions since 1908. Early editions were written and illustrated by [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] with later editions being extensively rewritten by others. The book was originally a manual for self-instruction in observation, tracking and [[woodcraft]] skills as well as  self-discipline and self-improvement, about the Empire and duty as citizens with an eclectic mix of anecdotes and unabashed personal observations and recollections. It is pervaded by a degree of moral proselytizing and references to the author's own exploits. It is based on his boyhood experiences, his experience with the [[Mafeking Cadet Corps]] during the [[Second Boer War]] at the [[Siege of Mafeking]], and on his experimental [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|camp on Brownsea Island]], England.

==History==
''Scouting for Boys'' (1908) was Baden-Powell's rewrite of his earlier book ''Aids to Scouting'' (1899)&lt;ref name="bp1899"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baden-Powell |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell |title=Aids to scouting for N.-C.Os. &amp; men |publisher=Gale &amp; Polden |date=1899 |location=London |oclc=316520848}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many youth training ideas openly taken from ''The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians'' (1906)&lt;ref name="seton1906"&gt;{{cite book |last=Seton |first=Ernest Thompson |authorlink=Ernest Thompson Seton |title=The birch-bark roll of the woodcraft Indians: containing their constitution, laws, games and deeds |url=https://archive.org/details/cihm_98785 |publisher=Doubleday |date=1906 |location=New York |oclc=150622085}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Ernest Thompson Seton]], who later became the Chief Scout of the Boy Scouts of America.&lt;ref name="arrow"&gt;{{cite web |title=First Scouting Handbook |publisher=Order of the Arrow, Boy Scouts of America |url=http://history.oa-bsa.org/node/3019 |accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="birch"&gt;{{cite web |title=Woodcraft Indians |publisher=Order of the Arrow, Boy Scouts of America |url=http://history.oa-bsa.org/node/3039 |accessdate=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aids to Scouting'' was mostly a written explanation of the military scouting and self-reliance skills lessons Baden-Powell had learned from [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], the British Army Chief of Scouts, but following the [[siege of Mafeking]] this military handbook unexpectedly became popular with many youth groups and educators, like [[Charlotte Mason]], in Britain.&lt;ref name="arrow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="masonaids"&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 |url=http://scoutguidehistoricalsociety.com/aids.htm |title=Aids to Scouting| publisher=Johnny Walker's Scouting Milestones |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="masonaids2"&gt;{{cite web |year=1937 |url=http://www.dshearer.fsbusiness.co.uk/sctfiles/bp_talks.htm |title=Be Prepared| publisher=DGS: Scouting, Interview from Listener magazine |accessdate=22 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120055426/http://www.dshearer.fsbusiness.co.uk/sctfiles/bp_talks.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=20 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Mafeking, Baden-Powell's adjutant had recruited and trained boys aged 12–15 as cadets and during the siege they acted as postmen, messengers, and later to carry the wounded, to free men for fighting. Upon his return to England, following the [[Second Boer War]], Baden-Powell learned some British schools had been using ''Aids to Scouting'' to teach [[observation]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]. In 1906, Seton discussed youth training ideas with Baden-Powell and shared with him a copy of ''The Birch Bark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians''.&lt;ref name="birch"/&gt; Soon after, Baden-Powell decided to revise ''Aids to Scouting'' into a book for boys.&lt;ref name="arrow"/&gt; Several friends supported Baden-Powell, including Sir [[William Alexander Smith (Boys' Brigade)|William Alexander Smith]], founder of the [[Boys' Brigade]], [[Cyril Arthur Pearson]], who owned newspapers and printing presses, and the novelist [[Maria Fetherstonhaugh]], who provided a quiet Wimbledon house where he could write.&lt;ref name="notestobook2004"&gt;{{cite book |first=Elleke |last=Boehmer |authorlink=Elleke Boehmer |title=Notes to 2004 edition |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=[[Oxford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wimbledonguardian.co.uk/news/10246444.Baden_Powell___Always_prepared/ ''Wimbledon Guardian'', 22 February 2013. Retrieved 4 November 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; Baden-Powell wrote a draft, then called ''Boy Patrols'', which he used and tested with 22 boys for one week at [[Brownsea Island Scout camp|camp on Brownsea Island]] in the summer of 1907, where Pearson's literary editor [[Percy Everett]] assisted.&lt;ref name="arrow"/&gt;

''Scouting for Boys'' was published in six fortnightly {{lang|en-GB|instalments}} of approximately 70 pages each, from January to March 1908. They were produced by Pearson's printer, Horace Cox. These six publications were a success and, as planned, were issued in book form on 1 May 1908. Although ''Aids to Scouting'' strongly influenced the book, ''Scouting for Boys'' presents Scouting from the perspective of outdoorsmen and explorers rather than military men, and it adds the Scout Oath, Scout Law, honours and games for youth.&lt;ref name="arrow"/&gt;&lt;ref name="birch"/&gt; The book was revised and an enormous variety of editions were published. Many of these editions were edited by others and, far beyond mere editing, whole sections were written by authors other than Baden-Powell. The book was a best seller upon release, and, in its various editions, is claimed to have become one of the best-selling books in history. ''Scouting for Boys'' has been translated into many languages. In 1948, editions of the book were still selling 50,000 copies annually. Only in 1967 was a decline noted by the publisher and in the last decades of the 20th century the book came to be seen as a period curiosity even by the Scout Movement.&lt;ref name="notestobook2004"/&gt; It is claimed to be the fourth bestselling book of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Smith | first = David | title = Scouts uncool?

Extrapolating this to 87 different language editions worldwide, historic world sales of ''Scouting for Boys'' can be estimated at 100 to 150 million copies since 1908.&lt;ref name='jeal'/&gt;&lt;ref name='censusdata'&gt;{{cite web | title =  UK and World Census figures | url = http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/library/history/census.htm | publisher = [[The Scout Association]] | accessdate = 2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her introduction to the 2005 edition, [[Elleke Boehmer]] criticises the book saying "the text was deeply scored through with a contemporary class prejudice which would have been off-putting to non-middle-class readers, as captured in the sharp aphorism that bees form a 'model community, for they respect their Queen and kill their unemployed' (p.117) Character observation in many ways meant reading for the signs of working-class poverty."&lt;ref&gt;[[Elleke Boehmer]] (ed), 2005, p.xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==
''Scouting for Boys'' has been published in over thirty consecutive editions by London based C. Arthur Pearson Ltd., and it is translated to all the major languages of the world. Estimatedly, over 100 million books have been printed, making it rank high in the [[list of best-selling books]].&lt;ref name="arrow"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extrapolation for global range of other language publications, and related to the number of Scouts, make a realistic estimate of 100 to 150 million books. Details from Jeal, Tim. Baden-Powell.

==Contents==
All parts of the six installments in 1908 have the title ''Scouting for Boys'' in big capitals. With a listed price of '[[old pence|4d]]. net', it was affordable to many boys, many of whom would have been at work, as the school-leaving age was 14. Authorship is attributed thus: 'by B-P (Lieut. Gen. Baden Powell C.B.)' (sic).

Most chapters start with hints to instructors. All chapters have [[campfire yarn]]s, appealing to boys, most contain sections with games and activities, and they close with recommendations for books to read.&lt;ref name=rohrer&gt;{{cite news | title = What would Baden-Powell do? | first = Finlo | last = Rohrer | work = [[BBC News Magazine]] | date = 27 July 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6918066.stm | accessdate = 2007-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
