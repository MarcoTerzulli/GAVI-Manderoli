The '''Hollywood Bowl''' is an [[amphitheatre]] in the [[Hollywood Hills]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles, California]]. It was named one of the 10 best live music venues in America by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 2018.&lt;ref name="RollingStone2018"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1 = Staff | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/10-best-live-music-venues-in-america-767070/first-ave-minneapolis-purple-rain-prince-767224/ |title= 10 Best Live Music Venues in America. From big rooms to intimate spaces, here's a selection of some of the country's best live music spots. |date= 13 December 2018|magazine= [[Rolling Stone Magazine]] |accessdate=23 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hollywood Bowl is known for its [[Shell (theater)|band shell]], a distinctive set of concentric [[arch]]es that graced the site from 1929 through 2003, before being replaced with a larger one beginning in the 2004 season. The shell is set against the backdrop of the [[Hollywood Hills]] and the famous [[Hollywood Sign]] to the northeast.

The "bowl" refers to the shape of the concave hillside the amphitheater is carved into. The Bowl is owned by [[Los Angeles County, California|the County of Los Angeles]] and is the home of the [[Hollywood Bowl Orchestra]], the summer home of the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]], and the host venue to hundreds of musical events each year.&lt;ref name="Hollywood Bowl History"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodbowl.com/about/bowl/hollywood-bowl-history/#1920s|title=Hollywood Bowl History|website=Hollywood Bowl|language=en|access-date=2019-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

It is located at 2301 North [[Highland Avenue (Los Angeles)|Highland Avenue]], west of the (former) French Village,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://paradiseleased.wordpress.com/2010/12/09/the-lost-french-village-of-hollywood/ |title = The Lost French Village of Hollywood|date = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://martinturnbull.com/2014/11/22/the-french-village-corner-of-highland-ave-cahuenga-blvd/&lt;/ref&gt; north of [[Hollywood Boulevard]] and the [[Hollywood/Highland (LACMTA station)|Hollywood/Highland subway station]], and south of [[Hollywood Freeway|Route 101]].

==History==

===Discovery and founding===
The site of the Hollywood Bowl was chosen in 1919 by William Reed and his son H. Ellis Reed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/la-as-subject/from-daisy-dell-to-the-hollywood-bowl-34638.html | title=From Daisy Dell to the Hollywood Bowl, a Little Musical History for Summer|publisher=Kcet.org|accessdate=18 January 2015| date=2011-06-23}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/885674119 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/885672800 cite #4 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template. [[User:GreenC bot/Job 18]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were dispatched to find a suitable location for outdoor performances by the members of the newly formed Theatre Arts Alliance headed by [[Christine Wetherill Stevenson]]. The Reeds selected a natural amphitheater, a shaded canyon and popular picnic spot known as 'Daisy Dell' in Bolton Canyon which was chosen for its natural acoustics and its proximity to downtown Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/history/la-as-subject/from-daisy-dell-to-the-hollywood-bowl-34638.html {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/885674119 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/885672800 cite #5 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template. [[User:GreenC bot/Job 18]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Community Park and Art Association, then headed by F.W. Blanchard, was the first organization to begin the building the Bowl.

One of the earliest performances at the Bowl was Hollywood High School's Performance of Shakespeare's ''Twelfth Night''. The Women's World Peace Concert was held on November 11, 1921. On November 11, 1921 the first Sunrise Service took place at the bowl, in one of its first major events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With the building of the first actual stage, consisting of little more than wooden platforms in and canvas, The Bowl officially opened on July 11, 1922.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodbowl.com/about/bowl/hollywood-bowl-history/|title=Hollywood Bowl History|website=Hollywood Bowl|language=en|access-date=2019-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

=== Community Function ===
The Bowl began as a community space rather than a privately owned establishment. Proceeds from the early events at the Bowl went to financing the construction of new elements of the bowl such as a stage and seating in 1922 and 1923 respectively. In 1924, a backdrop to the stage was added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodbowl.com/about/bowl/hollywood-bowl-history/|title=Hollywood Bowl History|website=Hollywood Bowl|language=en|access-date=2019-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early years of the Bowl's existence, concert tickets were kept at the lowest available price of 25 cents using the slogan ''popular prices will prevail'', coined by F.W. Blanchard. While serving as the venue for concerts by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Bowl also served as a community space, being used for Easter services, the Hollywood Community Chorus, as well as ''Young Artists Nights'' where younger musicians could perform well known classical music. Children were also invited to perform at community events with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Hollywood Community Chorus, beginning with Sibelius’ ''Finlandia'' in 1921.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Musical metropolis : Los Angeles and the creation of a music culture, 1880-1940|last=H.|first=Marcus, Kenneth|date=2004|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1403964181|location=New York|oclc=54543818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bowl was home to much more than western music, hosting a variety of Native American tribal events, as well as international music ensembles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

In 1924, the land was deeded to the County of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

=== Women in the Bowl ===
Many of the key influential figures in the founding of the Hollywood Bowl were women, most notably the pianist Artie Mason Carter, whose connections with the Los Angeles arts patrons were vital in the early days of the Bowls existence. Christine Wetherill Stevenson and Marie Rankin Clarke, who both donated $21,000 to purchase the land on which the bowl was built. E.J. Wakeman, Leiland Atherton Irish, Harriet Clay Penman, and composers Gertrude Ross and Carrie Jacobs Bond all contributed to the Bowl through fundraising drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Musical metropolis : Los Angeles and the creation of a music culture, 1880-1940|last=H.|first=Marcus, Kenneth|date=2004|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=1403964181|location=New York|oclc=54543818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Band shells===
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2015}}
Lloyd Wright designed the second and third band shells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-passages-homela-sowden-house-20190109-story.html|title=Lloyd Wright's Sowden House, possible Black Dahlia murder site, becomes a performance stage|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Carolina A.|last=Miranda|date=January 9, 2019|access-date=10 January 2019|quote=It’s a feature that makes sense given that Wright also designed one of the original band shells for the Hollywood Bowl.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original 1926 shell, designed by the Allied Architects group, was considered unacceptable both visually and acoustically. Wright's 1927 shell had a pyramidal shape and a design reminiscent of southwest American Indian architecture. Its acoustics generally were regarded as the best of any shell in Bowl history. But its appearance was considered too avant-garde, or perhaps only ugly, and it was demolished at the end of the season. His 1928 wooden shell had the now-familiar concentric ring motif, covered a 120-degree arc, and was designed to be easily dismantled. Unfortunately it was neglected and ruined by water damage.

[[File:Hollywood Bowl (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Hollywood Bowl's 1980s–2003 appearance, with the acoustic fiberglass spheres.]]
For the 1929 season, the Allied Architects built the shell that stood until 2003, using a [[transite]] skin over a metal frame. Its acoustics, though not nearly as good as those of the Lloyd Wright shells, were deemed satisfactory at first, and its clean lines and white, semicircular arches were copied for music shells elsewhere. As the acoustics deteriorated, various measures were used to mitigate the problems, starting in the 1970s with an inner shell made from large cardboard tubes (of the sort used as forms for round concrete pillars), which were replaced in the early 1980s by large fiberglass spheres (both designed by [[Frank Gehry]]&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg, Barbara. ''Conversations with Frank Gehry''. Knopf, 2009, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;) that remained until 2003. These dampened out the unfavorable [[acoustics]], but required massive use of electronic amplification to reach the full audience, particularly since the background noise level had risen sharply since the 1920s. The appearance underwent other, purely visual, changes as well, including the addition of a broad outer arch (forming a [[proscenium]]) where it had once had only a narrow rim, and a [[reflecting pool]] in front of the stage that lasted from 1953 till 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/about/history.cfm|title=Hollywood Bowl|publisher=Hollywoodbowl.com|accessdate=18 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722114340/http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/about/history.cfm|archive-date=22 July 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sculptor George Stanley, designer of the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] statuette, designed the Muse Fountain which has stood outside the Hollywood Bowl's main entrance since 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/about/history.cfm|title=Muse Fountain|publisher=Hollywoodbowl.com|accessdate=18 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722114340/http://www.hollywoodbowl.com/about/history.cfm|archive-date=22 July 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood Bowl Sculpture - Los Angeles CA - Living New Deal|url=https://livingnewdeal.org/projects/hollywood-bowl-sculpture-los-angeles-ca/|website=Living New Deal|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hollywood Bowl USGS (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The Hollywood Bowl in 2004, during construction of the new shell]]
[[Image:Hollywood Bowl 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Hollywood Bowl re-opening night, 2005]]
Shortly after the end of the 2003 summer season the 1929 shell was replaced with a new, somewhat larger, acoustically improved shell, which had its debut in the 2004 summer season. Preservationists fiercely opposed the demolition for many years, citing the shell's storied history. However, even when it was built, the 1929 shell was (at least acoustically) only the third-best shell in the Bowl's history, behind its two immediate predecessors. By the late 1970s, the Hollywood Bowl became an acoustic liability because of continued hardening of its transite skin. The new shell incorporates design elements of not only the 1929 shell, but of both the Lloyd Wright shells. During the 2004 summer season, the sound steadily improved, as engineers learned to work with its live acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.acentech.com/studio_a/hollywood.html | title=Hollywood Bowl Acoustics Project|publisher=Acentech.com|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current sound reinforcement system is a line-array configuration of multiple loudspeaker enclosures hung vertically in a curved manner, with the lower enclosures facing the front sections, and the upper enclosures angled towards the rear sections. It is manufactured by L'Acoustics, and includes state-of-the-art audio processing allowing each individual loudspeaker enclosure to be "tuned" and directed towards the near-precise location of the listener, regardless of where in the venue they are sitting. This results in the audience in the rear sections hearing the same audio, at the same level, as in the front sections. This electronic processing includes sound level, frequency equalization, occasional special effects, and time delay (sound passes through wire much faster than through air, therefore the sound coming from the speakers must be delayed, allowing the actual sound from the stage to "catch up" so both sources reach the listeners' ears simultaneously). The system is maintained by Rat Sound Systems, the same company that has provided audio for the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Festival]], since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.l-acoustics.com/en/hotnews/hotnewsfrom846/|title=Hollywood Bowl Enhances its L-Acoustics System with New Amplified Controllers|last=Don2yhatawe|website=L-Acoustics|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mixonline.com/recording/hollywood-bowl-unique-blend-natural-acoustics-and-amplified-sound-366566|title=The Hollywood Bowl: A Unique Blend of Natural Acoustics and Amplified Sound|last=Hurwitz|first=By Matt|website=Mixonline|language=en-us|access-date=2019-03-06|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=May 2015}}

The 2004 shell incorporates the prominent front arch of the 1926 shell, the broad profile of the 1928 shell, and the unadorned white finish (and most of the general lines) of the 1929 shell. In addition, the ring-shaped structure hung within the shell, supporting lights and acoustic clouds, echoes a somewhat similar structure hung within the 1927 shell. During the 2004 season, because the back wall was not yet finished, a white curtain was hung at the back; beginning with the 2005 season, the curtain was removed to reveal a finished back wall. The architectural design for the shell was developed by the Los Angeles-based architectural practice Hodgetts and Fung, with the structural concept developed by the local office of [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]].

At the same time the new shell was being constructed the bowl received four new video screens and towers. During most concerts, three remotely operated cameras in the shell, and a fourth, manually operated camera among the box seats, provide the audience with close-up views of the musicians.

== Hollywood Bowl Orchestra(s) ==
The Hollywood Bowl has had several house orchestras. A "Bowl Orchestra" performed in 1925, and a "Hollywood Bowl Orchestra" made a live recording in 1928. Later, the "Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra" recorded made several classical recordings under music director [[Leopold Stokowski]] from 1945 to 1946, and released a number of recordings on the Capitol Records label in the 1950s and 1960s.

The Hollywood Bowl Orchestra was re-launched by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Association in 1991 under principal conductor [[John Mauceri]], who finished his tenure in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodbowl.com/about/bowl/meet-the-orchestra/|title=Meet the Orchestra|website=Hollywood Bowl|language=en|access-date=2019-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From among the Orchestra's more than 300 concerts, [[Kathleen Battle]], [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Jane Eaglen]], [[Marilyn Horne]], [[Alexander Frey]], [[Jennifer Larmore]], [[Sylvia McNair]], [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Gil Shaham]], [[Stephen Hough]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]] and the San Francisco Ballet represent the illustrious talent from the worlds of opera, ballet and classical music that has graced the stage with the Orchestra. [[Trisha Yearwood]], [[Garth Brooks]] (in his only performance with an orchestra) and the late [[John Denver]] brought to their performances the irrepressible optimism of Country-Western. [[Jason Alexander]], [[Carol Burnett]], [[Kristin Chenoweth]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Patti LuPone]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[Lynn Redgrave]], [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Harry Connick Jr.]], [[Alan Cumming]], [[Davis Gaines]], [[Savion Glover]], [[Joel Grey]], [[Garrison Keillor]], [[Leonard Nimoy]], [[Brian Stokes Mitchell]] and [[Patrick Stewart]] have brought their inimitable gifts to the Bowl stage. Hosting [[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy]], [[Chicago]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[The Chieftains]], [[Sergio Mendes]], [[The Moody Blues]], [[Pink Martini]], [[Tito Puente]] and the [[Latin Jazz Ensemble]], [[Royal Crown Revue]], and [[Rufus Wainwright]], the Orchestra has proven itself in the world of pop and rock. [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Ann Miller]], [[Della Reese]], [[Sir George Martin]], and [[Peter, Paul &amp; Mary]] are among artists with whom the Orchestra has been privileged to work. And, in the 1999 season, John Mauceri stepped aside to allow the mayor of Los Angeles, the Honorable [[Richard J. Riordan]], to make his conducting debut at the Bowl with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra.

===Early Conductors===

The first appointed conductor of the Bowl ensemble was [[Emil Oberhoffer]], who served for one year.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} Oberhoffer was proceeded by [[Alfred Hertz]] for two years.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}} In 1925 [[Fritz Reiner]] migrated to the orchestra from the Cincinnati Symphony. Reiner was supplanted by Sir [[Henry Wood]] several years later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

== Early Ballet and Opera ==
Ballet dancer Maud Allen performed during the production of symphony ''Pathetique'' by Tschaikowsky under the direction of Alfred Hertz in 1926. Ernest Belcher arranged a ballet scene for ''Bowl Dedication Night,'' and dancers from the Belcher Ballet School performed the ''Beautiful Galatea,'' ''Enchanted Hour,'' and ''Venesive Festival''. In 1932, the Belcher's ballet was performed in Greek Costumes as a dedication to the Olympic-Games Athletes. Alexis and Theodore Kosloff performed the ballet Scheherazade with dancers from Hollywood and the Klosloff Dancing School between 1930s. In 1932, Theodore Klosloff performed the ''Flower''.Also in 1932, the ballet ''Chopiniana'' was performed. Ballet Dancers Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn performed solo dances under direction of Hertz in 1927. Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn raised there arms to point at the California Stars during the Russian Ballet ''sur le point'' at the Hollywood Bowl. In 1928, Andreas Pavley, a tenor, and Serge Oukrainsky, a ballet dancer, performed at the Hollywood Bowl. Oukrainsky performed in the ballet ''La Fete a Robinson'' alone after Pavley's death. In 1929, [[Norma Gould]] brought her Los Angeles dancers to the bowl to perform during Schubert's ''Unfinished Symphony'' and Tschaikowsky's ''Nut-Cracker Suite''. In August, 1930, Michio Ito brought five dancers to the Hollywood Bowl to perform in the Russian Ballet ''Prince Igor''. In 1931, Adolph Bolm performed at the Bowl for Debussy's ''Les Nuages''. He also performed ''The Spirt factory''. This was later called the Mechanical Ballet composed by Alaxander Mosolov. Dancers Elise Reiman and Robert Bell also performed in the Mechanical Ballet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hollywood Bowl|last=Jones|first=Isabel Morse|publisher=G.S Schirmer, Inc.|year=1936|isbn=|location=New York, NY Los Angeles, CA|pages=141–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, Los Angeles Grand opera performed segments of ''Marouf''. Early Hollywood Bowl appearances of opera include: ''Carmen,'' ''Aida'', and ''Shanewis''. In 1929, a concertized form of the opera ''Carmen'' was performed by Alice Genytle, Paul Althouse and Alexander Kisselburgh. The same cast later performed moments from the opera ''Tannhauser''. In 1932, ''Samson and Delilah'' was performed by Paul Althouse, local singers, the Belcher Ballet and the Civic Chorus in concert style. In 1927, Elsa Alsen performed ''Santuzza'' in ''Cavalleria''. In 1934,  Nina Koshetz performed Carmen and Nelson Eddy sang Escamillio in the opera ''Carmen''. Koshetz also sang the lead in Tschaikowsky's ''Eugene Oregon''. In the 1930s, Verdi's ''Aida'' was performed by Dan Gridley, Clemence Gifford, Eleanor Woodforde and Richard Bonelli with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1935, ''Lohengrin'' was performed by Jeanette Vreeland performing Elsa and Dan Gridley performing Lonhengrin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hollywood Bowl|last=Jones|first=Isabel Morse|publisher=G.S Schirmer, Inc.|year=1936|isbn=|location=New York, NY Los Angeles, CA|pages=158–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Leopold Stokowski formed the Hollywood Bowl Symphony Orchestra, drawing its players from among members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and various film studios orchestras. He made a number of 78 rpm recordings with them for RCA Victor during his two seasons there (1945–46) before returning to New York. The Hollywood Bowl Symphony's name was retained for a series of Capitol LPs made in the 1950s under such conductors as Felix Slatkin and Carmen Dragon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

In 1951, a financial crisis closed the Hollywood Bowl during its summer season. Dorothy Chandler chaired a committee that organized a series of fundraising concerts that was able to reopen it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Hollywood Bowl|url=https://www.hollywoodbowl.com/visit/hollywood-bowl-museum/timeline/1950s|website=Hollywood Bowl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film-and-orchestra concert [[Bugs Bunny on Broadway]], subsequently called "Bugs Bunny at the Symphony," has played the Hollywood Bowl a record 21 times—19 times with the Los Angeles Phiharmonic, and twice with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, all conducted by [[George Daugherty]].  In September 2003, "Bugs Bunny On Broadway" was the final Los Angeles Philharmonic concert to be performed in the 1929 shell before its demolition started the following day, making way for the new shell.

''Know Before You Go'' is provided as a detailed guide offering public transport information and free bike parking options. The Hollywood Bowl has waterless urinals and flush reducing toilets to preserve water as well as a satellite-based irrigation system to control water use.
