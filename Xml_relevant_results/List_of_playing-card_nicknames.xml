This '''list of playing card nicknames''' has some [[nickname]]s for the [[playing card]]s in a 52-card deck, as used in some common card games, such as [[poker]].
{{wiktionarycat|type=Poker|category=Poker}}

==Single cards==
The following is a list of nicknames used for playing cards used in most card games which use the standard 52-card pack. Such games usually require the revealing or announcement of held cards, at which point the nicknames may be used.

===One-eyed royals===
The phrase '''one-eyed royals''' is jargon referring to the three face cards showing only one eye: the Jack of Spades ({{cards|J♠}}), Jack of Hearts ({{cards|J♥}}) and King of Diamonds ({{cards|K♦}}). The terminology results from the depiction of the face on the card as being shown in profile, so only one eye is visible (all other face cards show two eyes). The jacks are also referred to, separately, as '''one-eyed jacks''': Jack of Spades ({{cards|J♠}}), Jack of Hearts ({{cards|J♥}}).

They are frequently used in home games of [[draw poker]] as wildcards. Because the King of Diamonds is the only king card bearing an axe (the others show swords), a common phrase for the one-eyed royals is "One-eyed Jacks, the Man with the Axe". Another common phrase is "One-eyed Jacks and Suicide King" denoting the King of Hearts ({{cards|K♥}}) bearing a sword through his head. These four cards are the only cards of differing rank and [[Suit (cards)|suit]] in a common [[Deck (cards)|deck]] that share an identifying trait.  Apart from the bedside Queen (of Spades), of course.   She is the only one with a symbol beside her which looks a little like an old-fashioned wooden bedpost.

==Texas hold 'em pocket card nicknames==
The following is a list of nicknames for pairs of two playing cards, usually hole cards, used in poker derivatives such as [[Texas hold 'em]] and [[Omaha hold 'em]] poker. These nicknames are usually used by the player when announcing their hand or by spectators or commentators who are watching the game.

&lt;!-- ENTRIES SHOULD ALL BE ALPHABETICAL --&gt;

|Presto||There is debate as to where this term originated. The most commonly accepted source of the nickname is that many years ago, before Rec.gambling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/rec.gambling.poker/topics|title=Google Groups|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was split into several groups, followers of the group who were [[blackjack]] players were fond of saying "Presto!" as they turned up a 21.  This became a sign of recognition of fellow travelers. Around this time (circa 1991), the World Rec Gambling Poker Tournament(WRGPT), of which the first few were played slowly over email, came into being.  During WRGPT2(92-93), the attribution of pocket fives as the "Presto Hand" was made by the player Howard Simonson, after using pocket fives to knock out several players from the tournament some number of times. [If a copy of the table-talk from WRGPT2 can be found and cited, this can be absolutely confirmed]  Consequently, the term stuck among the rec.gambling minions, and has become a common poker term today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup

&lt;/ref&gt; There is also suggestion that the hand won more often than it should due to a computer glitch.&lt;ref name="xanadu"/&gt;
However, there is a counter-argument that there used to be a club in London called the Presto Club. The address was 55 [[Victoria, London|Victoria Street]], London. Therefore, whenever someone was dealt 55 in hold'em, they'd say they were dealt "Presto", because of the club's street address. When English players played events worldwide, the word spread, and it caught on everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup

# It was the playing card used by [[John Dalrymple, 1st Earl of Stair|Sir John Dalrymple]], the [[Earl of Stair]], to cryptically authorise the [[Massacre of Glencoe|Glencoe Massacre]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Certainly there is a resemblance between the nine of diamonds and his coat of arms.
# [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland|The Duke of Cumberland]] is supposed to have scribbled the order for "no quarter" to be given after the [[Battle of Culloden]] on a nine of diamonds playing card.
# It has also been suggested that it is a misreading of the "Corse of Scotland" i.e., the "[[Flag of Scotland|Cross of Scotland]]" or [[Saint Andrew|St Andrew's]] [[Saltire]]. There is a resemblance between the pattern of the nine of diamonds and the Saltire.
# Nine diamonds were at one time stolen from the [[crown of Scotland]] and a tax was levied on the Scottish people to pay for them – the tax got the nickname "The Curse of Scotland".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
# The game of Comète being introduced by [[Mary of Guise|Mary of Lorraine]] (alternatively by [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]]) into the court at [[Holyrood Palace|Holyrood]], the Nine of Diamonds, being the winning card, got this name in consequence of the number of courtiers ruined by it.
# In the [[Pope Joan (card game)|game of Pope Joan]], the Nine of Diamonds is the Pope – a personage whom some Scottish [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] consider as a curse.
# Diamonds imply royalty and every ninth [[List of Scottish monarchs|king of Scotland]] was a curse to his country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
