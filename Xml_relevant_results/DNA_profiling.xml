'''DNA profiling''' (also called '''DNA fingerprinting''') is the process of determining an individual's [[DNA]] characteristics. DNA analysis intended to identify a species, rather than an individual, is called [[DNA barcoding]].

DNA profiling is a [[Forensic science|forensic]] technique in [[criminal investigation]]s, comparing criminal suspects' profiles to DNA evidence so as to assess the likelihood of their involvement in the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Erin|date=2017-10-13|title=Forensic DNA Typing|journal=Annual Review of Criminology|volume=1|pages=497–515|doi=10.1146/annurev-criminol-032317-092127|issn=2572-4568}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used in [[parentage testing]],&lt;ref&gt;Petersen, K., J..

DNA profiling has also been used in the study of animal and plant populations in the fields of zoology, botany, and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=Geoffrey K.|last2=Curtis|first2=Caitlin|last3=Millar|first3=Craig D.|last4=Huynen|first4=Leon|last5=Lambert|first5=David M.|date=2014-01-01|title=DNA fingerprinting in zoology: past, present, future|journal=Investigative Genetics|volume=5|issue=1|page=3|doi=10.1186/2041-2223-5-3|issn=2041-2223|pmc=3909909|pmid=24490906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Starting in the 1980s scientific advances allowed for the use of DNA as a material for the identification of an individual.  The first patent covering the direct use of DNA variation for forensics was filed by [[Jeffrey Glassberg|Dr. Jeffrey Glassberg]] in 1983, based upon work he had done while at Rockefeller University in 1981.  In the [[United Kingdom]], Geneticist Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tautz D | authorlink = Diethard Tautz | year = 1989 | title = Hypervariability of simple sequences as a general source for polymorphic DNA markers | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 17 | issue = 16| pages = 6463–6471 | doi=10.1093/nar/17.16.6463| pmid = 2780284 | pmc = 318341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patent Jäckle H &amp; Tautz D (1989) "Process For Analyzing Length Polymorphisms in DNA Regions" europäische Patent Nr. 0 438 512&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/may/24/dna-fingerprinting-alec-jeffreys Eureka moment that led to the discovery of DNA fingerprinting | Science | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://investigativegenetics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-2223-4-21 The man behind the DNA fingerprints: an interview with Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys | Investigative Genetics | Full Text&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; independently developed a DNA profiling process in beginning in late 1984&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/may/24/dna-fingerprinting-alec-jeffreys|title=Eureka moment that led to the discovery of DNA fingerprinting|last=|first=|date=24 May 2009|work=The Observer|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; while working in the Department of Genetics at the [[University of Leicester]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/genetics/jeffreys Alec Jeffreys and Genetic Fingerprinting – University of Leicester&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The process, developed by Jeffreys in conjunction with Peter Gill and Dave Werrett of the [[Forensic Science Service]] (FSS), was first used forensically in the solving of the murder of two teenagers who had been raped and murdered in [[Narborough, Leicestershire]] in 1983 and 1986. In the murder inquiry, led by Detective [[David Baker (detective)|David Baker]], the DNA contained within blood samples obtained voluntarily from around 5,000 local men who willingly assisted [[Leicestershire Police|Leicestershire Constabulary]] with the investigation, resulted in the exoneration of a man who had confessed to one of the crimes, and the subsequent conviction of [[Colin Pitchfork]]. Pitchfork, a local bakery employee, had coerced his coworker Ian Kelly to stand in for him when providing a blood sample—Kelly then used a forged passport to impersonate Pitchfork. Another coworker reported the deception to the police. Pitchfork was arrested, and his blood was sent to Jeffrey's lab for processing and profile development. Pitchfork's profile matched that of DNA left by the murderer which confirmed Pitchfork's presence at both crime scenes; he pleaded guilty to both murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Evans |first=Colin |title=The Casebook of Forensic Detection: How Science Solved 100 of the World's Most Baffling Crimes |year=2007 |origyear=1998|publisher=Berkeley Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4406-2053-9 |edition=2nd |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=adKcM055ERoC&amp;pg=PT86 86–89]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although 99.9% of human DNA sequences are the same in every person, enough of the DNA is different that it is possible to distinguish one individual from another, unless they are [[monozygotic twins|monozygotic (identical) twins]].&lt;ref name="Lander"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BA/Use_of_DNA_Identification.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426014318/http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BA/Use_of_DNA_Identification.php |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-04-26 |title=Use of DNA in Identification |publisher=Accessexcellence.org |accessdate=2010-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA profiling uses repetitive sequences that are highly variable,&lt;ref name="Lander"/&gt; called [[variable number tandem repeat]]s (VNTRs), in particular short tandem repeats (STRs), also known as [[microsatellite]]s, and [[minisatellite]]s. VNTR [[locus (genetics)|loci]] are similar between closely related individuals, but are so variable that unrelated individuals are unlikely to have the same VNTRs.

In India DNA fingerprinting was started by Dr. VK Kashyap and Dr. [[Lalji Singh]]. Singh was an Indian scientist who worked in the field of DNA fingerprinting technology in India, where he was popularly known as the "Father of Indian DNA fingerprinting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lalji Singh, 'father of DNA fingerprinting in India,' passes away|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/lalji-singh-father-of-dna-fingerprinting-in-india-passes-away/article21389954.ece|work=The Hindu|agency=PTI|date=11 December 2017|language=en-IN|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321152655/http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/lalji-singh-father-of-dna-fingerprinting-in-india-passes-away/article21389954.ece|archivedate=21 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Profiling processes==
[[Image:D1S80Demo.png|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Variations of [[VNTR]] allele lengths in 6 individuals.&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Alec Jeffreys -2008.jpg|thumb|[[Alec Jeffreys]], a pioneer of DNA profiling.]]
The process, developed by [[Jeffrey Glassberg|Glassberg]] and independently by [[Alec Jeffreys|Jeffreys]], begins with a sample of an individual's DNA (typically called a "reference sample"). Reference samples are usually collected through a [[buccal swab]]. When this is unavailable (for example, when a court order is needed but unobtainable) other methods may be needed to collect a sample of [[blood]], [[saliva]], [[semen]], [[vaginal lubrication]], or other fluid or tissue from personal use items (for example, a toothbrush, razor) or from stored samples (for example, banked [[spermatozoon|sperm]] or [[biopsy]] tissue). Samples obtained from blood relatives can indicate an individual's profile, as could previous profiled human remains.  A reference sample is then analyzed to create the individual's DNA profile using one of the techniques discussed below.  The DNA profile is then compared against another sample to determine whether there is a genetic match.

=== [[DNA extraction]] ===
When a sample such as blood or saliva is obtained, the DNA is only a small part of what is present in the sample. Before the DNA can be analyzed, it must be [[DNA extraction|extracted]] from the cells and purified. There are many ways this can be accomplished, but all methods follow the same basic procedure. The cell and nuclear membranes need to be broken up to allow the DNA to be free in solution. Once the DNA is free, it can be separated from all other cellular components. After the DNA has been separated in solution, the remaining cellular debris can then be removed from the solution and discarded, leaving only DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/dna-extraction|title=DNA Extraction – an overview &amp;#124; ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common methods of DNA extraction include [[Phenol-chloroform extraction|organic extraction]] (also called phenol chloroform extraction), [[Chelex 100|Chelex extraction]], and [[solid phase extraction]]. [[Differential extraction]] is a modified version of extraction in which DNA from two different types of cells can be separated from each other before being purified from the solution. Each method of extraction works well in the laboratory, but analysts typically selects their preferred method based on factors such as the cost, the time involved, the quantity of DNA yielded, and the quality of DNA yielded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forensic DNA typing : biology, technology, and genetics of STR markers|last=1969-|first=Butler, John M. (John Marshall)|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|isbn=9780080470610|edition= 2nd|location=Amsterdam|oclc=123448124}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the DNA is extracted from the sample, it can be analyzed, whether it is by RFLP analysis or quantification and PCR analysis.

===RFLP analysis===
{{Main|Restriction fragment length polymorphism}}
The first methods for finding out genetics used for DNA profiling involved '''RFLP analysis'''. DNA is collected from cells and cut into small pieces using a [[restriction enzyme]] (a restriction digest). This generates DNA fragments of differing sizes as a consequence of variations between DNA sequences of different individuals. The fragments are then separated on the basis of size using [[gel electrophoresis]].

The separated fragments are then transferred to a [[nitrocellulose]] or nylon filter; this procedure is called a [[Southern blot]]. The DNA fragments within the blot are permanently fixed to the filter, and the DNA strands are [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denatured]]. [[Radiolabeled]] probe molecules are then added that are complementary to sequences in the [[genome]] that contain repeat sequences. These repeat sequences tend to vary in length among different individuals and are called [[variable number tandem repeat]] sequences or VNTRs. The probe molecules [[Nucleic acid hybridization|hybridize]] to DNA fragments containing the repeat sequences and excess probe molecules are washed away. The blot is then exposed to an X-ray film. Fragments of DNA that have bound to the probe molecules appear as fluorescent bands on the film.

The Southern blot technique requires large amounts of non-degraded sample DNA. Also, Alec Jeffreys' original multilocus RFLP technique looked at many [[minisatellite]] loci at the same time, increasing the observed variability, but making it hard to discern individual [[allele]]s (and thereby precluding [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]]). These early techniques have been supplanted by [[PCR]]-based [[assay]]s.

===Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis===
{{Main|Polymerase chain reaction}}
Developed by [[Kary Mullis]] in 1983, a process was reported by which specific portions of the sample DNA can be amplified almost indefinitely (Saiki et al. 1985, 1985) The process, [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), mimics the biological process of [[DNA replication]], but confines it to specific DNA sequences of interest. With the invention of the PCR technique, DNA profiling took huge strides forward in both discriminating power and the ability to recover information from very small (or degraded) starting samples.

PCR greatly amplifies the amounts of a specific region of DNA. In the PCR process, the DNA sample is denatured into the separate individual [[polynucleotide]] strands through heating. Two [[oligonucleotide]] DNA [[primer (molecular biology)|primers]] are used to hybridize to two corresponding nearby sites on opposite DNA strands in such a fashion that the normal enzymatic extension of the active terminal of each primer (that is, the [[Directionality (molecular biology)#3′-end|3’ end]]) leads toward the other primer. PCR uses replication enzymes that are tolerant of high temperatures, such as the thermostable [[Taq polymerase]]. In this fashion, two new copies of the sequence of interest are generated. Repeated denaturation, hybridization, and extension in this fashion produce an exponentially growing number of copies of the DNA of interest. Instruments that perform thermal cycling are readily available from commercial sources. This process can produce a million-fold or greater amplification of the desired region in 2 hours or less.

Early [[assay]]s such as the [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]]-[[HLA-DQA1|DQ alpha]] [[Allele specific oligonucleotide|reverse]] [[dot blot]] strips grew to be very popular owing to their ease of use, and the speed with which a result could be obtained. However, they were not as discriminating as RFLP analysis. It was also difficult to determine a DNA profile for mixed samples, such as a vaginal swab from a [[sexual assault]] victim.

However, the PCR method was readily adaptable for analyzing [[VNTR]], in particular [[Short tandem repeat|STR]] loci. In recent years, research in human DNA quantitation has focused on new "real-time" quantitative PCR (qPCR) techniques. Quantitative PCR methods enable automated, precise, and high-throughput measurements. Inter-laboratory studies have demonstrated the importance of human DNA quantitation on achieving reliable interpretation of STR typing and obtaining consistent results across laboratories.

===STR analysis===
{{Main|Short tandem repeats}}
The system of DNA profiling used today is based on [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) and uses simple sequences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tautz D. | authorlink = Diethard Tautz | year = 1989 | title = Hyper-variability of simple sequences as a general source for polymorphic DNA markers | url = | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 17 | issue = 16| pages = 6463–6471 | doi=10.1093/nar/17.16.6463| pmid = 2780284 | pmc = 318341 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or short tandem repeats (STR). This method uses highly [[Gene polymorphism|polymorphic]] regions that have short repeated sequences of DNA (the most common is 4 bases repeated, but there are other lengths in use, including 3 and 5 bases). Because unrelated people almost certainly have different numbers of repeat units, STRs can be used to discriminate between unrelated individuals. These STR [[locus (genetics)|loci]] (locations on a [[chromosome]]) are targeted with sequence-specific primers and amplified using PCR. The DNA fragments that result are then separated and detected using [[electrophoresis]]. There are two common methods of separation and detection, [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) and gel electrophoresis.

Each STR is polymorphic, but the number of [[allele]]s is very small. Typically each STR allele will be shared by around 5–20% of individuals. The power of STR analysis derives from inspecting multiple STR loci simultaneously. The pattern of alleles can identify an individual quite accurately. Thus STR analysis provides an excellent identification tool. The more STR regions that are tested in an individual the more discriminating the test becomes.

From country to country, different STR-based DNA-profiling systems are in use. In North America, systems that amplify the [[CODIS]] 20&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/services/laboratory/biometric-analysis/codis|title=Combined DNA Index System (CODIS)|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; core loci are almost universal, whereas in the United Kingdom the [[DNA-17]] 17 loci system (which is compatible with The [[National DNA Database]]) is in use, and Australia uses 18 core markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/from-the-crime-scene-to-the-courtroom-the-journey-of-a-dna-sample-82250|title=From the crime scene to the courtroom: the journey of a DNA sample|last=Curtis|first=Caitlin|date=August 29, 2017|work=The Conversastion|access-date=October 14, 2017|last2=Hereward|first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whichever system is used, many of the STR regions used are the same. These DNA-profiling systems are based on [[Multiplex polymerase chain reaction|multiplex reactions]], whereby many STR regions will be tested at the same time.

The true power of [[STR analysis]] is in its statistical power of discrimination. Because the 20 loci that are currently used for discrimination in CODIS are [[independent assortment|independently assorted]] (having a certain number of repeats at one locus does not change the likelihood of having any number of repeats at any other locus), the [[Bayes' theorem#Bayes' theorem derived via conditional probabilities|product rule for probabilities]] can be applied. This means that, if someone has the DNA type of ABC, where the three loci were independent, then the probability of that individual having that DNA type is the probability of having type A times the probability of having type B times the probability of having type C. This has resulted in the ability to generate match probabilities of 1 in a quintillion (1x10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;) or more. However, DNA database searches showed much more frequent than expected false DNA profile matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Felch|first = Jason|title = FBI resists scrutiny of 'matches'|newspaper = Los Angeles Times|pages = P8|date = July 20, 2008|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/20/local/me-dna20|accessdate =March 18, 2010 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, since there are about 12 million [[monozygotic twins]] on Earth, the theoretical probability is not accurate.

In practice, the risk of contaminated-matching is much greater than matching a distant relative, such as contamination of a sample from nearby objects, or from left-over cells transferred from a prior test. The risk is greater for matching the most common person in the samples: Everything collected from, or in contact with, a victim is a major source of contamination for any other samples brought into a lab. For that reason, multiple control-samples are typically tested in order to ensure that they stayed clean, when prepared during the same period as the actual test samples. Unexpected matches (or variations) in several control-samples indicates a high probability of contamination for the actual test samples. In a relationship test, the full DNA profiles should differ (except for twins), to prove that a person was not actually matched as being related to their own DNA in another sample.

===AFLP===
{{Main|Amplified fragment length polymorphism}}

Another technique, AFLP, or [[amplified fragment length polymorphism]] was also put into practice during the early 1990s. This technique was also faster than RFLP analysis and used [[PCR]] to amplify DNA samples. It relied on [[variable number tandem repeat]] (VNTR) polymorphisms to distinguish various alleles, which were separated on a [[polyacrylamide gel]] using an allelic ladder (as opposed to a molecular weight ladder). Bands could be visualized by [[silver staining]] the gel. One popular focus for fingerprinting was the D1S80 locus. As with all PCR based methods, highly degraded DNA or very small amounts of DNA may cause allelic dropout (causing a mistake in thinking a heterozygote is a homozygote) or other stochastic effects. In addition, because the analysis is done on a gel, very high number repeats may bunch together at the top of the gel, making it difficult to resolve. AmpFLP analysis can be highly automated, and allows for easy creation of [[phylogenetic]] trees based on comparing individual samples of DNA. Due to its relatively low cost and ease of set-up and operation, AmpFLP remains popular in lower income countries.

===DNA family relationship analysis===

Using [[PCR]] technology, DNA analysis is widely applied to determine genetic family relationships such as paternity, maternity, siblingship and other [[kinship]]s.

During conception, the father's sperm cell and the mother's egg cell, each containing half the amount of DNA found in other body cells, meet and fuse to form a fertilized egg, called a [[zygote]]. The zygote contains a complete set of DNA molecules, a unique combination of DNA from both parents. This zygote divides and multiplies into an embryo and later, a full human being.

At each stage of development, all the cells forming the body contain the same DNA—half from the father and half from the mother. This fact allows the relationship testing to use all types of all samples including loose cells from the cheeks collected using buccal swabs, blood or other types of samples.

There are predictable inheritance patterns at certain locations (called loci) in the human genome, which have been found to be useful in determining identity and biological relationships. These loci contain specific DNA markers that scientists use to identify individuals. In a routine DNA paternity test, the markers used are [[short tandem repeats]] (STRs), short pieces of DNA that occur in highly differential repeat patterns among individuals.

Each person's DNA contains two copies of these markers—one copy inherited from the father and one from the mother. Within a population, the markers at each person's DNA location could differ in length and sometimes sequence, depending on the markers inherited from the parents.

The combination of marker sizes found in each person makes up their unique genetic profile. When determining the relationship between two individuals, their genetic profiles are compared to see if they share the same inheritance patterns at a statistically conclusive rate.

For example, the following sample report from this commercial DNA paternity testing laboratory Universal Genetics signifies how relatedness between parents and child is identified on those special markers:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! DNA marker
! Mother
! Child
! Alleged father
|-
| D21S11
| 28, 30
| 28, 31.2
| 29, 31.2
|-
| D7S820
| 9, 10
| 10, 11
| 11, 12
|-
| TH01
| 6, 9.3
| 9, 9.3
| 8, 9
|-
| D13S317
| 10, 12
| 12, 13
| 11, 13
|-
| D19S433
| 14, 16.2
| 14, 15
| 14.2, 15
|}

The partial results indicate that the child and the alleged father's DNA match among these five markers. The complete test results show this correlation on 16 markers between the child and the tested man to enable a conclusion to be drawn as to whether or not the man is the biological father.

Each marker is assigned with a Paternity Index (PI), which is a statistical measure of how powerfully a match at a particular marker indicates paternity. The PI of each marker is multiplied with each other to generate the Combined Paternity Index (CPI), which indicates the overall probability of an individual being the biological father of the tested child relative to a randomly selected man from the entire population of the same race. The CPI is then converted into a Probability of Paternity showing the degree of relatedness between the alleged father and child.

The DNA test report in other family relationship tests, such as grandparentage and siblingship tests, is similar to a paternity test report. Instead of the Combined Paternity Index, a different value, such as a Siblingship Index, is reported.

The report shows the genetic profiles of each tested person. If there are markers shared among the tested individuals, the probability of biological relationship is calculated to determine how likely the tested individuals share the same markers due to a blood relationship.

===Y-chromosome analysis===
Recent innovations have included the creation of primers targeting polymorphic regions on the Y-chromosome ([[Y-STR]]), which allows resolution of a mixed DNA sample from a male and female or cases in which a [[differential extraction]] is not possible. Y-chromosomes are paternally inherited, so Y-STR analysis can help in the identification of paternally related males. Y-STR analysis was performed in the [[Jefferson-Hemings controversy]] to determine if [[Thomas Jefferson]] had sired a son with one of his slaves.

The analysis of the Y-chromosome yields weaker results than autosomal chromosome analysis with regard to individual identification. The Y male sex-determining chromosome, as it is inherited only by males from their fathers, is almost identical along the paternal line. On the other hand, the Y-STR [[Haplotype#Y-DNA_haplotypes_from_genealogical_DNA_tests|haplotype]] provides powerful genealogical information as a patrilinear relationship can be traced back over many generations.

Furthermore, due to the paternal inheritance, Y-haplotypes provide information about the genetic ancestry of the male population. To investigate this population history, and to provide estimates for haplotype frequencies in criminal casework, the "Y haplotype reference database (YHRD)" has been created in 2000 as an online resource. It currently comprises more than 300,000 minimal (8 locus) haplotypes from world-wide populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://yhrd.org |title=Y haplotype reference database |accessdate=2020-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mitochondrial analysis===
{{Main|Mitochondrial DNA}}

For highly degraded samples, it is sometimes impossible to get a complete profile of the 13 CODIS STRs. In these situations, [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) is sometimes typed due to there being many copies of mtDNA in a cell, while there may only be 1–2 copies of the nuclear DNA. Forensic scientists amplify the HV1 and HV2 regions of the mtDNA, and then sequence each region and compare single-nucleotide differences to a reference. Because mtDNA is maternally inherited, directly linked maternal relatives can be used as match references, such as one's maternal grandmother's daughter's son. In general, a difference of two or more nucleotides is considered to be an exclusion. [[Heteroplasmy]] and poly-C differences may throw off straight sequence comparisons, so some expertise on the part of the analyst is required. mtDNA is useful in determining clear identities, such as those of missing people when a maternally linked relative can be found. mtDNA testing was used in determining that [[Anna Anderson]] was not the Russian princess she had claimed to be, [[Anastasia Romanov]].

mtDNA can be obtained from such material as hair shafts and old bones/teeth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ravikumar|first=Dhanalakshmi|last2=Gurunathan|first2=Deepa|last3=Gayathri|first3=R|last4=Priya|first4=V Vishnu|last5=Geetha|first5=R V|date=2018-01-01|title=DNA profiling of Streptococcus mutans in children with and without black tooth stains: A polymerase chain reaction analysis|url=https://doaj.org/article/d03de98b62944e3fb3e9eac391b4e76c|journal=Dental Research Journal|language=en|volume=15|issue=5|pages=334|doi=10.4103/1735-3327.240472|issn=1735-3327|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control mechanism based on interaction point with data.

==Issues with forensic DNA samples==
When people think of DNA analysis they often think about shows like NCIS or CSI, which portray DNA samples coming into a lab and then instantly analyzed, followed by pulling up a picture of the suspect within minutes⁠. The true reality, however, is quite different and perfect DNA samples are often not collected from the scene of a crime. Homicide victims are frequently left exposed to harsh conditions before they are found and objects used to commit crimes have often been handled by more than one person. The two most prevalent issues that forensic scientists encounter when analyzing DNA samples are degraded samples and DNA mixtures.

===Degraded DNA===

In the real world DNA labs often have to deal with DNA samples that are less than ideal. DNA samples taken from crime scenes are often degraded, which means that the DNA has started to break down into smaller fragments [[DNA fragmentation]]. Victims of homicides might not be discovered right away, and in the case of a mass casualty event it could be hard to get DNA samples before the DNA has been exposed to degradation elements.

Degradation or fragmentation of DNA at crime scenes can occur because of a number of reasons, with environmental exposure often being the most common cause. Biological samples that have been exposed to the environment can get degraded by water and enzymes called  [[nuclease]]s. Nucleases essentially ‘chew’ up the DNA into fragments over time and are found everywhere in nature.

Before modern PCR methods existed it was almost impossible to analyze degraded DNA samples. Methods like restriction fragment length polymorphism or RFLP [[Restriction fragment length polymorphism]], which was the first technique used for DNA analysis in forensic science, required high molecular weight DNA in the sample in order to get reliable data. High molecular weight DNA however is something that is lacking in degraded samples, as the DNA is too fragmented to accurately carry out RFLP. It wasn't until modern day PCR techniques were invented that analysis of degraded DNA samples were able to be carried out [[Polymerase chain reaction]]. Multiplex PCR in particular made it possible to isolate and amplify the small fragments of DNA still left in degraded samples. When multiplex PCR methods are compared to the older methods like RFLP a vast difference can be seen. Multiplex PCR can theoretically amplify less than 1&amp;nbsp;ng of DNA, while RFLP had to have a least 100&amp;nbsp;ng of DNA in order to carry out an analysis.&lt;ref name="Forensic DNA Typing"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Forensic DNA Typing |date=2001 |publisher=Academic Press |location=Chapter 7 |pages=99–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of a forensic approach to a degraded DNA sample, STR loci [[STR analysis]] are often amplified using PCR-based methods. Though STR loci are amplified with greater probability of success with degraded DNA, there is still the possibility that larger STR loci will fail to amplify, and therefore, would likely yield a partial profile, which results in reduced statistical weight of association in the event of a match.

====MiniSTR Analysis====

In instances where DNA samples are degraded, like in the case of intense fires or if all that remains are bone fragments, standard STR testing on these samples can be inadequate.  When standard STR testing is done on highly degraded samples the larger STR loci often drop out, and only partial DNA profiles are obtained. While partial DNA profiles can be a powerful tool, the random match probabilities will be larger than if a full profile was obtained.  One method that has been developed in order to analyse degraded DNA samples is to use miniSTR technology. In this new approach, primers are specially designed to bind closer to the STR region.&lt;ref name="Coble 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coble |first1=Michael D. |last2=Butler |first2=John M. |title=Characterization of New MiniSTR Loci to Aid Analysis of Degraded DNA |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |date=January 2005 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=43–53 |doi=10.1520/JFS2004216|pmid=15830996 |url=https://strbase.nist.gov/pub_pres/Coble2005miniSTR.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In normal STR testing the primers will bind to longer sequences that contain the STR region within the segment. MiniSTR analysis however will just target the STR location, and this results in a DNA product that is much smaller.&lt;ref name="Coble 2005" /&gt;

By placing the primers closer to the actual STR regions, there is a higher chance that successful amplification of this region will occur. Successful amplification of these STR regions can now occur and more complete DNA profiles can be obtained.  The success that smaller PCR products produce a higher success rate with highly degraded samples was first reported in 1995, when miniSTR technology was used to identify victims of the Waco fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitaker |first1=JP |last2=Clayton |first2=TM |last3=Millican |first3=ES |last4=Downes |first4=TJ |last5=Kimpton |first5=CP |title=Short tandem Repeat typing of bodies from a mass disaster: high success rate and characteristic amplification patterns in highly degraded samples |journal=BioTechniques |date=1995 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=670–677|pmid=7598902}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case the fire at destroyed the DNA samples so badly that normal STR testing did not result in a positive ID on some of the victims.

===DNA Mixtures===
Mixtures are another common issue that forensic scientists face when they are analyzing unknown or questionable DNA samples. A mixture is defined as a DNA sample that contains two or more individual contributors.&lt;ref name="Forensic DNA Typing"/&gt; This can often occur when a DNA sample is swabbed from an item that is handled by more than one person or when a sample contains both the victim and assailants' DNA. The presence of more than one individual in a DNA sample can make it challenging to detect individual profiles, and interpretation of mixtures should only be done by highly trained individuals. Mixtures that contain two or three individuals can be interpreted, though it will be difficult. Mixtures that contain four or more individuals are much too convoluted to get individual profiles. One common scenario in which a mixture is often obtained is in the case of sexual assault. A sample may be collected that contains material from the victim, the victim's consensual sexual partners, and the perpetrator(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weir |first1=BS |last2=Triggs |first2=CM |last3=Starling |first3=L |last4=Stowell |first4=LI |last5=Walsh |first5=KA |last6=Buckleton |first6=J |title=Interpreting DNA Mixtures |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |date=1997 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=213–222 |doi=10.1520/JFS14100J |url=https://projects.nfstc.org/workshops/resources/articles/Interpreting%20DNA%20Mixtures.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As detection methods in DNA profiling advance, forensic scientists are seeing more DNA samples that contain mixtures, as even the smallest contributor is now able to be detected by modern tests. The ease in which forensic scientists have in interpenetrating DNA mixtures largely depends on the ratio of DNA present from each individual, the genotype combinations, and total amount of DNA amplified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=John |title=Forensic DNA Typing |date=2001 |publisher=Academic Press |location=Chapter 7 |pages=99–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA ratio is often the most important aspect to look at in determining whether a mixture can be interpreted. For example, in the case where a DNA sample had two contributors, it would be easy to interpret individual profiles if the ratio of DNA contributed by one person was much higher than the second person. When a sample has three or more contributors, it becomes extremely difficult to determine individual profiles. Fortunately, advancements in probabilistic genotyping could make this sort of determination possible in the future. [[Probabilistic genotyping]] uses complex computer software to run through thousands of mathematical computations in order to produce statistical likelihoods of individual genotypes found in a mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Indiana State Police Laboratory |title=Introduction to STRmix and Likelifood Ratios |url=https://www.in.gov/isp/labs/files/STRmix_and_Likelihood_Ratios_IPAC%20and_Defense_Council_Training_2017.pdf |website=In.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Probabilistic genotyping software that are often used in labs today include STRmix and [[TrueAllele]].

==DNA databases==
{{Main|National DNA database}}
An early application of a [[DNA database]] was the compilation of a Mitochondrial DNA Concordance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Kevin|title=Mitochondrial DNA Concordance |publisher=University of Cambridge – Biological Anthropology

P. Miller and John L. Dawson at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1996 to 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=K.W.P.|author2=Dawson, J.L. |author3=Hagelberg, E. |title=A concordance of nucleotide substitutions in the first and second hypervariable segments of the human mtDNA control region|journal=International Journal of Legal Medicine|year=1996|volume=109|issue=3|pages=107–113|doi=10.1007/bf01369668|pmid=8956982}}&lt;/ref&gt; from data collected as part of Miller's PhD thesis. There are now several [[DNA database]]s in existence around the world. Some are private, but most of the largest databases are government-controlled. The [[United States]] maintains the largest [[DNA database]], with the [[Combined DNA Index System]] (CODIS) holding over 13 million records as of May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/services/laboratory/biometric-analysis/codis/ndis-statistics |title=CODIS&amp;nbsp;– National DNA Index System |publisher=Fbi.gov |accessdate=2010-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306181537/http://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/codis/national.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]] maintains the [[United Kingdom National DNA Database|National DNA Database]] (NDNAD), which is of similar size, despite the UK's smaller population. The size of this database, and its rate of growth, are giving concern to [[civil liberties]] groups in the UK, where police have wide-ranging powers to take samples and retain them even in the event of acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Identification_by_body_samples_and_impressions#Section_82:_Restrictions_on_use_and_destruction_of_fingerprints_and_samples |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223205051/http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Identification_by_body_samples_and_impressions#Section_82:_Restrictions_on_use_and_destruction_of_fingerprints_and_samples |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-02-23 |title=Restrictions on use and destruction of fingerprints and samples |publisher=Wikicrimeline.co.uk |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2010-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition partially addressed these concerns with part 1 of the [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]], under which DNA samples must be deleted if suspects are acquitted or not charged, except in relation to certain (mostly serious and/or sexual) offenses. Public discourse around the introduction of advanced forensic techniques (such as genetic genealogy using public genealogy databases and DNA phenotyping approaches) has been limited, disjointed, unfocused, and raises issues of privacy and consent that may warrant the establishment of additional legal protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Caitlin|last2=Hereward|first2=James|last3=Mangelsdorf|first3=Marie|last4=Hussey|first4=Karen|last5=Devereux|first5=John|date=18 December 2018|title=Protecting trust in medical genetics in the new era of forensics|journal=[[Genetics in Medicine]]|volume=21|issue=7|pages=1483–1485|doi=10.1038/s41436-018-0396-7|pmid=30559376|pmc=6752261|url=https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:f122f7b/Protectingtrust.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[USA PATRIOT Act|U.S. Patriot Act]] of the United States provides a means for the U.S. government to get DNA samples from suspected terrorists. DNA information from crimes is collected and deposited into the [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]] database, which is maintained by the [[FBI]]. CODIS enables law enforcement officials to test DNA samples from crimes for matches within the database, providing a means of finding specific biological profiles associated with collected DNA evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/2003/olrdata/jud/rpt/2003-R-0411.htm|title=DNA Testing Provisions in Patriot Act|first1=Susan |last1=Price-Livingston|date=5 June 2003|access-date=18 January 2018|publisher=[[Connecticut General Assembly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a match is made from a national DNA databank to link a crime scene to an offender having provided a DNA sample to a database, that link is often referred to as a ''cold hit''. A cold hit is of value in referring the police agency to a specific suspect but is of less evidential value than a DNA match made from outside the DNA Databank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=DNA: A Practical Guide|authors=Rose &amp; Goos|url=https://store.thomsonreuters.ca/product-detail/dna-a-practical-guide-print-proview-online/|publisher=[[Carswell Publications]]|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FBI agents cannot legally store DNA of a person not convicted of a crime. DNA collected from a suspect not later convicted must be disposed of and not entered into the database. In 1998, a man residing in the UK was arrested on accusation of burglary. His DNA was taken and tested, and he was later released. Nine months later, this man's DNA was accidentally and illegally entered in the DNA database. New DNA is automatically compared to the DNA found at cold cases and, in this case, this man was found to be a match to DNA found at a rape and assault case one year earlier. The government then prosecuted him for these crimes. During the trial the DNA match was requested to be removed from the evidence because it had been illegally entered into the database. The request was carried out.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/double-helix-jeopardy | title=Double Helix Jeopardy | work=[[IEEE Spectrum]] | date=August 1, 2007 | accessdate=June 6, 2019 | author=Cole, Simon A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The DNA of the perpetrator, collected from victims of rape, can be stored for years until a match is found. In 2014, to address this problem, Congress extended a bill that helps states deal with "a backlog" of evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congress OKs bill to cut rape evidence backlog |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CONGRESS_RAPE_BACKLOG_BILL?SITE=NHCON&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2014-09-18-18-43-47 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140919001749/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CONGRESS_RAPE_BACKLOG_BILL?SITE=NHCON&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2014-09-18-18-43-47 |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 September 2014 |work=Associated Press |accessdate=18 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations when evaluating DNA evidence==
As DNA profiling became a key piece of evidence in the court, defense lawyers based their arguments on statistical reasoning. For example: Given a match that had a 1 in 5 million probability of occurring by chance, the lawyer would argue that this meant that in a country of say 60 million people there were 12 people who would also match the profile. This was then translated to a 1 in 12 chance of the suspect's being the guilty one. This argument is not sound unless the suspect was drawn at random from the population of the country. In fact, a jury should consider how likely it is that an individual matching the genetic profile would also have been a suspect in the case for other reasons. Also, different DNA analysis processes can reduce the amount of DNA recovery if the procedures are not properly done. Therefore, the number of times a piece of evidence is sampled can
diminish the DNA collection efficiency. Another spurious statistical argument is based on the false assumption that a 1 in 5 million probability of a match automatically translates into a 1 in 5 million probability of innocence and is known as the [[prosecutor's fallacy]].

When using [[RFLP]], the theoretical risk of a coincidental match is 1 in 100 billion (100,000,000,000), although the practical risk is actually 1 in 1000 because [[monozygotic twins]] are 0.2% of the human population.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Moreover, the rate of laboratory error is almost certainly higher than this, and often actual laboratory procedures do not reflect the theory under which the coincidence probabilities were computed. For example, the coincidence probabilities may be calculated based on the probabilities that markers in two samples have bands in ''precisely'' the same location, but a laboratory worker may conclude that similar—but not precisely identical—band patterns result from identical genetic samples with some imperfection in the agarose gel. However, in this case, the laboratory worker increases the coincidence risk by expanding the criteria for declaring a match. Recent studies have quoted relatively high error rates, which may be cause for concern.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Paton Walsh [https://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,2763,640157,00.html False result fear over DNA tests] [[The Observer]], Sunday 27 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of genetic fingerprinting, the necessary population data to accurately compute a match probability was sometimes unavailable. Between 1992 and 1996, arbitrary low ceilings were controversially put on match probabilities used in RFLP analysis rather than the higher theoretically computed ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook/0309053951/html/35.html The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence] 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, RFLP has become widely disused due to the advent of more discriminating, sensitive and easier technologies.

Since 1998, the DNA profiling system supported by The National DNA Database in the UK is the [[SGM+]] DNA profiling system that includes 10 STR regions and a sex-indicating test. [[Short tandem repeat|STRs]] do not suffer from such subjectivity and provide similar power of discrimination (1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; for unrelated individuals if using a full [[SGM+]] profile). Figures of this magnitude are not considered to be statistically supportable by scientists in the UK; for unrelated individuals with full matching DNA profiles a match probability of 1 in a billion is considered statistically supportable. However, with any DNA technique, the cautious juror should not convict on genetic fingerprint evidence alone if other factors raise doubt. Contamination with other evidence (secondary transfer) is a key source of incorrect DNA profiles and raising doubts as to whether a sample has been adulterated is a favorite defense technique. More rarely, [[chimerism]] is one such instance where the lack of a genetic match may unfairly exclude a suspect.

===Evidence of genetic relationship===
It is possible to use DNA profiling as evidence of genetic relationship, although such evidence varies in strength from weak to positive. Testing that shows no relationship is absolutely certain. Further, while almost all individuals have a single and distinct set of genes, ultra-rare individuals, known as "[[chimera (genetics)|chimeras]]", have at least two different sets of genes. There have been two cases of DNA profiling that falsely suggested that a mother was unrelated to her children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2315693 |title=Two Women Don't Match Their Kids' DNA |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2006-08-15 |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happens when two eggs are fertilized at the same time and fuse together to create one individual instead of twins.

==Fake DNA evidence==
In one case, a criminal planted fake DNA evidence in his own body: [[John Schneeberger]] raped one of his sedated patients in 1992 and left semen on her underwear. Police drew what they believed to be Schneeberger's blood and compared its DNA against the crime scene semen DNA on three occasions, never showing a match. It turned out that he had surgically inserted a [[Penrose drain]] into his arm and filled it with foreign blood and [[anticoagulant]]s.

The functional analysis of genes and their coding sequences ([[open reading frames]] [ORFs]) typically requires that each ORF be expressed, the encoded protein purified, antibodies produced, phenotypes examined, intracellular localization determined, and interactions with other proteins sought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 11076863|pmc = 310948|year = 2000|last1 = Hartley|first1 = J.

Nucleix claims they can also prove the difference between non-altered DNA and any that was synthesized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/414782/how-dna-evidence-can-be-falsified/ | title=A new test distinguishes between real and fake genetic evidence | work=[[MIT Technology Review]] | date=August 17, 2009 | accessdate=June 6, 2019 | author=Singer, Emily }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the [[Phantom of Heilbronn]], police detectives found DNA traces from the same woman on various crime scenes in Austria, Germany, and France—among them murders, burglaries and robberies. Only after the DNA of the "woman" matched the DNA sampled from the burned body of a ''male'' asylum seeker in France did detectives begin to have serious doubts about the DNA evidence. It was eventually discovered that DNA traces were already present on the [[cotton swab]]s used to collect the samples at the crime scene, and the swabs had all been produced at the same factory in Austria. The company's product specification said that the swabs were guaranteed to be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterile]], but not DNA-free.

===Familial DNA searching===
Familial DNA searching (sometimes referred to as "familial DNA" or "familial DNA database searching") is the practice of creating new investigative leads in cases where DNA evidence found at the scene of a crime (forensic profile) strongly resembles that of an existing DNA profile (offender profile) in a state DNA database but there is not an exact match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/diane-dimond/searching-the-family-dna-_b_845340.html|title = Searching the Family DNA Tree to Solve Crime|date = April 12, 2011|accessdate = April 17, 2011|website = HuffPost Denver|publisher = The Huffington Post|last = Diamond|first = Diane|authorlink = Diane Diamond|type = Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Bieber Frederick|year = 2006|title = Finding Criminals Through DNA of Their Relatives|journal = Science|volume = 312|issue = 5778|pages = 1315–1316|doi = 10.1126/science.1122655|display-authors = etal|pmid=16690817|url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/a68f970997180b0cb82a37331b1ab06665670f60}}{{Closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; After all other leads have been exhausted, investigators may use specially developed software to compare the forensic profile to all profiles taken from a state's DNA database to generate a list of those offenders already in the database who are most likely to be a very close relative of the individual whose DNA is in the forensic profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dnaforensics.com/FamilialSearches.aspx|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101107011011/http://dnaforensics.com/FamilialSearches.aspx|url-status = dead|archive-date = November 7, 2010|title = Familial searches allows law enforcement to identify criminals through their family members|accessdate = December 7, 2015|website = DNA Forensics|last = Staff|at = United Kingdom – A Pioneer in Familial Searches}}&lt;/ref&gt; To eliminate the majority of this list when the forensic DNA is a man's, crime lab technicians conduct [[Y-STR]] analysis. Using standard investigative techniques, authorities are then able to build a family tree. The family tree is populated from information gathered from [[public records]] and criminal justice records. Investigators rule out family members' involvement in the crime by finding excluding factors such as sex, living out of state or being incarcerated when the crime was committed. They may also use other leads from the case, such as [[witness]] or victim statements, to identify a suspect. Once a suspect has been identified, investigators seek to legally obtain a DNA sample from the suspect. This suspect DNA profile is then compared to the sample found at the crime scene to definitively identify the suspect as the source of the crime scene DNA.

Familial DNA database searching was first used in an investigation leading to the conviction of Jeffrey Gafoor of the [[murder of Lynette White]] in the United Kingdom on 4 July 2003. DNA evidence was matched to Gafoor's nephew, who at 14 years old had not been born at the time of the murder in 1988. It was used again in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn4908-killer-convicted-thanks-to-relatives-dna/|title = Killer convicted thanks to relative's DNA|last = Bhattacharya|first = Shaoni|date = April 20, 2004|journal = [[New Sci.|New Scientist]]|doi = |pmid = |access-date = April 17, 2011|department = Daily News}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; to find a man who threw a brick from a motorway bridge and hit a lorry driver, killing him.

At a press conference in Virginia on March 7, 2011, regarding the [[East Coast Rapist]], Prince William County prosecutor Paul Ebert and Fairfax County Police Detective John Kelly said the case would have been solved years ago if Virginia had used familial DNA searching. Aaron Thomas, the suspected East Coast Rapist, was arrested in connection with the rape of 17 women from Virginia to Rhode Island, but familial DNA was not used in the case.&lt;ref&gt;Christoffersen, John and Barakat, Matthew.

Critics of familial DNA database searches argue that the technique is an invasion of an individual's [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Murphy Erin Elizabeth | year = 2009 | title = Relative Doubt: Familial Searches of DNA Databases | url = http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/109/3/murphy.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101201110255/http://www.michiganlawreview.org/assets/pdfs/109/3/murphy.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2010-12-01 | journal = Michigan Law Review | volume = 109 | pages = 291–348 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Privacy advocates are petitioning for DNA database restrictions, arguing that the only fair way to search for possible DNA matches to relatives of offenders or arrestees would be to have a population-wide DNA database.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Some scholars have pointed out that the privacy concerns surrounding familial searching are similar in some respects to other police search techniques,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Suter Sonia | year = 2010 | title = All in The Family: Privacy and DNA Familial Searching | url = http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v23.2/23HarvJLTech309.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110607082902/http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v23.2/23HarvJLTech309.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2011-06-07 | journal = Harvard Journal of Law and Technology | volume = 23 | page = 328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and most have concluded that the practice is constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Kaye, David H., (2013). [https://archive.today/20140725210336/http://ssrn.com/abstract=2043091 "The Genealogy Detectives: A Constitutional Analysis of Familial Searching"] American Criminal Law Review, Vol. 51, No. 1, 109–163, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in ''United States v. Pool'' (vacated as moot) suggested that this practice is somewhat analogous to a witness looking at a photograph of one person and stating that it looked like the perpetrator, which leads law enforcement to show the witness photos of similar looking individuals, one of whom is identified as the perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2010/09/14/09-10303.pdf "US v. Pool"] Pool 621F .3d 1213.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether familial DNA searching was the method used to identify the suspect, authorities always conduct a normal DNA test to match the suspect's DNA with that of the DNA left at the crime scene.

Critics also claim that racial profiling could occur on account of familial DNA testing. In the United States, the conviction rates of racial minorities are much higher than that of the overall population. It is unclear whether this is due to discrimination from police officers and the courts, as opposed to a simple higher rate of offence among minorities. Arrest-based databases, which are found in the majority of the United States, lead to an even greater level of racial discrimination. An arrest, as opposed to conviction, relies much more heavily on police discretion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

For instance, investigators with Denver District Attorney's Office successfully identified a suspect in a property theft case using a familial DNA search. In this example, the suspect's blood left at the scene of the crime strongly resembled that of a current [[Colorado Department of Corrections]] prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;Pankratz, Howard.[http://www.denverpost.com/denver/ci_13801125 "Denver Uses 'Familial DNA Evidence' to Solve Car Break-Ins"]. ''The Denver Post'', accessed April 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Using publicly available records, the investigators created a family tree. They then eliminated all the family members who were incarcerated at the time of the offense, as well as all of the females (the crime scene DNA profile was that of a male). Investigators obtained a court order to collect the suspect's DNA, but the suspect actually volunteered to come to a police station and give a DNA sample. After providing the sample, the suspect walked free without further interrogation or detainment. Later confronted with an exact match to the forensic profile, the suspect pleaded guilty to criminal trespass at the first court date and was sentenced to two years probation.

In Italy a familiar DNA search has been done to solve the case of the [[murder of Yara Gambirasio]] whose body was found in the bush{{clarify|reason=in ''a'' bush, or in the country? The latter is Australian slang, doesn't normally apply to Italy|date=August 2017}} three months after her disappearance. A DNA trace was found on the underwear of the murdered teenage near and a DNA sample was requested from a person who lived near the municipality of [[Brembate di Sopra]] and a common male ancestor was found in the DNA sample of a young man not involved in the murder. After a long investigation the father of the supposed killer was identified as Giuseppe Guerinoni, a deceased man, but his two sons born from his wife were not related to the DNA samples found on the body of Yara. After three and a half years the DNA found on the underwear of the deceased girl was matched with Massimo Giuseppe Bossetti who was arrested and accused of the murder of the 13-year-old girl. In the summer of 2016 Bossetti was found guilty and sentenced to life by the [[Corte d'assise]] of Bergamo.

===Partial matches===
Partial DNA matches are the result of moderate stringency CODIS searches that produce a potential match that shares at least one [[allele]] at every [[locus (genetics)|locus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090718171602/http://www.chromosomal-labs.com/files/FindingCriminals.pdf "Finding Criminals Through DNA Testing of Their Relatives"] Technical Bulletin, Chromosomal Laboratories, Inc. accessed April 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Partial matching does not involve the use of familial search software, such as those used in the UK and United States, or additional [[Y-STR]] analysis, and therefore often misses sibling relationships. Partial matching has been used to identify suspects in several cases in the UK and United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverda.org/DNA/Familial_DNA_Database_Searches.htm "Denver District Attorney DNA Resources"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324020014/http://www.denverda.org/dna/Familial_DNA_Database_Searches.htm |date=2011-03-24 }} accessed April 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been used as a tool to exonerate the falsely accused. [[Darryl Hunt]] was wrongly convicted in connection with the rape and murder of a young woman in 1984 in North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070828152727/http://www.innocenceproject.org/news/Blog-Search.php?check=true&amp;tag=134 "Darryl Hunt, The Innocence Project"].&lt;/ref&gt; Hunt was exonerated in 2004 when a DNA database search produced a remarkably close match between a convicted felon and the forensic profile from the case. The partial match led investigators to the felon's brother, Willard E. Brown, who confessed to the crime when confronted by police. A judge then signed an order to dismiss the case against Hunt.
In Italy, partial matching has been used in the controversial [[murder of Yara Gambirasio]], a child found dead about a month after her presumed kidnapping. In this case, the partial match has been used as the only incriminating element against the defendant, Massimo Bossetti, who has been subsequently condemned for the murder (waiting appeal by the Italian Supreme Court).

===Surreptitious DNA collecting===
Police forces may collect DNA samples without a suspect's knowledge, and use it as evidence. The legality of the practice has been questioned in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://aic.gov.au/publications/tandi/tandi26|title=The forensic use of DNA profiling|last=Patricia Weiser Easteal|first=Simon Easteal|date=2017-11-03|website=Australian Institute of Criminology|language=en|access-date=2019-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, it has been accepted, courts often ruling that there is no [[expectation of privacy]], citing ''[[California v. Greenwood]]'' (1988), in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] held that the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] does not prohibit the [[Search warrant|warrantless]] search and seizure of [[Waste|garbage]] left for collection outside the [[curtilage]] of a [[home]]. Critics of this practice underline that this analogy ignores that "most people have no idea that they risk surrendering their genetic identity to the police by, for instance, failing to destroy a used coffee cup. Moreover, even if they do realize it, there is no way to avoid abandoning one's DNA in public."&lt;ref&gt;[[Amy Harmon]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/science/03dna.html "Lawyers Fight DNA Samples Gained on Sly"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Maryland v. King]]'' (2013) that DNA sampling of prisoners arrested for serious crimes is constitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Supreme Court allows DNA sampling of prisoners|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2013/06/03/US-Supreme-Court-allows-DNA-sampling-of-prisoners/UPI-45601370271128/#ixzz2VBFXuZve|publisher=UPI|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-207_d18e.pdf|title=Supreme Court of the United States – Syllabus: Maryland v.

In the [[UK]], the ''[[Human Tissue Act 2004]]'' prohibits private individuals from covertly collecting biological samples (hair, fingernails, etc.) for DNA analysis, but exempts medical and criminal investigations from the prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080306151453/http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Scientificdevelopmentgeneticsandbioethics/Tissue/TissueGeneralInformation/DH_4102169 Human Tissue Act 2004], UK, available in PDF.&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge must also ensure that the jury does not confuse the match probability (the probability that a person that is chosen at random has a matching DNA profile to the sample from the scene) with the probability that a person with matching DNA committed the crime.

{{quote|Members of the Jury, if you accept the scientific evidence called by the Crown, this indicates that there are probably only four or five white males in the United Kingdom from whom that semen stain could have come. The Defendant is one of them. If that is the position, the decision you have to reach, on all the evidence, is whether you are sure that it was the Defendant who left that stain or whether it is possible that it was one of that other small group of men who share the same DNA characteristics.}}

Juries should weigh up conflicting and corroborative evidence, using their own common sense and not by using mathematical formulae, such as [[Bayes' theorem]], so as to avoid "confusion, misunderstanding and misjudgment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII

====Presentation and evaluation of evidence of partial or incomplete DNA profiles====
In ''R v Bates'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = R v Bates | link =  | country =  | court = EWCA | division = Crim | year = 2006 | num = 1395 | para =  | eucase =  | parallelcite =  | date = 7 July 2006 | courtname = [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] | juris = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore-Bick LJ said:

{{quote|We can see no reason why partial profile DNA evidence should not be admissible provided that the jury are made aware of its inherent limitations and are given a sufficient explanation to enable them to evaluate it. There may be cases where the match probability in relation to all the samples tested is so great that the judge would consider its probative value to be minimal and decide to exclude the evidence in the exercise of his discretion, but this gives rise to no new question of principle and can be left for decision on a case by case basis. However, the fact that there exists in the case of all partial profile evidence the possibility that a "missing" allele might exculpate the accused altogether does not provide sufficient grounds for rejecting such evidence. In many there is a possibility (at least in theory) that evidence that would assist the accused and perhaps even exculpate him altogether exists, but that does not provide grounds for excluding relevant evidence that is available and otherwise admissible, though it does make it important to ensure that the jury are given sufficient information to enable them to evaluate that evidence properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=DNA_profiling#Presentation_and_evaluation_of_evidence_of_partial_or_incomplete_DNA_profiles |title=WikiCrimeLine DNA profiling |publisher=Wikicrimeline.co.uk |accessdate=2010-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022013511/http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=DNA_profiling#Presentation_and_evaluation_of_evidence_of_partial_or_incomplete_DNA_profiles |archivedate=2010-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Development of artificial DNA===
In August 2009, scientists in [[Israel]] raised serious doubts concerning the use of DNA by law enforcement as the ultimate method of identification. In a paper published in the journal ''Forensic Science International: Genetics'', the Israeli researchers demonstrated that it is possible to manufacture DNA in a laboratory, thus falsifying DNA evidence. The scientists fabricated saliva and blood samples, which originally contained DNA from a person other than the supposed donor of the blood and saliva.&lt;ref name="pollack"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/18/science/18dna.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|title=DNA Evidence Can Be Fabricated, Scientists Show|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|date=August 18, 2009|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researchers also showed that, using a DNA database, it is possible to take information from a profile and manufacture DNA to match it, and that this can be done without access to any actual DNA from the person whose DNA they are duplicating. The synthetic DNA oligos required for the procedure are common in molecular laboratories.&lt;ref name="pollack"/&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted the lead author, Daniel Frumkin, saying, "You can just engineer a crime scene ... any biology undergraduate could perform this".&lt;ref name="pollack"/&gt; Frumkin perfected a test that can differentiate real DNA samples from fake ones. His test detects [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] modifications, in particular, [[DNA methylation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1186/s41935-018-0042-1|title = Crime investigation through DNA methylation analysis: Methods and applications in forensics| journal=Egyptian Journal of Forensic Sciences| volume=8|year = 2018|last1 = Rana|first1 = Ajay Kumar|doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy percent of the DNA in any human genome is methylated, meaning it contains [[methyl group]] modifications within a [[CpG dinucleotide]] context. Methylation at the promoter region is associated with gene silencing. The synthetic DNA lacks this [[epigenetic]] modification, which allows the test to distinguish manufactured DNA from genuine DNA.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;

It is unknown how many police departments, if any, currently use the test. No police lab has publicly announced that it is using the new test to verify DNA results.&lt;ref name="frumkin"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.fsigenetics.com/article/S1872-4973(09)00099-4/abstract |title=Authentication of forensic DNA samples |journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=95–103 |accessdate=2010-04-03|doi=10.1016/j.fsigen.2009.06.009 |pmid=20129467 |year=2010 |last1=Frumkin |first1=Dan |last2=Wasserstrom |first2=Adam |last3=Davidson |first3=Ariane |last4=Grafit |first4=Arnon |citeseerx=10.1.1.179.2718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cases===
* In 1986, Richard Buckland was exonerated, despite having admitted to the rape and murder of a teenager near [[Leicester]], the city where DNA profiling was first developed.

* In 1988, [[Timothy Wilson Spencer]] was the first man in [[Virginia]] to be sentenced to death through DNA testing, for several rape and murder charges. He was dubbed "The South Side Strangler" because he killed victims on the south side of Richmond, Virginia. He was later charged with rape and first-degree murder and was sentenced to death. He was executed on April 27, 1994. David Vasquez, initially convicted of one of Spencer's crimes, became the first man in [[United States|America]] exonerated based on DNA evidence.
* In 1989, [[Chicago]] man [[Gary Dotson]] was the first person whose conviction was overturned using DNA evidence.
* In 1991, [[Allan Legere]] was the first [[Canadians|Canadian]] to be convicted as a result of DNA evidence, for four murders he had committed while an escaped prisoner in 1989. During his trial, his defense argued that the relatively shallow gene pool of the region could lead to false positives.
* In 1992, DNA evidence was used to prove that [[Nazism|Nazi]] doctor [[Josef Mengele]] was buried in [[Brazil]] under the name Wolfgang Gerhard.
* In 1992, DNA from a palo verde tree was used to convict Mark Alan Bogan of murder. DNA from seed pods of a tree at the crime scene was found to match that of seed pods found in Bogan's truck.

* In 1993, [[Kirk Bloodsworth]] was the first person to have been convicted of [[murder]] and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]], whose conviction was overturned using DNA evidence.
* The 1993 rape and murder of [[Mia Zapata]], lead singer for the Seattle punk band [[The Gits]], was unsolved nine years after the murder. A database search in 2001 failed, but the killer's DNA was collected when he was arrested in Florida for burglary and domestic abuse in 2002.
* The science was made famous in the [[United States]] in 1994 when prosecutors heavily relied on DNA evidence allegedly linking [[O. J. Simpson]] to a [[O. J. Simpson murder case|double murder]]. The case also brought to light the laboratory difficulties and handling procedure mishaps that can cause such evidence to be significantly doubted.
* In 1994, [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) detectives successfully tested hairs from a cat known as [[Snowball the Cat|Snowball]], and used the test to link a man to the murder of his wife, thus marking for the first time in forensic history the use of non-human animal DNA to identify a criminal (plant DNA was used in 1992, see above).
* In 1994, the claim that [[Anna Anderson]] was [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]] was tested after her death using samples of her tissue that had been stored at a Charlottesville, Virginia hospital following a medical procedure. The tissue was tested using DNA fingerprinting, and showed that she bore no relation to the [[Romanovs]].&lt;ref&gt;Identification of the remains of the Romanov family by DNA analysis by Peter Gill, Central Research and Support Establishment, Forensic Science Service, Aldermaston, Reading, Berkshire, RG7 4PN, UK, Pavel L.

* In 1994, [[Earl Washington, Jr.]], of Virginia had his death sentence commuted to life imprisonment a week before his scheduled execution date based on DNA evidence. He received a full pardon in 2000 based on more advanced testing.&lt;ref name = DNA&gt;Murnaghan, Ian, (28 December 2012) [http://www.exploredna.co.uk/famous-trials-dna-testing.html Famous Trials and DNA Testing; Earl Washington Jr.] Explore DNA, Retrieved 13 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His case is often cited by opponents of the [[death penalty]].
* In 1995, the British [[Forensic Science Service]] carried out its first mass intelligence DNA screening in the investigation of the [[Murder of Naomi Smith|Naomi Smith]] murder case.
* In 1998, [[Richard J. Schmidt]] was convicted of attempted second-degree murder when it was shown that there was a link between the [[viral DNA]] of the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) he had been accused of injecting in his girlfriend and viral DNA from one of his patients with AIDS. This was the first time viral DNA fingerprinting had been used as evidence in a criminal trial.
* In 1999, Raymond Easton, a disabled man from [[Swindon]], England, was arrested and detained for seven hours in connection with a burglary. He was released due to an inaccurate DNA match. His DNA had been retained on file after an unrelated domestic incident some time previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1933724,00.html |title = Suspect Nation |newspaper = The Guardian |date = 2006-10-08|location=London|first=Stuart|last=Jeffries|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2000 Frank Lee Smith was proved innocent by DNA profiling of the murder of an eight-year-old girl after spending 14 years on death row in Florida, USA. However he had died of cancer just before his innocence was proven.&lt;ref&gt;(June 2012) [http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3644 Frank Lee Smith] The University of Michigan Law School, National Registry of Exonerations, Retrieved 13 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In view of this the Florida state governor ordered that in future any death row inmate claiming innocence should have DNA testing.&lt;ref name = DNA/&gt;
* In May 2000 Gordon Graham murdered Paul Gault at his home in [[Lisburn]], Northern Ireland. Graham was convicted of the murder when his DNA was found on a sports bag left in the house as part of an elaborate ploy to suggest the murder occurred after a burglary had gone wrong. Graham was having an affair with the victim's wife at the time of the murder. It was the first time Low Copy Number DNA was used in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sunday-life/news/freedom-in-bag-for-killer-graham-13906320.html |title=Freedom in bag for killer Graham? |first=Stephen |last=Gordon |publisher=Belfasttelegraph.co.uk |date=2008-02-17 |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2001, Wayne Butler was convicted for the murder of [[Murder of Celia Douty|Celia Douty]]. It was the first murder in [[Australia]] to be solved using DNA profiling.&lt;ref name="telegraphuk"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/1322624/18-years-on%2C-man-is-jailed-for-murder-of-Briton-in-%27paradise%27.html |title=18 years on, man is jailed for murder of Briton in 'paradise' |last=Dutter|first=Barbie|date=2001-06-19 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=2008-06-17|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1195029.htm |title=DNA evidence may not be infallible: experts |last=McCutcheon |first=Peter |date=2004-09-08 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=2008-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211012018/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2004/s1195029.htm |archive-date=2009-02-11 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2002, the body of [[James Hanratty]], hanged in 1962 for the "A6 murder", was exhumed and DNA samples from the body and members of his family were analysed.  The results convinced [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] judges that Hanratty's guilt, which had been strenuously disputed by campaigners, was proved "beyond doubt".&lt;ref name="Rozenberg"&gt;Joshua Rozenberg,[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1393842/DNA-proves-Hanratty-guilt-%27beyond-doubt%27.html "DNA proves Hanratty guilt 'beyond doubt{{'"}}], ''Daily Telegraph'', London, 11 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Foot and some other campaigners continued to believe in Hanratty's innocence and argued that the DNA evidence could have been contaminated, noting that the small DNA samples from items of clothing, kept in a police laboratory for over 40 years "in conditions that do not satisfy modern evidential standards", had had to be subjected to very new amplification techniques in order to yield any genetic profile.&lt;ref&gt;John Steele, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1315138/Hanratty-lawyers-reject-DNA-guilt.html "Hanratty lawyers reject DNA 'guilt{{'"}}], ''Daily Telegraph'', London, 23 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; However, no DNA other than Hanratty's was found on the evidence tested, contrary to what would have been expected had the evidence indeed been contaminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | journal=BBC News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/1980731.stm | date=10 May 2002 | title=Hanratty: The damning DNA | accessdate=2011-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2002, DNA testing was used to exonerate [[Douglas Echols]], a man who was wrongfully convicted in a 1986 rape case. Echols was the 114th person to be exonerated through post-conviction DNA testing.
* In August 2002, Annalisa Vincenzi was shot dead in [[Tuscany]]. Bartender Peter Hamkin, 23, was arrested, in [[Merseyside]] in March 2003 on an extradition warrant heard at [[Bow Street Magistrates' Court]] in [[London]] to establish whether he should be taken to [[Italy]] to face a murder charge. DNA "proved" he shot her, but he was cleared on other evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2766289.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |title=Mistaken identity claim over murder |date=February 15, 2003|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2003, Welshman Jeffrey Gafoor was convicted of the 1988 [[murder of Lynette White]], when crime scene evidence collected 12 years earlier was re-examined using [[Short tandem repeat|STR]] techniques, resulting in a match with his nephew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Satish Sekar |url=http://lifeloom.com/I2Sekar.htm |title=Lynette White Case: How Forensics Caught the Cellophane Man |publisher=Lifeloom.com |accessdate=2010-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125075217/http://lifeloom.com/I2Sekar.htm |archivedate=2010-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be the first known example of the DNA of an innocent yet related individual being used to identify the actual criminal, via "familial searching".
* In March 2003, Josiah Sutton was released from prison after serving four years of a twelve-year sentence for a sexual assault charge. Questionable DNA samples taken from Sutton were retested in the wake of the [[Houston Police Department]]'s crime lab scandal of mishandling DNA evidence.
* In June 2003, because of new DNA evidence, Dennis Halstead, John Kogut and John Restivo won a re-trial on their murder conviction, their convictions were struck down and they were released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/casedetail.aspx?caseid=3273 Dennis Halstead]. The National Registry of Exonerations, University of Michigan Law School, 18 April 2014. Retrieved 12 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The three men had already served eighteen years of their thirty-plus-year sentences.
* The trial of [[Robert Pickton]] (convicted in December 2003) is notable in that DNA evidence is being used primarily to identify the ''victims'', and in many cases to prove their existence.
* In 2004, DNA testing shed new light into the mysterious 1912 disappearance of [[Bobby Dunbar]], a four-year-old boy who vanished during a fishing trip. He was allegedly found alive eight months later in the custody of William Cantwell Walters, but another woman claimed that the boy was her son, Bruce Anderson, whom she had entrusted in Walters' custody. The courts disbelieved her claim and convicted Walters for the kidnapping. The boy was raised and known as Bobby Dunbar throughout the rest of his life. However, DNA tests on Dunbar's son and nephew revealed the two were not related, thus establishing that the boy found in 1912 was not Bobby Dunbar, whose real fate remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2004-05-05-1914-dna_x.htm DNA clears man of 1914 kidnapping conviction]", ''[[USA Today]]'', (May 5, 2004), by Allen G. Breed, [[Associated Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2005, Gary Leiterman was convicted of the 1969 murder of Jane Mixer, a law student at the [[University of Michigan]], after DNA found on Mixer's [[pantyhose]] was matched to Leiterman. DNA in a drop of blood on Mixer's hand was matched to John Ruelas, who was only four years old in 1969 and was never successfully connected to the case in any other way. Leiterman's defense unsuccessfully argued that the unexplained match of the blood spot to Ruelas pointed to cross-contamination and raised doubts about the reliability of the lab's identification of Leiterman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/11/22/48hours/main1066064.shtml CBS News] story on the Jane Mixer murder case; March 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Another [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/17/earlyshow/main3065082.shtml CBS News] story on the Mixer case; July 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garyisinnocent.org/ An advocacy site] challenging Leiterman's conviction in the Mixer murder.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In December 2005, Evan Simmons was proven innocent of a 1981 attack on an Atlanta woman after serving twenty-four years in prison. Mr. Clark is the 164th person in the United States and the fifth in Georgia to be freed using post-conviction DNA testing.
* In November 2008, [[Anthony Curcio]] was arrested for masterminding one of the most elaborately planned armored car heists in history.  DNA evidence linked Curcio to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doughery|first1=Phil|title=D.B. Tuber|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=8829|publisher=History Link}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In March 2009, [[Sean Hodgson]]—convicted of 1979 killing of Teresa De Simone, 22, in her car in [[Southampton]]—was released after tests proved DNA from the scene was not his. It was later matched to DNA retrieved from the exhumed body of David Lace. Lace had previously confessed to the crime but was not believed by the detectives. He served time in prison for other crimes committed at the same time as the murder and then committed suicide in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Booth|first1=Jenny|title=Police name David Lace as true killer of Teresa De Simone|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article6838034.ece|website=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2012, familial DNA profiling led to Alice Collins Plebuch's unexpected discovery that her ancestral bloodline was not purely Irish, as she had previously been led to believe, but that her heritage also contained European Jewish, Middle Eastern and Eastern European. This led her into an extensive genealogy investigation which resulted in her uncovering the genetic family of her adopted father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who Was She?

* In 2016 Anthea Ring, abandoned as baby, was able to use a DNA sample and DNA matching database to discover her deceased mother's identity and roots in County Mayo, Ireland. A recently developed forensic test was subsequently used to capture DNA from saliva left on old stamps and envelopes by her suspected father, uncovered through painstaking genealogy research. The DNA in the first three samples was too degraded to use. However, on the fourth, more than enough DNA was found. The test, which has a degree of accuracy acceptable in UK courts, proved that a man named Patrick Coyne was her biological father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who were my parents – and why was I left on a hillside to die?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43420678|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livingdna.com/blog/306/living-dna-provide-closure-lifetime-search-biological-father|title=Living DNA provide closure on lifetime search for biological father|date=March 19, 2018|website= Living DNA|access-date=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2018 William Earl Talbott II was arrested as a suspect for the 1987 [[murder of Jay Cook and Tanya Van Cuylenborg]] with the assistance of [[genealogical DNA test]]ing.  The same genetic genealogist that helped in this case also helped police with 18 other arrests in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-to-solve-cold-cases-all-it-takes-is-dna-a-genealogy-site-and-high-speed-internet-1.6657176|title=To Solve Cold Cases, All It Takes Is Crime Scene DNA, a Genealogy Site and High-speed Internet|last=Michaeli|first=Yarden|date=2018-11-16|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2019, dismembered remains found in a cave in Idaho in 1979 and 1991 were identified through genetic fingerprinting as belonging to [[Joseph Henry Loveless]]. Loveless was a habitual criminal who had disappeared after escaping from jail in 1916, where he had been charged with killing his wife Agnes with an axe. Clothes found with the remains matched the description of those Loveless was wearing when he made his escape.
