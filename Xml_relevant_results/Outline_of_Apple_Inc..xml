***[[Mac OS X v10.0|Cheetah (10.0)]] &amp;ndash; the first [[Software version|major release]] of Mac OS X, Apple's desktop and server operating system. Mac OS X v10.0 was released on March 24, 2001. It was the successor of the [[Mac OS X Public Beta]] and the predecessor of Mac OS X v10.1. Mac OS X v10.0 was a radical departure from the previous “classic” Macintosh operating system and was Apple's long-awaited answer to the call for a next generation Macintosh operating system.
***[[Mac OS X v10.1|Puma (10.1)]] &amp;ndash; the second major release of Mac OS X. Apple introduced many features that were missing from the last version, as well as improving overall system performance.
