{{campaignbox Roman conquest of Britain}}
{{RomanMilitary}}

The '''Roman conquest of Britain''' was a gradual process, beginning in AD&amp;nbsp;43 under Emperor [[Claudius]] and being largely completed by 87 when the [[Stanegate]] was established as the northen frontier. 

The [[Roman army]] was generally recruited in [[Roman Italy|Italia]], [[Hispania]], and [[Gaul]]. To cross the [[English Channel]] they used the newly-formed ''[[Classis Britannica]]'' fleet equipped with Mediterranean war galleys,{{fact|date=January 2020}} which were much thicker in wood and more stable on rough waters.

The Romans under their general [[Aulus Plautius]] first forced their way inland in several battles against [[List of ancient Celtic peoples and tribes#Great Britain (Britannia)|British tribes]], including the [[Battle of the Medway]], the Battle of the Thames, and in later years the [[Caratacus's last battle|Battle of Caer Caradoc]] against [[Caratacus]] and the [[Roman conquest of Anglesey|Battle of Mona]] in [[Anglesey]].&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples'', p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Following a general [[Boudica#Boudica's uprising|uprising]] in AD 60&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' 14.29–39, Agricola 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, ''Roman History'', 62.1–12&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[Boudicca]] sacked [[Camulodunum]],&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples'', p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Verulamium]]&lt;ref name="englishspeakingP7"&gt;Churchill, ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Londinium]],&lt;ref name="englishspeakingP7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welch, ''Britannia: The Roman Conquest &amp; Occupation of Britain'', 1963, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; the Romans suppressed the rebellion in the [[Defeat of Boudica|Battle of Watling Street]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'', 14.37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; They went on eventually to push as far north as central [[Caledonia]] in the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]].&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, ''The Roman Conquest Of Scotland: The Battle Of Mons Graupius AD 84''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Even after [[Hadrian's Wall]] was established as the border, tribes in Scotland and northern England repeatedly rebelled against Roman rule and forts continued to be maintained across northern Britain to protect against these attacks.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, ''A History of the English-Speaking Peoples'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{also|Julius Caesar's invasions of Britain}}
In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|expeditions in 55 and 54&amp;nbsp;BC]], and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman [[Iron Age]], especially in the south.

Between 55&amp;nbsp;BC and the 40s&amp;nbsp;AD, the ''status quo'' of tribute, hostages, and [[Roman client kingdoms in Britain|client states]] without direct military occupation, begun by [[Caesar's invasions of Britain]], largely remained intact. [[Augustus]] prepared invasions in 34&amp;nbsp;BC, 27&amp;nbsp;BC and 25&amp;nbsp;BC. The first and third were called off due to revolts elsewhere in the empire, the second because the Britons seemed ready to come to terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/49*.html#38 49.38], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#22 53.22], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/53*.html#25 53.25]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Augustus's ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]]'', two British kings, [[Dubnovellaunus]] and [[Tincomarus]], fled to Rome as supplicants during his reign,&lt;ref&gt;[[Augustus]], ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/6*.html#32 32]. The name of the second king is defaced, but Tincomarus is the most likely reconstruction.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Strabo]]'s ''Geography'', written during this period, says Britain paid more in customs and duties than could be raised by taxation if the island were conquered.&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geography'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4E*.html 4.5]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 40s&amp;nbsp;AD, the political situation within Britain was in ferment. The [[Catuvellauni]] had displaced the [[Trinovantes]] as the most powerful kingdom in south-eastern Britain, taking over the former Trinovantian capital of [[Camulodunum]] ([[Colchester]]). The [[Atrebates]] tribe whose capital was at Calleva Atrebatum ([[Silchester]]) had friendly trade and diplomatic links with Rome and [[Verica]] was recognised by Rome as their king, but [[Caratacus]]' [[Catuvellauni]] conquered the entire kingdom some time after 40 AD and Verica was expelled from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dio Cassius]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#19 60:19]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Creighton (2000), ''Coins and power in Late Iron Age Britain'', Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caligula]] may have planned a campaign against the Britons in AD 40, but its execution was unclear: according to [[Suetonius]]' ''[[The Twelve Caesars]]'', he drew up his troops in battle formation facing the [[English Channel]] and, once his forces had become quite confused, ordered them to gather [[seashell]]s, referring to them as "plunder from the ocean due to the [[Capitoline Hill|Capitol]] and the [[Palatine Hill|Palace]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Caligula'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html#44 44–46]; Dio Cassius, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/59*.html#25 59.25]&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, he may have actually told them to gather "huts", since the word ''musculi'' was also soldier's [[slang]] for engineers' huts and Caligula himself was very familiar with the Empire's soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/10191974/Caligula-Mad-bad-and-maybe-a-little-misunderstood.html Caligula: Mad, bad, and maybe a little misunderstood], ''Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; In any case this readied the troops and facilities that would make Claudius' invasion possible three years later. For example, Caligula built a lighthouse at {{lang|la|Bononia}} (modern [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]), the ''Tour D'Ordre'', that provided a model for the one built soon after at {{lang|la|[[Dubris]]}} (Dover).

==Claudian preparations==
In 43, possibly by reassembling Caligula's troops from 40, [[Claudius]] mounted an invasion force under overall charge of [[Aulus Plautius]], a distinguished senator.&lt;ref&gt;Dio Cassius, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/60*.html#19 60.19–22]&lt;/ref&gt; A pretext of the invasion was to reinstate [[Verica]], the exiled king of the [[Atrebates]].

It is unclear how many [[Roman legion|legions]] were sent as only the ''{{lang|la|[[Legio II Augusta]]}}'', commanded by future emperor [[Vespasian]] was directly attested to have taken part.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Tacitus |title=[[Histories (Tacitus)|Histories]] |at=[[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 3#44|3.44]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''{{lang|la|[[Legio IX Hispana|IX Hispana]]}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Tacitus |title=Annals |at=[[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#32|14.32]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''{{lang|la|[[Legio XIV Gemina|XIV Gemina]]}}'' (later styled ''{{lang|la|Martia Victrix}}'') and the ''{{lang|la|[[Legio XX Valeria Victrix|XX]]}}'' (later styled ''{{lang|la|Valeria Victrix}}'')&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Tacitus |title=Annals |at=[[s:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 14#34|14.34]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; are known to have served during the [[Boudica|Boudican Revolt]] of 60/61, and were probably there since the initial invasion, but the [[Roman army]] was flexible, with cohorts and auxiliary units being moved around whenever necessary.

Three other men of appropriate rank to command legions are known from the sources to have been involved in the invasion. [[Cassius Dio]] mentions [[Gnaeus Hosidius Geta]], who probably led the ''IX Hispana'', and Vespasian's brother [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul AD 47)|Titus Flavius Sabinus the Younger]]. He wrote that Sabinus was Vespasian's lieutenant, but as Sabinus was the older brother and preceded Vespasian into public life, he could hardly have been a [[military tribune]]. [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]] mentions [[Gnaeus Sentius Saturninus (consul 41)|Gnaeus Sentius Saturninus]], although as a former consul he may have been too senior, and perhaps accompanied Claudius later.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Abridgement of Roman History'' [http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/eutropius/trans7.html#13 7:13]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crossing and landing==
{{Main|Site of the Claudian invasion of Britain}}
[[File:British.coinage.Roman.invasion.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Campaigns under Aulus Plautius and the British tribes]]

The main invasion force under Aulus Plautius crossed in three divisions. The port of departure is usually taken to have been [[Boulogne]] ({{lang-la|Bononia}}), and the main landing at [[Richborough Castle|Rutupiae]] ([[Richborough]], on the east coast of [[Kent]]). Neither of these locations is certain. Dio does not mention the port of departure, and although Suetonius says that the secondary force under Claudius sailed from Boulogne,&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"&gt;Suetonius, ''Claudius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#17 17]&lt;/ref&gt; it does not necessarily follow that the entire invasion force did. Richborough has a large natural harbour which would have been suitable, and archaeology shows Roman military occupation at about the right time. However, Dio says the Romans sailed east to west, and a journey from Boulogne to Richborough is south to north. Some historians&lt;ref&gt;For example, John Manley, ''AD43: a Reassessment''.&lt;/ref&gt; suggest a sailing from Boulogne to the [[Solent]], landing in the vicinity of Noviomagus ([[Chichester]]) or [[Southampton]], in territory formerly ruled by Verica.

==River Battles==
British resistance was led by [[Togodumnus]] and [[Caratacus]], sons of the late king of the Catuvellauni, [[Cunobeline]]. A substantial British force met the Romans at a river crossing thought to be near [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] on the [[River Medway]]. The [[Battle of the Medway]] raged for two days. [[Gnaeus Hosidius Geta]] was almost captured, but recovered and turned the battle so decisively that he was awarded the "[[Roman triumph]]".

The British were pushed back to the [[River Thames|Thames]]. They were pursued by the Romans across the river causing some Roman losses in the marshes of [[Essex]]. Whether the Romans made use of an existing bridge for this purpose or built a temporary one is uncertain. At least one division of auxiliary Batavian troops swam across the river as a separate force.

Togodumnus died shortly after the battle on the Thames. Plautius halted and sent word for Claudius to join him for the final push. Cassius Dio presents this as Plautius needing the emperor's assistance to defeat the resurgent British, who were determined to avenge Togodumnus. However, Claudius was no military man and the [[Praetorian Guard#Under the Julio-Claudian dynasty|Praetorian cohorts]] accompanied Emperor Claudius to Britain in 43 AD. [[Arch of Claudius (British victory)|The Arch of Claudius]] in Rome says he received the surrender of eleven British kings with no losses,&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Arch of Claudius|Arch of Claudius]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Suetonius' ''The Twelve Caesars'' says that Claudius received the surrender of the Britons without battle or bloodshed.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt; It is likely that the Catuvellauni were already as good as beaten, allowing the emperor to appear as conqueror on the final march on Camulodunum. Cassius Dio relates that he brought [[war elephant]]s and heavy armaments which would have overawed any remaining native resistance. Eleven tribes of South East Britain surrendered to Claudius and the Romans prepared to move further west and north. The Romans established their new capital at Camulodunum and Claudius returned to Rome to celebrate his victory. Caratacus escaped and would continue the resistance further west.

After the invasion, Verica may have been restored as king of the Atrebates although by this time he would have been very elderly. In any case a new ruler for their region, [[Cogidubnus]], soon appeared as his heir and as king of a number of territories following the first stage of the conquest as a reward as a Roman ally.&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus: Agricola 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==AD&amp;nbsp;44–60==
[[File:Roman.Britain.campaigns.43.to.60.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Roman campaigns from AD&amp;nbsp;43 to 60.]]

[[File:Roman Empire in 54 AD.png|thumb|right|upright=1.1|The Roman Empire in AD&amp;nbsp;54.]]
[[Vespasian]] took a force westwards subduing tribes and capturing ''[[oppidum|oppida]]'' as he went, going at least as far as [[Exeter]], which became a base for Leg. II Augusta from 55 till 75.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Vespasian'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#4 4]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legio IX Hispana]] was sent north towards [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] ({{lang-la|Lindum Colonia}}) and by 47 it is likely that an area south of a line from the [[Humber]] to the [[Severn Estuary]] was under Roman control. That this line is followed by the Roman road of the [[Fosse Way]] has led many historians to debate the route's role as a convenient frontier during the early occupation. It is more likely that the border between Roman and Iron Age Britain was less direct and more mutable during this period.

Late in 47 the new governor of Britain, [[Publius Ostorius Scapula]], began a campaign against the tribes of modern-day [[Wales]], and the [[Cheshire Plain|Cheshire Gap]]. The [[Silures]] of southeast Wales caused considerable problems to Ostorius and fiercely defended the Welsh border country. Caratacus himself was defeated in the [[Battle of Caer Caradoc]] and fled to the Roman client tribe of the Brigantes who occupied the [[Pennines]]. Their queen, [[Cartimandua]] was unable or unwilling to protect him however, given her own truce with the Romans, and handed him over to the invaders. Ostorius died and was replaced by [[Aulus Didius Gallus]] who brought the Welsh borders under control but did not move further north or west, probably because Claudius was keen to avoid what he considered a difficult and drawn-out war for little material gain in the mountainous terrain of upland Britain. When [[Nero]] became emperor in 54, he seems to have decided to continue the invasion and appointed [[Quintus Veranius]] as governor, a man experienced in dealing with the troublesome hill tribes of [[Anatolia]]. Veranius and his successor [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]] mounted a successful campaign across Wales, famously destroying the [[druid]]ical centre at [[Anglesey|Mona]] or [[Anglesey]] in 60 at what historians later called the [[Menai Massacre]]. Final occupation of Wales was postponed however when the rebellion of [[Boudica]] forced the Romans to return to the south east in 60 or 61.

==AD&amp;nbsp;60–78==
Following the successful [[Battle of Watling Street|suppression]] of [[Boudica]]'s uprising in 60 or 61, a number of new Roman governors continued the conquest by edging north. 

The leader of the Brigantes was queen [[Cartimandua]],&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Histories'', 3.45, Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; whose husband [[Venutius]] might have been a [[Carvetii|Carvetian]] and may therefore have been responsible for the incorporation of Cumbria into the Brigantian federation whose territory straddled Britain along the [[Solway Firth|Solway]]-[[River Tyne|Tyne]] line. Cartimandua may have ruled the Brigantian peoples east of the Pennines (possibly with a centre at [[Stanwick Iron Age Fortifications|Stanwick]]), while Venutius was the chief of the Brigantes (or Carvetii) west of the Pennines in Cumbria (with a possible centre based at [[Clifton Dykes]].) &lt;ref&gt;Shotter (2004), pp. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Cartimandua was forced to ask for Roman aid following a rebellion by Venutius in 69. The Romans evacuated Cartimandua leaving Venutius in power, but the Roman conquest of the Brigantes began in 70. [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] took his legions from Lincoln as far as [[York]] and defeated Venutius near Stanwick around 70. This resulted in the already Romanised Brigantes and [[Parisii (Yorkshire)|Parisii]] tribes being further assimilated into the empire proper. 

Details of the early years of the Roman occupation in North Britain are unclear but began no earlier than 71, as Tacitus says that in that year [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] (governor 71-74 AD) waged a successful war against the [[Brigantes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|98|pp=362}}, ''Life of Agricola'', Ch. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Tacitus praises both Cerialis and his successor [[Sextus Julius Frontinus|Julius Frontinus]] (governor 75–78).

Much of the conquest of the north may have been achieved under the governorships of [[Vettius Bolanus]] (governor 69-71 AD), and of Cerialis.&lt;ref&gt;Shotter (2000), pp. 189-198.&lt;/ref&gt; From other sources, it seems that Bolanus had possibly dealt with Venutius and penetrated into Scotland, and evidence from the carbon-dating of the gateway timbers of the Roman fort at Carlisle ([[Luguvalium]]) suggest that they were felled in 72 AD, during the governorship of Cerialis.&lt;ref&gt;Shotter (2004), pp. 28-35.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] played his part in the west as commander of the legion XX [[Valeria Victrix]] (71-73), while Cerialis led the [[IX Hispania]] in the east. In addition, the [[Legio II Adiutrix]] sailed from Chester up river estuaries to cause surprise to the enemy.

The western thrust was started from [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]], where there is evidence of a Cerialian foundation, and followed the line of the Lune and Eden river valleys through Low Borrow Bridge and [[Brougham, Cumbria|Brougham]] ([[Brocavum]]). On the Cumbrian coast, [[Ravenglass]] and [[Blennerhasset]] were probably involved from evidence of one of the earliest Roman occupations in Cumbria. [[Beckfoot]] and [[Maryport]] may also have featured early on.&lt;ref&gt;Caruana (1997), pp. 1-168, 40-51.&lt;/ref&gt; At some point between 72-73, part of Cerialis's force moved across the Stainmore Pass from Corbridge westwards to join Agricola, as evidenced by campaign camps (which may have been previously set up by Bolanus) at [[Rey Cross]], Crackenthorpe, [[Kirkby Thore]] and Plumpton Head. Signal- or watch-towers are also in evidence across the Stainmore area - Maiden Castle, Bowes Moor and Roper Castle, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Shotter (2004), pp. 29-36.&lt;/ref&gt; The two forces then moved up from the vicinity of Penrith to Carlisle, establishing the fort there in 72/73AD.&lt;ref&gt;Shotter (2014), p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Frontinus was sent into Roman Britain in 74 to succeed Cerialis as [[Roman governors of Britain|governor]]. 

He returned to the conquest of [[Wales]] interrupted years before and with steady and successful progress finally subdued the [[Silures]] in circa 76 and other hostile tribes, establishing a new base at [[Caerleon]] for [[Legio II Augusta|Legio II ''Augusta'']] ([[Isca Augusta]]) in 75 and a network of smaller forts fifteen to twenty kilometres apart for his auxiliary units. During his tenure, he probably established the fort at [[Pumsaint]] in west [[Wales]], largely to exploit the [[gold]] deposits at [[Dolaucothi]]. He retired in 78, and later he was appointed water commissioner in [[Rome]].

[[File:Roman Empire in 96 AD.png|thumb|right|upright=1.1|The Roman Empire in AD&amp;nbsp;96.]]

The new governor was Agricola, returning to Britain, and made famous through the highly laudatory biography of him written by his son-in-law, Tacitus. Arriving in mid-summer of 78, Agricola completed the conquest of Wales in defeating the Ordovices&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus: Agricola XVIII&lt;/ref&gt; who had destroyed a cavalry [[ala (Roman military)|ala]] of Roman auxiliaries stationed in their territory. Knowing the terrain from his prior military service in Britain, he was able to move quickly to virtually exterminate them. He then invaded [[Anglesey]], forcing the inhabitants to sue for peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|98|pp=363–364}}, ''Life of Agricola'', Ch. 18&lt;/ref&gt; 

The following year he moved against the [[Brigantes]] of northern England and the [[Selgovae]] along the southern coast of Scotland, using overwhelming military power to re-establish Roman control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|98|pp=365–366}}, ''Life of Agricola'', Ch. 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricola in Caledonia===
Tacitus says that after a combination of force and diplomacy quieted discontent among the Britons who had been conquered previously, Agricola built forts in their territories in 79. In 80 he marched to the [[Firth of Tay]] (some historians hold that he stopped along the [[Firth of Forth]] in that year), not returning south until 81, at which time he consolidated his gains in the new lands that he had conquered, and in the rebellious lands that he had re-conquered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|98|pp=364–368}}, ''Life of Agricola'', Ch. 19–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Tacitus|98|pp=368–380}}, ''Life of Agricola'', Ch. 24–38.&lt;/ref&gt; In 82 he sailed to either [[Kintyre]] or the shores of [[Argyll]], or to both. In 83 and 84 he moved north along Scotland's eastern and northern coasts using both land and naval forces, campaigning successfully against the inhabitants, and winning a significant victory over the northern British peoples led by [[Calgacus]] at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]]. Archaeology has shown the Romans built military camps in the north along [[Gask Ridge]], controlling the glens that provided access to and from the [[Scottish Highlands]], and also throughout the [[Scottish Lowlands]] in northeastern Scotland.

Prior to his recall in 84, Agricola built a network of military roads and forts to secure the Roman occupation. Existing forts were strengthened and new ones planted in northeastern Scotland along the [[Highland Line]], consolidating control of the glens that provided access to and from the [[Scottish Highlands]]. The line of military communication and supply along southeastern Scotland and northeastern England (i.e., [[Dere Street]]) was well-fortified. In southern-most Caledonia, the lands of the [[Selgovae]] (approximating to modern [[Dumfriesshire]] and the [[Kirkcudbrightshire|Stewartry of Kirkcudbright]]) were heavily planted with forts, not only establishing effective control there, but also completing a military enclosure of south-central Scotland (most of the [[Southern Uplands]], [[Teviotdale]], and western [[Tweeddale]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Frere|1987|pp=88–89}}, ''Britannia''&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to Roman actions against the Selgovae, the territories of the [[Novantae]], [[Damnonii]], and [[Votadini]] were not planted with forts, and there is nothing to indicate that the Romans were at war with them.

==AD&amp;nbsp;84–117==

Agricola's successors are not named in any surviving source, but it seems they were unable or unwilling to further subdue the far north. The fortress at [[Inchtuthil]] was dismantled before its completion and the other fortifications of the [[Gask Ridge]] in [[Perthshire]], erected to consolidate the Roman presence in Scotland in the aftermath of [[Mons Graupius]], were abandoned within the space of a few years. It is equally likely that the costs of a drawn-out war outweighed any economic or political benefit and it was more profitable to leave the Caledonians alone and only under ''[[de jure]]'' submission.

With the decline of imperial ambitions in Scotland (and Ireland) by 87 AD (the withdrawal of the XX legion), consolidation based on the line of the [[Stanegate]] road (between Carlisle and Corbridge) was settled upon. Carlisle was the seat of a 'centurio regionarius' (or 'district commissioner'). When the Stanegate became the new frontier it was augmented by large forts as at [[Vindolanda]] and additional forts at half-day marching intervals were built at [[Newbrough]], [[Magnis (Carvoran)|Magnis]] (Carvoran) and [[Brampton Old Church]].  

[[File:Stanegate.jpg|thumb|left|The Stanegate line is marked in red, to the south of the later Hadrian's Wall. (n.b. Brocavum is Brougham, not Kirkby Thore as given in the map)]]

The years 87-117 were of consolidation and only a few sites north of the Stanegate line were maintained, while the signs are that an orderly withdrawal to the Solway-Tyne line was made. There does not seem to have been any rout caused as a result of battles with various tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Shotter (2004), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modifications to the Stanegate line, with the reduction in the size of the forts and the addition of fortlets and watchtowers between them, seem to have taken place from the mid-90s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Shotter (2004), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the Stanegate line, other forts existed along the Solway Coast at Beckfoot, [[Alauna (Maryport)|Maryport]], Burrow Walls (near to the present town of  Workington) and [[Moresby, Cumbria|Moresby]] (near to Whitehaven). Other forts in the region were built to consolidate Roman presence (Beckfoot, for example may date from the late 1st century). A fort at [[Troutbeck, Eden|Troutbeck]] may have been established from the period of Trajan (emperor 98-117) onwards. Other forts that may have been established during this period include Ambleside ([[Galava]]), positioned to take advantage of ship-borne supply to the forts of the [[Lake District]]. From here, a road was constructed during the Trajanic period to [[Hardknott Roman Fort]]. A road between Ambleside to Old Penrith and/or Brougham, going over [[High Street (Lake District)|High Street]], may also date from this period.

==From AD 117==
[[File:Roman.Britain.Romanisation.jpg|thumb|250px|Levels of Romanisation by area and date]]

Under [[Hadrian]], Roman occupation was withdrawn to a defendable frontier by the construction of [[Hadrian's Wall]] from around 122. In 142 an attempt was made to push the frontier north to the [[River Clyde]]-[[River Forth]] area when the [[Antonine Wall]] was constructed. This was once again abandoned after two decades and only subsequently re-occupied on an occasional basis. Meanwhile the Romans retreated to the earlier and stronger Hadrian's Wall in the [[River Tyne, England|River Tyne]]-[[Solway Firth]] frontier area. 

Roman troops, however, penetrated far into the north of modern Scotland several more times. Indeed, there is a greater density of Roman marching camps in Scotland than anywhere else in Europe as a result of at least four major attempts to subdue the area.

The most notable was in 209 when the emperor [[Septimius Severus]], claiming to be provoked by the belligerence of the [[Maeatae]] tribe, campaigned against the [[Caledonian Confederacy]], a coalition of [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] [[Pictish]]&lt;ref&gt;^ Encyclopaedia Romana. University of Chicago. accessed March 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; tribes of the north of Britain.  He used the three legions of the British garrison (augmented by the recently formed 2nd Parthica legion), 9000 imperial guards with cavalry support, and numerous auxiliaries supplied from the sea by the British fleet, the Rhine fleet and two fleets transferred from the Danube for the purpose. According to [[Dio Cassius]], he inflicted genocidal depredations on the natives and incurred the loss of 50,000 of his own men to the attrition of [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] tactics before having to withdraw to Hadrian's Wall. He repaired and reinforced the wall with a degree of thoroughness that led most subsequent Roman authors to attribute the construction of the wall to him. It was during the negotiations to purchase the truce necessary to secure the Roman retreat to the wall that the first recorded utterance, attributable with any reasonable degree of confidence, to a native of Scotland was made (as recorded by Dio Cassius). When Septimius Severus's wife, Julia Domna, criticised the sexual morals of the Caledonian women, the wife of a Caledonian chief, Argentocoxos, replied: "We consort openly with the best of men while you allow yourselves to be debauched in private by the worst".&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' 77.16&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor Septimius Severus died at [[York]] while planning to renew hostilities, and these plans were abandoned by his son [[Caracalla]].

Later excursions into Scotland by the Romans were generally limited to the scouting expeditions of ''exploratores'' in the buffer zone that developed between the walls, trading contacts, bribes to purchase truces from the natives, and eventually the spread of Christianity. The degree to which the Romans interacted with the [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]]-speaking island of [[Hibernia]] (modern [[Ireland]]) is still unresolved amongst archaeologists in Ireland.
