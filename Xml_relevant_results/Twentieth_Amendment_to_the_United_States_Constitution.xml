The '''Twentieth Amendment''' ('''Amendment XX''') to the [[United States Constitution]] moved the beginning and ending of the terms of the [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] from March 4 to January 20, and of members of Congress from March 4 to January 3. It also has provisions that determine what is to be done when there is no [[President-elect of the United States|president-elect]]. The Twentieth Amendment was adopted on January 23, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html Constitution of the United States: Amendments 11-27] Archives.gov. Retrieved October 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment was designed largely to limit the "[[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]" period, the period served by Congress and the president after an election but before the end of the terms of those who were not re-elected. Because under the amendment Congressional terms begin before presidential terms, it is now the incoming Congress, rather than the outgoing one, that would hold a [[contingent election]] in the event that no candidate wins a majority of the [[United States Electoral College|electoral vote]] in a presidential election. The amendment also establishes procedures in the case that a president-elect dies, is not chosen, or otherwise fails to qualify prior to the start of a new presidential term.

==Historical background==
[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Sessions of Congress|Article I, Section 4, Clause 2]] of the Constitution states that Congress must meet at least once per year, on the first Monday in December, though Congress could by law set another date and the president could summon special sessions.

The original text of the Constitution set a duration for the terms of federal elected officials, but not the specific dates on which those terms would begin or end. In September 1788, after the necessary nine states had ratified the Constitution, the [[Congress of the Confederation]] set March 4, 1789, as the date "for commencing proceedings" of the newly reorganized government. Despite the fact that the new Congress and presidential administration did not begin operation until April, March 4 was deemed to be the beginning of the newly elected officials' terms of office, and thus of the terms of their successors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ackerman|first=Bruce|title=The Failure of the Founding Fathers: Jefferson, Marshall, and the Rise of Presidential Democracy|url=https://archive.org/details/failureoffoundi00acke|url-access=registration|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|date=2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/failureoffoundi00acke/page/117 117–8]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution did not specify a date for federal elections, but by the time of the second presidential election in 1792, Congress had passed a law requiring presidential electors to be chosen during November or early December.&lt;ref&gt;The bill originally specified a 30-day period for the states to choose their electors. Annals of Congress, House of Representatives, 2nd Congress, 1st Session, [http://memory.loc.gov/ll/llac/003/0100/01370277.tif p. 278]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1845, this was narrowed to a single day, in early November.&lt;ref&gt;Statutes at Large, 28th Congress, 2nd Session, [http://memory.loc.gov/ll/llsl/005/0700/07590721.tif p. 721]&lt;/ref&gt; Congressional elections were generally held on the same day.

The result of these scheduling decisions was that there was a long, four-month [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] period between the election  and inauguration of the president. For Congress, the situation was perhaps even more awkward. Because Article I, Section 4, Clause 2 mandated a Congressional meeting every December, after the election but before Congressional terms of office had expired, a lame duck session was required by the Constitution in even-numbered years; the next session wasn't required until the ''next'' December, meaning that new members of Congress might not begin their work until more than a year after they had been elected. Special sessions sometimes met earlier in the year, but this never became a regular practice, despite the Constitution allowing for it. In practice, Congress usually met in a long session beginning in Decembers of odd-numbered years, and in a short lame duck session in December of even-numbered years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ackerman|first=Bruce|title=The Failure of the Founding Fathers: Jefferson, Marshall, and the Rise of Presidential Democracy|url=https://archive.org/details/failureoffoundi00acke|url-access=registration|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|date=2005|pages=[https://archive.org/details/failureoffoundi00acke/page/119 119]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The long lame duck period might have been a practical necessity at the end of the 18th century, when any newly elected official might require several months to put his affairs in order and then undertake an arduous journey from his home to the national capital, but it eventually had the effect of impeding the functioning of government in the modern age. From the early 19th century onward, it also meant that a lame duck Congress and presidential administration would fail to adequately respond to a significant national crisis in a timely manner. Each institution could do this on the theory that at best, a lame duck Congress or administration had neither the time nor the mandate to tackle problems, whereas the incoming administration or Congress would have both the time, and a fresh electoral mandate, to examine and address the problems that the nation faced. These problems very likely would have been at the center of the debate of the just completed election cycle.

This dilemma was seen most notably in 1861 and 1933, after the elections of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], respectively, plus the newly elected Senators and Representatives. Under the Constitution at the time, these presidents had to wait four months before they and the incoming Congresses could deal with the [[Confederate States of America|secession of Southern states]] and the [[Great Depression]] respectively.

In 1916, during [[World War I]], President [[Woodrow Wilson]] devised an unorthodox plan to avoid a lame duck presidency and allow his Republican opponent [[Charles Evans Hughes]] to assume presidential powers immediately if Hughes had won the election. In that case, Wilson planned to appoint Hughes as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], at the time first in line to act as President in the event of a simultaneous vacancy in the offices of president and vice president. President Wilson and Vice President [[Thomas R. Marshall]] would have then both resigned. The plan was never implemented because Wilson was narrowly [[1916 United States presidential election|re-elected]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Michael W.|title=If Woodrow Wilson had lost the 1916 election|url=http://blogs.usyd.edu.au/theoryandpractice/2013/10/if_woodrow_wilson_had_lost_the.html|work=Political theory and practice: Thinking and doing|publisher=The University of Sydney, Australia|date=October 22, 2013|accessdate=June 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of the amendment==
Section 1 of the Twentieth Amendment prescribes January 20, at noon, as the start-finish date for the four-year term of both the President and Vice President.  Previously March 4, the new date shortened the period between [[United States presidential election|election day]] in November and Inauguration Day by about six weeks, accelerating the pace of the [[United States presidential transition|transfer of presidential power]] from the out-going president to his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halchin|first=L. Elaine|date=May 17, 2017|title=Presidential Transitions: Issues Involving Outgoing and Incoming Administrations|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL34722.pdf|publisher=Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By changing the date on which presidential terms end and begin, Section 1 superseded the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment's]] reference to March 4 as the date by which the House of Representatives must—under circumstances where no candidate won an [[absolute majority]] of votes for president in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]—conduct a [[Contingent election|contingent presidential election]].&lt;ref name=LPW20004THN&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitaker|first1=L. Paige|last2=Neale|first2=Thomas H.|title=The Electoral College: An Overview and Analysis of Reform Proposals|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metacrs5853/m1/1/high_res_d/RL30804_2004Nov05.pdf|date=November 5, 2004|orig-year=January 16, 2001|publisher=Congressional Research Service, The Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=July 23, 2018|via=[[University of North Texas Libraries|UNT Libraries]] Government Documents Department; UNT Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 1 also specifies January 3, at noon, as the start-finish date for the terms of members of the Senate and the House of Representatives; the previous date had also been March 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Significance of March 4|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/The_Significance_of_March_4.htm|publisher=Secretary of the U.S. Senate|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2 moves the yearly start date of congressional sessions from the first Monday in December, as mandated by Article I, Section 4, Clause 2, to noon on January 3 of the same year. This change eliminated the extended lame duck congressional sessions.&lt;ref name=HHistory1201937&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Inauguration after the Lame Duck Amendment: January 20, 1937|url=http://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail/35948?ret=True|publisher=Office of the Historian, U.S. House of Representatives|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this change, if the Electoral College vote has not resulted in the election of either a president or vice president, the incoming Congress, as opposed to the outgoing one, would have to do so, following the process articulated in the Twelfth Amendment.&lt;ref name=LPW20004THN/&gt;

Section 3 further refines the earlier mentioned Twelfth Amendment provision by declaring that if the president-elect dies before [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]], the vice president-elect will be sworn in as president on that day and serve for the full four-year term to which that person was elected; it further states that if on Inauguration Day a president-elect has not yet been chosen, or if the president-elect fails to qualify, the vice president-elect would become [[Acting President of the United States|Acting President]] on Inauguration Day until a president-elect is chosen or the president-elect qualifies; previously, the Constitution did not stipulate what was to be done if the Electoral College attempted to elect a constitutionally unqualified person as President. Section 3 also authorizes Congress to determine who should be acting president if a new president and vice president have not been chosen by Inauguration Day. Acting on this authority, Congress added "failure to qualify" as a possible condition for presidential succession in the [[Presidential Succession Act of 1947]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Twentieth Amendment|last1=Larson|first1=Edward J.|last2=Shesol|first2=Jeff|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xx|work=The Interactive Constitution|publisher=The National Constitution Center|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=June 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CoG2P&gt;{{cite web|title=The Continuity of the Presidency: The Second Report of the Continuity of Government Commission|series=Preserving Our Institutions|url=http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/reports/2009/06_continuity_of_government/06_continuity_of_government.pdf|page=31|publisher=Continuity of Government Commission|location=Washington, D.C.|date=June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060729/http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2009/7/06%20continuity%20of%20government/06_continuity_of_government.pdf|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=dead|via=WebCite|accessdate=May 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously silent on this point, the lack of guidance nearly caused a constitutional crisis on a couple of occasions: when the House of Representatives seemed unable to break the deadlocked [[1800 United States presidential election|election of 1800]] and when Congress seemed unable to resolve the disputed [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 election]].&lt;ref name=NCC5little&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bomboy|first=Scott|title=Five little-known men who almost became president|date=August 11, 2017|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/five-little-known-men-who-almost-became-president/|work=Constitution Daily|publisher=National Constitution Center|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=July 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ackerman|first=Bruce|title=The Failure of the Founding Fathers: Jefferson, Marshall, and the Rise of Presidential Democracy|url=https://archive.org/details/failureoffoundi00acke|url-access=registration|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|date=2005|pages=77ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 1933, twenty-three days after the amendment was adopted, President-elect Roosevelt was the target of an [[assassination]] attempt by [[Giuseppe Zangara]]. Roosevelt was not injured, but had the attempt been successful, Vice President-elect [[John Nance Garner]] would have become president on March 4, 1933 pursuant to Section 3.&lt;ref name=NCC5little/&gt;

Section 4 permits Congress to pass a law that clarifies what should occur if either the House of Representatives must elect the president and one of the candidates from whom it may choose dies, or the Senate must elect the vice president and one of the candidates from whom it may choose dies. Congress has never enacted such a statute.&lt;ref name=CoG2P/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|ssrn=2635633|title=Of Death and Deadlocks: Section 4 of the Twentieth Amendment|last=Kalt|first=Brian C.|date=October 26, 2017|journal=[[Michigan State University College of Law]]|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 5 delayed Sections 1 and 2 [[Coming into force|taking effect]] until the first October 15 following the amendment's ratification. As it was adopted on January 23, 1933, Section 1 shortened the terms of representatives elected to the [[73rd United States Congress|73rd Congress]] (1933–35), as well as those of senators elected for terms ending in 1935, 1937, and 1939, by {{age in days|1935|1|3|1935|3|4}} days.&lt;ref name=GPOCONAN20171021&gt;{{cite web|title=Commencement of the Terms of Office: Twentieth Amendment|work=Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation|url=https://www.congress.gov/content/conan/pdf/GPO-CONAN-2017-10-21.pdf|publisher=United States Government Printing Office, Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=2297–98|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 5 also resulted in the 73rd Congress not being required to meet until January 3, 1934. The first Congress to open its first session on the new date was the [[74th United States Congress|74th Congress]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 20th Amendment: January 03, 1935|url=http://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail/35272?ret=True|publisher=Office of the Historian, U.S. House of Representatives|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on the date appointed by the Twentieth Amendment were the [[Second inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt|second terms]] of President Roosevelt and Vice President Garner, on January 20, 1937.&lt;ref name=HHistory1201937/&gt; Section 1 had shortened the first term of both (1933–37) by {{age in days|1937|1|20|1937|3|4}} days.&lt;ref name=GPOCONAN20171021/&gt; Garner thus served as vice-president for two full terms, but he did not serve a full eight years (March 4, 1933–January 20, 1941).
