'''Mesoamerican pyramids''' or [[pyramid]]-shaped structures form a prominent part of ancient [[Mesoamerican architecture]]. Although similar to each other in some ways these New World structures with their flat tops (many with temples on the top) and their stairs bear only a very weak [[architecture | architectural]] resemblance to [[Egyptian pyramids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feder |first1=Kenneth L. |title=Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum |date=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9780313379192 |page=34 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RlRz2symkAsC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=Mesoamerican+pyramids+Egyptian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjakrno7YjhAhVNRBUIHZOTCY0Q6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Mesoamerican%20pyramids%20Egyptian&amp;f=false |accessdate=17 March 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Takacs |first1=Sarolta Anna |last2=Cline |first2=Eric H. |title=The Ancient World |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317458395 |page=16 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SPcvCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=Mesoamerican+pyramids+Egyptian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjakrno7YjhAhVNRBUIHZOTCY0Q6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Mesoamerican%20pyramids%20Egyptian&amp;f=false |accessdate=17 March 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Mesoamerica]]n region's largest [[pyramid]] by volume &amp;ndash; the largest pyramid in the world by volume &amp;ndash; is the [[Great Pyramid of Cholula]], in the east-central [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Mexican state|state]]  of [[Puebla]].

==Aztecs==
[[File:StaCeciliaAcatitlan.jpg|right|thumb|[[Santa Cecilia Acatitlan]] pyramid]]
The [[Aztec]]s, a people with a rich mythology and cultural heritage, dominated central Mexico in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their capital was [[Tenochtitlan]] on the shore of [[Lake Texcoco]] &amp;ndash; the site of modern-day [[Mexico City]]. They were related to the preceding cultures in the basin of Mexico such as the culture of [[Teotihuacan]] whose building style they adopted and adapted.

==Maya pyramids==
[[Image:15-07-14-Edzna-Campeche-Mexico-RalfR-WMA 0700-edit.jpg|thumb|[[Edzna]]]]
The [[Maya civilization|Maya]] are a people of southern [[Mexico]] and northern [[Central America]] ([[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], western [[Honduras]], and [[El Salvador]]) with some 3,000 years of history. [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence shows the Maya started to build ceremonial architecture approximately 3,000 years ago. The earliest monuments consisted of simple [[Tumulus|burial mounds]], the precursors to the spectacular stepped pyramids from the [[Terminal Pre-classic]] period and beyond. 

These pyramids relied on intricate carved stone in order to create a stair-stepped design. Many of these structures featured a top platform upon which a smaller dedicatory building was constructed, associated with a particular [[Maya mythology|Maya deity]]. Maya pyramid-like structures were also erected to serve as a place of interment for powerful rulers. Maya pyramidal structures occur in a great variety of forms and functions, bounded by regional and periodical differences.

==Purépechans==
The [[Tarascan state]] was a precolumbian culture located in the modern day Mexican state of [[Michoacán]]. The region is currently inhabited by the modern descendants of the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]]. Purépechan architecture is noted for "T"-shaped [[step pyramid]]s known as ''[[yácata]]s''.

==Teotihuacan==
[[Image:Piramide del Sol 072006.JPG|right|thumb|[[Pyramid of the Sun]]]]
The [[Teotihuacan]] civilization, which flourished from around 300 BCE to 500 CE, at its greatest extent included most of Mesoamerica. Teotihuacano culture collapsed around 550 and was followed by several large city-states such as Xochicalco (whose inhabitants were probably of [[Matlatzinca people|Matlatzinca]] ethnicity), Cholula (whose inhabitants were probably [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]]), and later the [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|ceremonial site of Tula]] (which has traditionally been claimed to have been built by [[Toltecs]] but which now is thought to have been founded by the [[Huastec civilization|Huastec]] culture).

== Toltec ==
[[Image:Tajin1913.jpg|right|thumb|El Tajín]]
The site called [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]], the [[Toltec]] capitol, in the state of Mexico is one of the best preserved five-tier pyramids in Mesoamerican  civilization. The ground plan of the site has two pyramids, Pyramid B and Pyramid C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mexico: From the Olmecs to the Aztecs|last = Coe|first = Michael, D|publisher = Thames and Hudson|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-500-29076-7|location = New York, New York|pages = 170–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toltec empire lasted from around 700 to 1100.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search-credoreference-com.proxy-iup.klnpa.org/content/entry/heliconhe/toltec/0|title=Toltec ‘builder’|last=|first=|date=2018|website=Credo Reference|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the origin of the Toltec Empire is a mystery, they are said to have migrated Mexico's northern plateau until they set up their empire’s capital in central Mexico, called Tula, which is 70 km/40 mi northwest of modern day Mexico City. When the city of Tula was in its prime it had around 40,000 people living in it and the city flourished from 900 to 1100.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search-credoreference-com.proxy-iup.klnpa.org/content/entry/heliconhe/tula/1|title=Tula or Tollan|last=|first=|date=|website=Credo Reference|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The city of Tula had a main plaza surrounded by 2 pyramids and a ritual ball court.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The most popular pyramid on this site (pyramid b) is the pyramid of Quetzalcoatl which is a five-tiered pyramid with four giant carved pillars on top. The pyramid of Quetzalcoatl was named after a story of a legendary priest, also named Quetzalcoatl who was exiled from Tula around the year 1000. He is said to have ended warfare between Mayan city states and after that the Toltecs started worshiping Quetzalcoatl.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Classic Veracruz==
The best known [[Classic Veracruz culture|Classic Veracruz]] pyramid, the Pyramid of Niches in [[El Tajín]], is smaller than those of their neighbours and successors but more intricate.

==Zapotecs==
The [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]]s were one of the earliest Mesoamerican cultures and held sway over the [[Valley of Oaxaca]] region from the early first millennium BCE to about the 14th century.

==Others==
The following sites are from northern Mesoamerica, built by cultures whose ethnic affiliations are unknown:

===Altavista===
[[File:Votive Pyramid La Quemada.JPG|thumb|Votive Pyramid at La Quemada]]
This astronomical and also ceremonial center was the product of the [[Chalchihuite]] culture. Its occupation and development had a period of approximately 800 years (ca. 200&amp;mdash;1000). This zone is considered an important archaeological center because of the astonishing, accurate functions of the edifications. The ones that stand out the most are: The Moon Plaza, The Votive Pyramid, the Ladder of Gamio and The labyrinth. In The Labyrinth you can appreciate with precision and accuracy, the respective equinoxes and the seasons.

====La Quemada====
A great quantity of buildings were constructed on artificial terraces upon the slopes of a hill. The materials used here include stone slab and clay. The most important structures are: The Hall of Columns, The Ball Court, The Votive Pyramid, and The Palace and the Barracks. On the most elevated part of the hill is The Fortress. This is composed of a small pyramid and a platform, encircled by a wall that is more than 800m long and up to six feet high. La Quemada was occupied from 800 to 1200. Their founders and occupants have not been identified with certainty but probably belonged to either the [[Chalchihuites]] culture or that of the neighbouring Malpaso culture.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly 2001, pp30-2.&lt;/ref&gt;
