The '''Spanish Maquis''' were [[Spain|Spanish]] [[guerrilla]]s exiled in [[France]] after the [[Spanish Civil War]] who continued to fight against [[Francoist Spain]] until the early 1960s, carrying out sabotage, robberies (to help fund guerrilla activity), occupations of the [[List of diplomatic missions of Spain|Spanish embassy]] in France and assassinations of [[Francoist Spain#Francoism|Francoists]], as well as contributing to the fight against [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] in [[France]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Marco, Jorge: ''Guerrilleros and Neighbours in Arms: Identities and Cultures of the Anti-fascist Resistance in Spain''. Brighton, Sussex Academic Press, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Referring to the contribution of the Spanish Maquis to the [[Maquis (World War II)|French resistance movement]], [[Martha Gellhorn]] wrote in ''The Undefeated'' (1945):

{{quote|During the German occupation of France, the Spanish Maquis engineered more than four hundred railway sabotages, destroyed fifty-eight locomotives, dynamited thirty-five railway bridges, cut one hundred and fifty telephone lines, attacked twenty factories, destroying some factories totally, and sabotaged fifteen coal mines. They took several thousand German prisoners and - most miraculous considering their arms - they captured three tanks.

In the south-west part of France where no Allied armies have ever fought, they liberated more than seventeen towns.}}

Also during World War II, Spaniards assassinated the German generals [[von Schaumberg]] &lt;!-- full name would be good--&gt; (commandant of the region around Paris) and von Ritter (a recruiter of forced labor). In October 1944 a group of 6,000 maquis including [[Antonio Téllez Solà]] invaded Spain via the [[Aran Valley]] but were driven back after ten days. Few details of the maquis' actions in Spain have been made public because of the secrecy of the Franco government, but guerrillas, including [[Francesc Sabaté Llopart]], [[Jose Castro Veiga]], and [[Ramon Vila Capdevila]] were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Guardia Civil ([[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]]) officers, and uncountable acts of industrial [[sabotage]]. Between 1943 and 1952, 2,166 maquis were reported arrested by the Civil Guard, nearly wiping out the movement.

==Etymology==
[[File:Maqui Mural.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A mural in [[Sallent de Llobregat|Sallent]], Barcelona, Spain, commemorating the actions of the maquis]]

The term ''maquis'' comes from the [[French language|French]] term ''maquis'', which in turn comes from the [[Corsican language|Corsican]] term ''macchia'', the [[maquis shrubland]], a type of [[biome]] found in the Mediterranean basin, mostly associated with [[Corsica]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

In France, the term was first used to refer to a group of guerrillas of the French resistance against the German occupation of France during World War II. The resistance fighters in these encampments were referred to as ''maquisards''.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

==History==
The anti-Franco guerrilla resistance in Spain began before the 1939 end of the Spanish Civil War. The outbreak of World War II so soon after the civil war surprised a large part of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican]] exiles in France; many of them joined the French Resistance. By 1944, with the German forces in retreat, many of the guerrillas refocused their fight towards Spain. Despite the failure of the invasion of the Val d'Arán that year, some columns continued to progress into the Spanish interior and to connect with the groups that had remained in the mountains since 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Aróstegui |first1= Julio |last2= Marco |first2= Jorge |date= 2008 |title=El último frente. La resistencia armada antifranquista en España, 1939-1952 |url= |location=[[Madrid]] |publisher=La Catarata |page= |isbn=9788483193815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apogee of guerrilla action was between 1945 and 1947. After this, the repression from the Franco government intensified, and little by little the groups were destroyed. Many of their members died or were incarcerated. Others escaped to France or [[Morocco]]. In 1952, the last important contingents evacuated from Spain. After that, those who resisted in the mountainous regions refusing to choose either exile or surrender, fought only for their own survival.{{cn|date=April 2019}}

===Beginnings===
The origins of the maquis in Spain lie with those who fled the advancing forces of Franco's Nationalists. The insecurity engendered by the repressive tactics of the Nationalist insurgency turned their political opponents—even many who were not politically active but simply known to sympathize with the republic—into fugitives. At first many hid in relatives' homes, but some sought refuge in the mountains. Their numbers were enhanced by deserters and by escapees from prisons and concentration camps. These constituted the nucleus of those who decided to keep fighting from the mountains.

The political character of the guerrillas was as varied as that of the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]], containing [[communist]]s, [[socialist]]s, and [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchists]]. Despite the diverse ideologies, due to the organizational persistence of the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] until 1948, the Communists dominated the other currents.

===XIV Cuerpo de Ejército===
During the war, the idea of the possibility of a guerrilla war at the rearguard of Franco's Nationalists was proposed. The idea came to fruition at the initiative of [[Juan Negrín]], at the time head of the Republican government and of the Ministry of Defense. He created the XIV Cuerpo de Ejército Guerrillero (''Guerrilla Army Corps'') in October 1937. This name was used for the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque]] section of the [[Spanish Republican Army]] until the collapse of the [[front (military)|front]] in the north.

The short-term objectives of this Corps were the interruption of the communications and supply lines to the Nationalist troops, and the carrying out of special operations. In the long term, they were to  continue the war against Franco in the case of defeat on the conventional fronts.

At the end of the war, such activities had been set in motion on the fronts of [[Teruel]], [[Andalusia]], [[Extremadura]], and [[Toledo (province)|Toledo]]. The action with the greatest significance was the liberation, on May 23, 1938, of 300 [[Asturias|Asturian]] political prisoners in [[Granada]]. Throughout 1938 and 1939 the Corps brought together many of the exiles of Andalucía and Extremadura; however, the Republican defeat brought the dissolution of the Corps.

===Retreat: the French camps===
Hundreds of thousands of Republican soldiers and civilians crossed the French border ahead of the advancing Nationalist troops in [[Catalonia]]. Once on the other side, they were put in [[concentration camp]]s by the authorities. There were 22 camps in total: [[Barcarès]], [[Agde]], [[Saint-Cyprien, Pyrénées-Orientales|Saint-Cyprien]], [[Argelès-sur-Mer]], [[Berck-Plage]], [[Montpellier Chapallete]], [[Fort Mahon Plage]], [[Tour de Carol]], [[Septfonds]], [[Baste-les-Foages]], [[Bram, Aude|Bram]], [[Haros]], [[Gurs]], [[Vernet d'Ariège]], [[Rivesaltes]], [[Fort Colliure]], and [[Rieucros]] in [[Metropolitan France]] and, in [[French colonial empires#Second French colonial empire|French North Africa]], [[Camp Morand]], [[Meridja]], [[Djelfa]], [[Hadjerat ed Dall|Hadjerat-OM'Guil]], and [[Ain-el-Curak]]. In these camps, exiles began to reorganize themselves into guerrilla groups.

In the camp of Argelès-sur-Mer a series of meetings were held. Members of the PCE and the Juventudes Socialistas Unificadas (''Unified Socialist Youth'') participated. In October 1940, the decision was made to organize [[anti-fascist]] actions in France, together with the French resistance, against the [[Vichy France|Vichy government]]. This was the beginning of the Spanish involvement on a grand scale in the fight against the [[German occupation of France during World War II|occupation of France]].

===Resistance===
On October 11, 1940 the Vichy regime started the Companies of Foreign Workers (''Compagnies de Travailleurs Etrangers'', CTE), which permitted prisoners to leave the [[concentration camp]]s, if they would go to work in factories. This increased the possibilities of escape. Shortly after the Vichy regime established the Obligatory Work Service (''[[Service du travail obligatoire]]'', STO) for French citizens, with similar objectives: to provide manual labor to armament factories and the construction of the [[Atlantic Wall]].

Those French who were released through the STO began to escape to the mountains, where they came together with Spanish who escaped from the CTE. The French escapees were mainly civilians, rather than a remnant of the defeated French army. From this time, the French term ''"maquis"'' began to be used to refer to the camps, and ''"maquisards"'' for those that occupied them.

===Formation of the AGE===
Some of the Spanish refugees joined French resistance groups, while others formed autonomous groups. In April 1942 a meeting of several Spanish combat groups decided to take the name of the ''XIV Cuerpo del Ejército de Guerrilleros Españoles'', considering themselves the Corps' successors.

In May 1944 the XIV Corps re-formed as the ''Agrupación de Guerrilleros Españoles'' (AGE, roughly ''Spanish Guerrilla Group''),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=420}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they consisted for the most part of Spanish combatants on French soil. This conveyed the group's distancing from the [[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]] (FTP), the armed branch of the [[French Communist Party]], with whom they had previously worked closely. By this time, the Spanish resistors had participated in numerous armed actions against the German army, even liberating various populations in the south of France.

The numbers of Spanish combatants in the ranks of the Resistance vary quite a bit amongst sources, but in general they accept a number around 10,000.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Secundino Serrano: ''Maquis. Historia de la guerrilla antifranquista''. Editorial Temas de Hoy, Madrid, 2001. {{ISBN|84-8460-103-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the German army was driven from France, Spanish maquis returned their focus to Spain.

===Invasion of Val d'Aran===
[[File:Pirineo Selva de Oza 1.jpg|right|thumb|One of the valleys used as an entry into Spain during Operation: Reconquest of Spain.]]
The most notable operation of the Spanish maquis was the invasion of Spain by between 4,000&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Carr: ''España 1808-1975''. Ariel Historia, Barcelona, 2003. {{ISBN|84-344-6615-5}}, ''"El PCE organizó entonces a 4.000 voluntarios para invadir España a través de los Pirineos,"'', that is, "The PCE then organized about 4,000 volunteers to invade Spain by way of the [[Pyrenees]]."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso Domingo: ''El canto del búho. La vida en el monte de los guerrilleros antifranquistas''. OberonMemoria, Grupo ANAYA, Madrid 2002. {{ISBN|84-96052-03-6}}. ''"En total, de los 13.000 españoles que estaban en el maquis francés, unos 4000 se alistaron,"'', that is "In total, of the 13,000 Spanish that were with the French maquis, some 4000 were listed.''&lt;/ref&gt; and 7,000&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; guerrillas through [[Val d'Aran]] and other parts of the [[Pyrenees]], well equipped and with heavy weapons, on October 19, 1944, after the [[German Army (1935–1945)|German Army]] had been driven from the south of France. The invasion was named "Operation Reconquest of Spain".

Operation Reconquest of Spain was planned by the AGE [[staff (military)|staff]]. To carry out the invasion they created the 204th Division, made up of 12 brigades. The division was commanded by [[Vicente López Tovar]].&lt;ref name="Beevor 2006 p=421"&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of the offensive was to retake the sector of Spanish territory comprising the land between the [[Cinca (Spain)|Cinca]] and [[Segre (river)|Segre]] Rivers and the French border. Later, the zone was declared conquered by the [[Spanish Republican government in exile]], with the intention of provoking a general uprising against Franco throughout Spain. It was hoped that it would force the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to "liberate" Spain the same way it was "liberating" the rest of Europe.

The main attack in the valley was accompanied by operations in other valleys of the Pyrenees during the previous weeks, with the objective of distracting Franco's forces.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2006 p=421"/&gt; These other attacks were intended also to evaluate the situation in the interior of Spain, and make contact with other groups of exiles. The most important points of penetration in the long chain of mountains were [[Roncesvalles]], [[Roncal – Erronkari|Roncal]], [[Hecho]], [[Canfranc]], [[Val d'Aran]], [[Andorra]], and [[Cerdanya]], though there were also operations at smaller points.

The offensives were repelled by a great force that was moved into the area by Franco, made up of the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Civil Guard]], [[Armed Police Corps]], battalions of the [[Spanish Army]], and 40,000 [[Moroccans|Moroccan]] ([[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]]) troops.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2006 p=422"&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guerrilla army conquered various towns and villages, raising the [[Flag of the Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican flag]], carrying out anti-Franco meetings in the plazas, as well as controlling part of the French border for several days, through which they were able to bring in trucks, material and reinforcements from France. However, the invasion failed to take [[Vielha e Mijaran]], its principal objective. Finally, overwhelmed by the Nationalists' numeric and material advantage, the guerrillas pulled back. The retreat ended October 28,&lt;ref name="Beevor 2006 p=422"/&gt; when the last guerrillas re-crossed the border back into France, without the hoped-for uprising.

The failure of the invasion was used by the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] members of the PCE's Central Committee, recently arrived from the Soviet Union to France, to purge the heads of the party who had remained in France fighting the Germans. Most were either kidnapped and assassinated or summarily judged and shot.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Mikel Rodríguez Álvarez. ''Maquis. La guerrilla vasca (1938-1962)''. Editorial Txalaparta.{{ISBN|84-8136-195-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Agrupaciones Guerrilleras"===
In spite of the setback of Arán in 1944, the expectations of the exiled Spanish Communist Party ([[Communist Party of Spain (main)|PCE]]) remained high, given that all seemed still possible in an international context of general collapse of fascism. All throughout Spain, the level of guerrilla activity went up, precipitated by the incorporation of new contingents forced to cross the border from France&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; and the reorganization of the groups with structures of a more military character.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The exiled PCE promoted the creation of the ''Agrupaciones Guerrilleras'' (Guerrilla Groups) in several geographic zones, coordinating the actions between them. It was modeled after the ''Federación de Guerrillas de [[Province of León|León]]-[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]'', the first guerrilla organization of the post-war era. The most active group from the AG was the ''Agrupación Guerrillera de [[Levante, Spain|Levante]] y [[Aragón]] (AGLA)'', which was active in the area between the southern part of [[Teruel]], the interior of [[Province of Castellón|Castellón]] and the north of [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]]. Also noteworthy was the ''Agrupación de Guerilleros "Stalingrado"'' (Stalingrad Group) headed up by ''Manolo el Rubio'' (Pablo Pérez Hidalgo), which operated  in the Sierra de Bermeja near Cádiz, and at its peak boasted a force of 50 resistance fighters.&lt;ref&gt;Jesús Torbado &amp; Manuel Leguineche Bollar. ''Los Topos''. Editorial Argos Vergara, 1977. {{ISBN|84-7017-478-9}}. Published in English as ''The Moles'', tr. Nancy Festinger, Martin Secker &amp; Warburg, 1981. {{ISBN|0-436-52600-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these groups were extremely sectarian in their aims and organization, following invariably the strategies dictated by the Central Committee (controlled by Moscow).  The will to keep fighting was maintained by strict discipline imposed by the PCE kommisars. People in these groups who wanted to leave and rejoin a normal civilian life were most of the time treated as deserters and shot,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; even at the rearguard guerrilla camps in France.

In 1948 the PCE changed its strategy, and at the behest of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]],&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Carr: ''España 1808-1975''. Ariel Historia, Barcelona, 2003. {{ISBN|84-344-6615-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; renounced the guerrilla fight, preferring to try to change the state-sanctioned [[Spanish Syndical Organization]] from within. This began the decline of the ''agrupaciones'', already quite beaten by government repression. The ''Agrupaciones Guerrilleras'' renamed themselves ''Comités de Resistencia''. The new orientation, however, was not effective, and ultimately a general evacuation was decreed in 1952.

===End of the maquis===
There were several factors in the decline and disappearance of the Spanish maquis. On one side, the commencement of the [[Cold War]] made it evident that the Allies would not intervene in the maquis's fight against the Spanish State. This led the PCE to change strategy, ending its support for the guerrilla groups in the 1950s.

The government had a policy of total silence on the actions of the maquis. For this reason, outside of the areas of maquis activity, the population had practically no knowledge of the maquis. On the rare occasion that an item appeared in the press, the maquis were always referred to as "''bandoleros''" (bandits), in order to strip the actions of all political context.

Steadily, Francoist forces isolated the guerrillas. Most of their members were middle-aged or older by 1950, with the consequent detriment of their physical capacities accelerated by years of living exposed to the elements and the lack of proper medical and food supplies. In these last years, many attempted to escape to France. Of those who stayed in Spain, some were sentenced only to jail (some spent up to 20 years in prison), some were [[Summary execution|judged summarily]] and shot, and others died at the hands of the Guardia Civil through application of the [[Ley de Fugas]] ("law of fugitives").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marin Silvestre |first= Dolors |date= 2002 |title=Clandestinos. El maquis contra el franquismo |url= |location=[[Barcelona]] |publisher=Editorial Plaza &amp; Janés |page= |isbn=84-01-53053-9 |quote=''"…Las contrapartidas de la Guardia Civil empiezan a vaciar las zonas (…) La actuación obedece a la represión ejercida contra los enemigos políticos de su época por el aparato represor del franquismo. No se para en la detención de hombres, mujeres o niños: se les tortura o se les aplica la Ley de Fugas indiscriminadamente. Los cadáveres de las víctimas aparecen tirados en márgenes de caminos o en las puertas de los cementerios,"'' that is, "The countermeasures of the Guardia Civil began to empty the zones (…) The  means were in line with the repression exercised against the political enemies of their time by the repressive Franquista apparatus. It was not limited to the detention of men, women, or children: they tortured or applied the Ley de Fugas indiscriminately. The cadavers of the victims appeared shot on the edges of roads or the gates of cemeteries. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the period of major guerrilla activity ranged from 1938&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; through to the early 1950s, some groups continued to fight. The end was marked by the shooting deaths of [[Francisco Sabate Llopart]] (El Quico) in 1960, and [[Ramon Vila]] "''Caracremada''" in 1963, both in Catalonia, and {{Interlanguage link|José Castro Veiga|lt=|es|José Castro Veiga|WD=}} in Galicia in March 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso Domingo: ''El canto del búho.

==Areas of activity==
Maquis were active mostly in mountainous areas throughout the peninsula, preferring forests or areas of dense vegetation that would provide shelter and cover. Another important factor in the location of maqui groups and their survival was the social situation. They had to choose areas in which they could count on the collaboration of at least part of the population, given that without support they could hardly sustain a guerrilla group.

In areas of harsher weather, like in the mountains of León, the maquis would relatively often pass periods of time more or less "undercover", in small groups, in support houses in villages, especially during the winter months.

Among the areas of major maquis activity were the [[Green Spain|Cornisa Cantábrica]], from Galicia to Cantabria, especially the mountains of Asturias and the area north of León; the [[Iberian System]], specifically the area between the provinces of Teruel, Castellón, Valencia, and Cuenca; Centro, which consists of [[Extremadura]], the north of [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordova]], [[Ciudad Real]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and the mountains of the [[Sistema Central]]; and two independent areas in the south of Andalusia: [[Cádiz]] on one hand and [[Granada (province)|Granada]]-[[Málaga]] on the other.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; There was also activity in other areas, such as [[La Mancha]] and [[High Aragon]].

Armed resistance groups were also active in cities, although only prominently in [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]], [[Málaga]] and [[Granada]].&lt;ref&gt;Marco, Jorge: Hijos de una guerra. ''Los hermanos Quero y la resistencia antifranquista''. Granada, Comares, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In Madrid, the maquis' character was predominantly communist, supported by the PCE. Their activities did not, however, last long. On the other hand, the maquis acting in Barcelona, were mainly anarchists. This city was the last urban place to see activity of maquis. Attempts to extend the fight to other capitals like [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] and [[Bilbao]] were unsuccessful.

The generally rural and isolated character of the areas of guerrilla activity constituted an obstacle to the maquis' objectives. In effect, given the silence of the press and government on the situation, very few and scattered inhabitants of areas of maqui activity were actually aware of the conflict. The greater part of the Spanish population was ignorant of the war going on in their mountains.

=="Enlaces"==
Sustaining guerrilla activity was dependent on sectors of the population known as "''enlaces''" (literally, "links" or "relationships"). There were others called "passive militias", and "''guerrilleros del llano''" ("guerrillas of the plains"), who supplied aid, from food to armaments when necessary, as well as information. They would also deliver mail or correspondence for the groups.

The ''enlaces'' were much more exposed to the repressive actions of the government. However, they made up a source of combatants, since in the event of being discovered, their only chance to avoid being jailed was to flee to the mountains. Because of this, in the early 1950s when guerrilla activity was in its death throes, groups were still incorporating new men and women.

The number of ''enlaces'' was much higher than that of actual combatants. During the years of guerrilla activity, 20,000 people were arrested for collaborating with the maquis.&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso Domingo: ''El canto del búho. La vida en el monte de los guerrilleros antifranquistas''. OberonMemoria, Grupo ANAYA, Madrid 2002. {{ISBN|84-96052-03-6}}. ''"Frente a unos 6.000 o 7.000 guerrilleros, el número de enlaces fue diez, veinte veces mayor. Según cifras oficiales hubo 20.000 enlaces detenidos. Otros murieron a manos de las fuerzas de la Guardia Civil (…)"'', that is ''"Compared with some 6,000 or 7,000 guerrillas, the number of ''enlaces'' was ten, twenty times greater. According to official figures, there were 20,000 ''enlaces'' detained. Others died at the hands of the forces of the Guardia Civil (…)"''&lt;/ref&gt;
