'''Andrew Huang''' (born 8 April 1984) is a Canadian musician, video producer, and [[YouTube]] personality. He is best known for his "Song Challenge" video series, which invites viewers to dare him in feats of musicianship, as well as for several [[viral video]]s featuring his music. He is also known for his videos where he creates music using sounds from unconventional objects and instruments. Huang has released more than 50 albums of original music through [[DFTBA Records]] and independently, under his own name as well as under various pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/Andrew_Huang_The_YouTube_phenomenon_with_a_thousand_musical_works/49895/p1/ |title=Andrew Huang: The YouTube phenomenon with a thousand musical works |publisher=Cross Rhythms |date=November 30, 2012|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2020|March}}, his YouTube videos have more than 250 million views with more than 1.93 million subscribers.&lt;ref name="channel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/andrewhuang|title=Andrew Huang|website=youtube.com|publisher=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125214650/https://www.youtube.com/andrewhuang|archive-date=2014-11-25|url-status=dead|accessdate=August 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Huang was born and raised in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Creative Learning Centre Opens Its Doors: Impact Report 2014 |url=http://www.ashbury.ca/file/ashburynews/ANF2014_small.pdf |journal=Ashbury News |location=Ottawa |publisher=Ashbury College |date=Fall 2014 |access-date=March 16, 2015}} See page 36 of document: "Andrew Huang '02..."&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] at [[York University]] studying music and since then has been self-employed as a music producer and [[YouTube]] personality. He currently resides in [[Toronto]] with his wife, Esther.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/youtube-video-creators-in-the-spotlight-at-the-buffer-festival-1.1535626 |first=Corinne|last=Ton That|title=YouTube Video Creators in the Spotlight at the Buffer Festival |publisher=[[CTV Television Network]] |date=November 9, 2013 |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weeknd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/the-weeknd-s-can-t-feel-my-face-re-imagined-with-dental-utensils-1.3210914 |title=The Weeknd's 'Can't Feel My Face' re-imagined with dental utensils |publisher=CBC News |date=September 1, 2015 |accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career: ''Songs To Wear Pants To''==
After little success finding a part-time job during his university studies, Huang began auctioning off his songwriting skills to the highest bidder on [[eBay]]. The winning bidders received a custom song in any genre, written and recorded to their specifications.&lt;ref name="Tape Op"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tapeop.com/interviews/85/andrew-huang/|title=Tape Op Interviews|last=Assar|first=Vijith|date=September 2011|publisher=Tape Op - The Creative Recording Magazine|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the success of the eBay auctions, in April 2004, Huang launched the website ''Songs To Wear Pants To'', where visitors to the site could commission songs based on personal requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jpress.journalism.ryerson.ca/blog/2014/03/03/feature-draft-submission-outside-the-cubicle-andrew-huang-youtube-artist/ |title=Outside the cubicle: Andrew Huang, YouTube artist |date=March 3, 2014|last=Wang|first=H.|publisher=JPress Ryerson Journalism |access-date=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newgrounds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theinterviewer.newgrounds.com/news/post/511492/|date=August 26, 2010 |title=Interview with Andrew Huang |publisher=Newgrounds |access-date=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the site grew as Huang also began to take on commissions for free, provided the song idea interested him.&lt;ref name="Newgrounds"/&gt; The free songs often took on a comedic angle, either by poking fun at the person who requested the song, or simply because Huang would choose the most outrageous of submitted ideas to write about.&lt;ref name="Newgrounds" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ballad"&gt;{{cite news |last=Efron |first=Sarah |date=March 9, 2005 |title=Ballad for an albino kitten please |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/ballad-for-an-albino-kitten-please/article18217730/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |location=Toronto, Ontario |access-date=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; What resulted was an eclectic archive of hip hop, classical, doo wop, electronic, folk, rock and heavy metal tunes performed entirely by Huang.&lt;ref name="Ballad"/&gt;

==YouTube channel==
In October 2006, Huang started a channel on [[YouTube]] and began uploading fan-made music videos for the songs he created through ''Songs To Wear Pants To''.&lt;ref name="Tingen"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Tingen|first=Paul|date=May 2017|title=Internet Famous: How three musicians have craked the code and made it big on YouTube|url=http://www.audiotechnology.com.au/wp/index.php/internet-famous/|magazine=AudioTechnology Magazine|location=Australia|publisher=Alchemedia Publishing|access-date=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huang's channel is known for a wide variety of musical genres, influences, and projects, often thematically focused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2017/05/29/fidget-spinner-techno-music/#ZGIC1HHXo8q7 |author=Johnny Lieu|date=May 29, 2017|title=Yep, someone has made music from a fidget spinner |publisher=Mashable |accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J. Freedom du Lac"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/01/02/the-amazing-taylor-swift-jessie-j-and-pharrell-medley-made-with-a-bag-of-kale-and-other-household-items/ |author=J. Freedom du Lac|date=January 2, 2015|title=The amazing Taylor Swift, Jessie J and Pharrell medley made with a bag of kale and other household items |newspaper=The Washington Post |accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huang's videos often feature the artist himself, and frequently aim to showcase various elements of the song.

Huang is most widely known for his "Song Challenge" series, an extension of the idea behind ''Songs To Wear Pants To'', in which Huang takes on musical challenges submitted by viewers via [[social media]].&lt;ref name="J. Freedom du Lac" /&gt; In 2013, he released a rap song titled Vass Tunga, written in five different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ca.music.yahoo.com/blogs/sound-check/andrew-huang-david-brown-deliver-26-genres-music-155112174.html |title=Andrew Huang and David Brown deliver 26 genres of music |publisher=Yahoo Music |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huang occasionally uses unusual instruments to record [[cover version]]s of songs. One of his early efforts was released a week before [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' aired its series finale, featuring a cover of its unsettling title music using [[clandestine chemistry]] equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/08/13/watch-breaking-bad-theme-song-played-with-items-youd-find-in-a-meth-lab/ |title=Watch Breaking Bad Theme Song Played With Items You'd Find In A Meth Lab |magazine=Time Magazine |date= August 12, 2013|first=Sam|last=Grossman|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include a cover version of "[[99 Luftballons|99 Red Balloons]]" recorded with balloons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.people.com/article/99-red-balloons-played-on-red-balloons-video |first=Jelisa|last=Castrodale|date=September 12, 2014|title=Musician Plays '99 Red Balloons' on Red Balloons |magazine=People Magazine |accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/10/99-red-balloons-played-red-balloons_n_5797288.html  |title='99 Red Balloons' Played With Red Balloons Is Breathtaking|first=Ron|last=Dicker|date=September 10, 2014|work=Huffington Post |accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a cover of [[The Weeknd]]'s "[[Can't Feel My Face]]", using [[dental instruments]] filmed in his dentist's office.&lt;ref name="weeknd" /&gt;

Huang is currently signed to the YouTube network [[Fullscreen (company)|Fullscreen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tubefilter.com/2016/05/06/fullscreen-signs-andrew-huang-mia-stammer-carly-cristman-shannon-beveridge-cammie-scott-neels-visser/|title=Fullscreen Signs Andrew Huang, Mia Stammer, Carly Cristman, And More (Exclusive)|last=Weiss|first=Geoff|date=2016-05-06|work=Tubefilter|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collaborations==
Huang has collaborated with various other YouTube personalities, most notably with [[Boyinaband]] and [[Hannah Hart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/abagg/these-talented-guys-perform-26-genres-of-music-from-a-to-z#.ayVLgaO43 |title=These Talented Guys Perform 26-Genres of Music From A to Z |publisher=Buzzfeed |date=November 19, 2014|first=Allison|last=Bagg|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wetheunicorns.com/features/10-youtube-collabs-you-completely-forgot-happened/#gbY3KgUKmVCuRgsx.97|title=10 YouTube Collabs You Completely Forgot Ever Happened|last=Dryden|first=Liam|date=April 11, 2016|publisher=We The Unicorn|accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He provided instrumentation and songwriting for [[Hank Green and the Perfect Strangers]]' ''Incongruent'', and toured across the United States with the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punksinvegas.com/review-hank-green-perfect-strangers-incongruent-2014/ |author=Steven Matview |date=May 16, 2014|website=Punks In Vegas |title=Review: Hank Green and the Perfect Strangers ‘Incongruent’ (2014) |publisher=Punks In Vegas LLC |accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huang produced the music for [[Rhett and Link]]'s "Geeks vs. Nerds" music video in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/10/03/rhett-and-link-geek-vs-nerd/|title=Rhett And Link Use A Rap Battle To Settle Geek Vs. Nerd Debate|last=Gutelle|first=Sam|date=October 3, 2013|publisher=Tubefilter|accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Huang teamed up with musician and internet personality [[Gunnarolla]] to produce videos and music, including the popular series We Are What You Tweet and New State Plates. The pair have toured [[North America]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] together.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Huang and Gunnarolla later created [[electropop]] music duo Dreamz. As a duo, they entered [[CBC Music]]'s Searchlight contest under this new name, and their debut single "Come On" was selected as CBC [[Here and Now (Toronto)|Here and Now]]'s Song of the Week on March 11, 2013.&lt;ref name="Here and Now, program logs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radioshows/HERE_AND_NOW/20130312.shtml|title=CBC Radio Show Program Logs|work=cbc.ca|publisher=CBC Radio Show|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreamz reached the Top 16 of the contest representing Toronto.&lt;ref name="Here and Now top 16tourney list"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2013/3/Meet-our-Searchlight-Top-16-acts|title=Meet our Searchlight Top 16 acts|last=CBC Music|work=music.cbc.ca|publisher=CBC Music|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/|archivedate=1 March 2016|url-status=dead|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Searchlight Q with Jian Ghomeshi top 16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/q/contests/2013/03/18/searchlight-q/|title=Searchlight|work=cbc.ca|publisher=[[CBC Radio]]|accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Huang entered a contest run by [[American Express]] and won a chance to develop a music project with [[Emily Haines]], lead vocalist for Canadian indie band [[Metric (band)|Metric]]. He created an interactive installation featuring a series of videos that visitors could use to create [[ambient music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.theprovince.com/2012/03/25/andrew-huang-talks-experimental-music-with-vancouver-music-review/ |title=Andrew Huang Talks Experimental Music with Vancouver Music Review |newspaper=The Province |first=Alex|last=Wyder|date= March 25, 2012|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was exhibited at the [[Four Seasons Centre]] in Toronto during November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torontomusicscene.ca/tms-blog/watch-this-metrics-emily-haines-a-andrew-huang-talk-room-for-thought-music-and-tech.htm/ |title=Metric's Emily Haines &amp; Toronto's Andrew Huang talk Room For Thought, Ghost, music and tech |publisher=Toronto Music Scene |first=Sheena |last=Lyonnais |date=January 31, 2011 |accessdate=July 13, 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huang composed the anthem for [[WWF-Canada]]'s official [[Earth Hour]] in 2012 using lyrics from user-submitted suggestions, taking the title of "Canada's first official [[Crowdsourcing|crowd sourced]] song". Huang later performed the song live during Toronto's 2012 and 2013 [[Earth Day]] celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/03/30/canadas-earth-hour-song_n_1391760.html|title=Canada's Earth Hour Song Takes Place Among Inspiring Anthems|last=Tien Trinh|first=Brian Vinh|date=March 30, 2012|work=Huffington Post|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2018, Huang formed a duo with [[Rob Scallon]] called [[First of October (band)|First of October]], where Huang and Scallon record an entire 10-track album in 1 recording session. The group has made 2 albums, “Ten Hours” and “Gourmet Ravioli” both written and recorded in a day each. 

In June 2019, Andrew began a new project with YouTuber and science educator [[Hank Green]], Journey to the Microcosmos, a YouTube channel uploading short videos of microscope slides accompanied by voiceovers explaining different mechanisms of microscopic biological life. Huang produces all of the ambient tracks for the show's background music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbnbBWJtwsf0jLGUwX5Q3g|title=Journey to the Microcosmos|date=17 July 2019|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
