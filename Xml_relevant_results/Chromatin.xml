'''Chromatin''' is a complex of [[DNA]] and [[protein]] found in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monday|first1=Tanmoy|title=Characterization of the RNA content of chromatin|journal=Genome Res.|date=July 2010|volume=20|issue=7|pages=899–907|pmc=2892091|pmid=20404130|doi=10.1101/gr.103473.109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary function is [[DNA condensation|packaging]] long DNA molecules into more compact, denser structures.  This prevents the strands from becoming tangled and also plays important roles in reinforcing the DNA during [[cell division]], preventing [[DNA repair#DNA damage|DNA damage]], and regulating [[gene expression]] and [[DNA replication]]. During [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]], chromatin facilitates proper segregation of the [[chromosome]]s in [[anaphase]]; the characteristic shapes of chromosomes visible during this stage are the result of DNA being coiled into highly condensed chromatin.

The primary protein components of chromatin are [[histone]]s, which bind to DNA and function as "anchors" around which the strands are wound. In general, there are three levels of chromatin organization:
# DNA wraps around histone proteins, forming [[nucleosome]]s and the so-called "beads on a string" structure ([[euchromatin]]).
# Multiple histones wrap into a 30-[[nanometer]] fibre consisting of nucleosome arrays in their most compact form ([[heterochromatin]]).{{efn|Though it has been definitively established to exist ''in vitro'', the 30-[[nanometer]] fibre was not seen in recent X-ray studies of human mitotic chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hansen|first=Jeffrey|title=Human mitotic chromosome structure: what happened to the 30-nm fibre?|journal=The EMBO Journal|date=March 2012|volume=31|pages=1621–1623|doi=10.1038/emboj.2012.66|pmid=22415369|issue=7|pmc=3321215}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
# Higher-level [[DNA supercoiling]] of the 30-nm fiber produces the [[metaphase]] chromosome (during mitosis and meiosis).

Many organisms, however, do not follow this organization scheme. For example, [[spermatozoa]] and [[Bird|avian]] [[red blood cell]]s have more tightly packed chromatin than most eukaryotic cells, and [[trypanosomatid]] [[protozoa]] do not condense their chromatin into visible chromosomes at all. [[Prokaryotic]] cells have entirely different structures for organizing their DNA (the prokaryotic chromosome equivalent is called a [[genophore]] and is localized within the nucleoid region).

The overall structure of the chromatin network further depends on the stage of the [[cell cycle]]. During [[interphase]], the chromatin is structurally loose to allow access to [[RNA polymerase|RNA]] and [[DNA polymerase]]s that [[transcription (biology)|transcribe]] and replicate the DNA. The local structure of chromatin during interphase depends on the specific [[gene]]s present in the DNA. Regions of DNA containing genes which are actively transcribed ("turned on") are less tightly compacted and closely associated with RNA polymerases in a structure known as [[euchromatin]], while regions containing inactive genes ("turned off") are generally more condensed and associated with structural proteins in [[heterochromatin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chromatin.net/|title=Chromatin Network Home Page.|accessdate=2008-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epigenetic]] modification of the structural proteins in chromatin via [[methylation]] and [[acetylation]] also alters local chromatin structure and therefore gene expression. The structure of chromatin networks is currently poorly understood and remains an active area of research in [[molecular biology]].

==Dynamic chromatin structure and hierarchy==
[[File:Basic units of chromatin structure.svg|thumb|Basic units of chromatin structure]]

Chromatin undergoes various structural changes during a [[cell cycle]]. [[Histone]] proteins are the basic packer and arranger of chromatin and can be modified by various post-translational modifications to alter chromatin packing ([[Histone modification]]). Most of the modifications occur on the histone tail. The consequences in terms of chromatin accessibility and compaction depend both on the amino-acid that is modified and the type of modification. For example, Histone acetylation results in loosening and increased accessibility of chromatin for replication and transcription. Lysine tri-methylation can either be correlated with transcriptional activity (tri-methylation of histone H3 Lysine 4) or transcriptional repression and chromatin compaction (tri-methylation of histone H3 Lysine 9 or 27). Several studies suggested that different modifications could occur simultaneously. For example, it was proposed that a [[bivalent chromatin|bivalent]] structure (with tri-methylation of both Lysine 4 and 27 on histone H3) was involved in mammalian early development.&lt;ref&gt;

===DNA structure===
[[File:A-DNA, B-DNA and Z-DNA.png|thumb|left|300px|The structures of A-, B-, and Z-DNA.]]
{{main|Mechanical properties of DNA|Z-DNA}}
In nature, DNA can form three structures, [[A-DNA|A-]], [[B-DNA|B-]], and [[Z-DNA]]. A- and B-DNA are very similar, forming right-handed helices, whereas Z-DNA is a left-handed helix with a zig-zag phosphate backbone. Z-DNA is thought to play a specific role in chromatin structure and transcription because of the properties of the junction between B- and Z-DNA.

At the junction of B- and Z-DNA, one pair of bases is flipped out from normal bonding. These play a dual role of a site of recognition by many proteins and as a sink for torsional stress from [[RNA polymerase]] or nucleosome binding.
&lt;!---

[[File:B&amp;Z&amp;A DNA formula.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''Fig. 2:''' Alternative structural forms of DNA influencing chromatin structure]]

===Chromatin and Watson/Crick base pairing===
Crick and Watson's famous structure of [[DNA]] (called B-DNA) is only one of three possible structural forms (Fig. 2).

For the C-N bond between a base and its sugar, there are two different conformations. The anti-conformation occurs in all A- and B-DNAs as well as in Z-DNA where a Cytosine is present.
In case of a Guanine, Z-DNA takes the syn-conformation. The periodic change between a purine and pyrimidine along the strand of a Z-DNA accomplishes the alternating syn-anti-conformation characteristic of the zigzag structure of the Z-DNA helix. The yellow circles designated A, B, Z indicate the axes of the three possible types of DNA (Fig. 2).

[[File:B&amp;Z junction DNA.jpg|thumb|200px|'''Fig. 3:''' Structure of DNA with two B-Z DNA junctions: It encompasses 1. breakage of a hydrogen-bond, where a Guanine rotates around its glycosyl-bond and the sugar thereby transforms into its syn-conformation. 2. Rotation of the corresponding second base (Cytosine) involving rotation of the sugar around the sugar-phosphate-bond. 3. At the B-Z junction hydrogen-bonds remain broken and bases are extruded.]]

===Junction between B- and Z-DNA===
Chromatin regions near the transcription start site frequently contain DNA sequence motifs favourable for forming Z-DNA. Likewise, formation of Z-DNA near the promoter region stimulates transcription. Z-DNA is stabilized by binding specific proteins. Formation of Z-DNA from B-DNA is a dynamic process wherein B-DNA is the relaxed state. When a Z-DNA segment is formed two B-Z junctions form (Fig.3). The crystal structure of such junctions is known. At each junction the hydrogen bonds between a Watson/Crick base-pair is broken and the bases are extruded. Extrusion of a base from the helix is a well-known reaction performed by enzymes (i.e., DNA glycosylase) that edit or repair DNA during Base Excision Repair (BER). Crystal structures of extruded bases co-crystallized with Hha1 methyltransferase, human DNA repair protein AGT(O(6)-alkylguanine-DNAalkyltransferase), or bacteriophage T4 endonuclease V are similar to the extruded bases at B-Z junctions. Z-DNA may also provide a sink to absorb torsional strain following an RNA polymerase or a transient nucleosome. Also, Z-DNA may represent a signal for the recruitment of RNA-editing enzymes. It is possible that chromatin encompassing Z-DNA segments also affect replication." ---&gt;

===Nucleosomes and beads-on-a-string===
:''Main articles: [[Nucleosome]], [[Chromatosome]] and [[Histone]]''
[[File:Nucleosome 1KX5 2.png|thumb|left|150px|A cartoon representation of the nucleosome structure. From {{PDB|1KX5}}.]]
The basic repeat element of chromatin is the nucleosome, interconnected by sections of [[linker DNA]], a far shorter arrangement than pure DNA in solution.

In addition to the core histones, there is the linker histone, H1, which contacts the exit/entry of the DNA strand on the nucleosome. The nucleosome core particle, together with histone H1, is known as a chromatosome.  Nucleosomes, with about 20 to 60 base pairs of linker DNA, can form, under non-physiological conditions, an approximately 10&amp;nbsp;nm "beads-on-a-string" fibre. (Fig. 1-2). .

The nucleosomes bind DNA non-specifically, as required by their function in general DNA packaging.  There are, however, large DNA sequence preferences that govern nucleosome positioning.  This is due primarily to the varying physical properties of different DNA sequences: For instance, [[adenine]] and [[thymine]] are more favorably compressed into the inner minor grooves. This means nucleosomes can bind preferentially at one position approximately every 10 base pairs (the helical repeat of DNA)- where the DNA is rotated to maximise the number of A and T bases that will lie in the inner minor groove. (See [[mechanical properties of DNA]].)

===30-nanometer chromatin fiber===
[[File:30nm Chromatin Structures.png|thumb|right|200px|Two proposed structures of the 30 nm chromatin filament. &lt;br /&gt;Left: 1 start helix "solenoid" structure. &lt;br /&gt;Right: 2 start loose helix structure. &lt;br /&gt;Note: the histones are omitted in this diagram - only the DNA is shown.]]
With addition of H1, the beads-on-a-string structure in turn coils into a 30&amp;nbsp;nm diameter helical structure known as the 30&amp;nbsp;nm fibre or filament. The precise structure of the chromatin fiber in the cell is not known in detail, and there is still some debate over this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Annunziato|first1=Anthony T.|title=DNA Packaging: Nucleosomes and Chromatin|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-packaging-nucleosomes-and-chromatin-310|website=Scitable|publisher=Nature Education|accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This level of chromatin structure is thought to be the form of [[heterochromatin]], which contains mostly transcriptionally silent genes. EM (electron microscopy) studies have demonstrated that the 30&amp;nbsp;NM fiber is highly dynamic such that it unfolds into a 10&amp;nbsp;nm fiber ("beads-on-a-string") structure when transversed by an RNA polymerase engaged in transcription.

[[File:ChromatinFibers.png|thumb|left|250px|Four proposed structures of the 30&amp;nbsp;nm chromatin filament for DNA repeat length per nucleosomes ranging from 177 to 207 bp.
&lt;br /&gt;
Linker DNA in yellow and nucleosomal DNA in pink.]]
The existing models commonly accept that the nucleosomes lie perpendicular to the axis of the fibre, with linker histones arranged internally.
A stable 30&amp;nbsp;nm fibre relies on the regular positioning of nucleosomes along DNA. Linker DNA is relatively resistant to bending and rotation. This makes the length of linker DNA critical to the stability of the fibre, requiring nucleosomes to be separated by lengths that permit rotation and folding into the required orientation without excessive stress to the DNA.
In this view, different lengths of the linker DNA should produce different folding topologies of the chromatin fiber. Recent theoretical work, based on electron-microscopy images&lt;ref&gt;

===Spatial organization of chromatin in the cell nucleus===
&lt;!--- Too speculative for an article: "[[File:Nucleus &amp; Chromatin Territorial Structure.jpg|thumb|200px|left|'''Fig. 4:''' Hypothetical Model of the Territorial Organization of Chromatin in the Cell Nucleus. The diagram (Fig. 4) represents a model of a cell (gray oval) with a nucleus (dark gray oval). Two chromosomes are shown as chromatin fibers (yellow and red lines). Proteins are represented as small ovals. Note the association of the chromatin components with the nuclear membrane. Chromosomes are territorially interlinked by chromatin protein complexes (scaffold proteins see above).]]" ---&gt;

The spatial arrangement of the chromatin within the nucleus is not random - specific regions of the chromatin can be found in certain territories. Territories are, for example, the [[Nuclear lamina|lamina]]-associated domains (LADs), and the [[topologically associating domain]]s (TADs), which are bound together by protein complexes.&lt;ref name="pmid24804566"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicodemi M, Pombo A |title=Models of chromosome structure |journal=Curr.

===Cell-cycle dependent structural organization===

[[File:Condensation and resolution of human sister chromatids in early mitosis.svg|thumb|Condensation and resolution of human sister chromatids in early mitosis]]

# '''Interphase''': The structure of chromatin during [[interphase]] of [[mitosis]] is optimized to allow simple access of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[DNA repair]] factors to the DNA while compacting the DNA into the [[nucleus (cell)|nucleus]]. The structure varies depending on the access required to the DNA. [[Genes]] that require regular access by [[RNA polymerase]] require the looser structure provided by euchromatin.

# '''Metaphase''': The [[metaphase]] structure of chromatin differs vastly to that of [[interphase]]. It is optimised for physical strength{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} and manageability, forming the classic [[chromosome]] structure seen in [[karyotype]]s. The structure of the condensed chromatin is thought to be loops of 30&amp;nbsp;nm fibre to a central scaffold of proteins. It is, however, not well-characterised.The physical strength of chromatin is vital for this stage of division to prevent shear damage to the DNA as the daughter chromosomes are separated. To maximise strength the composition of the chromatin changes as it approaches the centromere, primarily through alternative histone H1 analogues. During mitosis, although most of the chromatin is tightly compacted, there are small regions that are not as tightly compacted. These regions often correspond to promoter regions of genes that were active in that cell type prior to entry into chromatosis. The lack of compaction of these regions is called [[bookmarking]], which is an [[epigenetic]] mechanism believed to be important for transmitting to daughter cells the "memory" of which genes were active prior to entry into mitosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Xing H, Vanderford NL, Sarge KD |title=The TBP-PP2A mitotic complex bookmarks genes by preventing condensin action |journal=Nat. Cell Biol. |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=1318–23 |date=November 2008 |pmid=18931662 |pmc=2577711 |doi=10.1038/ncb1790 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[bookmarking]] mechanism is needed to help transmit this memory because transcription ceases during [[mitosis]].

==Chromatin and bursts of transcription==

Chromatin and its interaction with enzymes has been researched, and a conclusion being made is that it is relevant and an important factor in gene expression. Vincent G. Allfrey, a professor at Rockefeller University, stated that RNA synthesis is related to histone acetylation.&lt;ref name="pmid14172992"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=ALLFREY VG, FAULKNER R, MIRSKY AE |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=51 |issue= 5|pages=786–94 |date=May 1964 |pmid=14172992 |pmc=300163 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.51.5.786|bibcode=1964PNAS...51..786A |title=Acetylation and Methylation of Histones and Their Possible Role in the Regulation of RNA Synthesis }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lysine amino acid attached to the end of the histones is positively charged. The acetylation of these tails would make the chromatin ends neutral, allowing for DNA access.

When the chromatin decondenses, the DNA is open to entry of molecular machinery. Fluctuations between open and closed chromatin may contribute to the discontinuity of transcription, or [[transcriptional bursting]].  Other factors are probably involved, such as the association and dissociation of transcription factor complexes with chromatin.  The phenomenon, as opposed to simple probabilistic models of transcription, can account for the high variability in gene expression occurring between cells in isogenic populations&lt;ref name="pmid22944281"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaochar S, Tu BP |title=Gatekeepers of chromatin: Small metabolites elicit big changes in gene expression |journal=Trends Biochem.

===Alternative chromatin organizations===

During metazoan [[spermiogenesis]], the [[spermatid]]'s chromatin is remodeled into a more spaced-packaged, widened, almost crystal-like structure. This process is associated with the cessation of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and involves [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] protein exchange. The histones are mostly displaced, and replaced by [[protamine]]s (small, [[arginine]]-rich proteins).&lt;ref name="pmid23213436"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Vries M, Ramos L, Housein Z, De Boer P |title=Chromatin remodelling initiation during human spermiogenesis |journal=Biol Open |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=446–57 |date=May 2012 |pmid=23213436 |pmc=3507207 |doi=10.1242/bio.2012844 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that in yeast, regions devoid of histones become very fragile after transcription; HMO1, an [[HMG-box]] protein, helps in stabilizing nucleosomes-free chromatin.&lt;ref name="pmid25063301"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murugesapillai D, McCauley MJ, Huo R, Nelson Holte MH, Stepanyants A, Maher LJ, Israeloff NE, Williams MC | title = DNA bridging and looping by HMO1 provides a mechanism for stabilizing nucleosome-free chromatin | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 42 | issue = 14 | pages = 8996–9004 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25063301 | pmc = 4132745 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gku635 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid28303166"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murugesapillai D, McCauley MJ, Maher LJ, Williams MC | title = Single-molecule studies of high-mobility group B architectural DNA bending proteins | journal = Biophysical Reviews | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–40 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28303166 | pmc = 5331113 | doi = 10.1007/s12551-016-0236-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chromatin and DNA repair==

The packaging of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin presents a barrier to all DNA-based processes that require recruitment of enzymes to their sites of action. To allow the critical cellular process of DNA repair, the chromatin must be remodeled.

==Chromatin and knots==

It has been a puzzle how decondensed interphase chromosomes remain essentially unknotted. The natural expectation is that in the presence of type II DNA topoisomerases that permit passages of double-stranded DNA regions through each other, all chromosomes should reach the state of topological equilibrium. The topological equilibrium in highly crowded interphase chromosomes forming chromosome territories would result in formation of highly knotted chromatin fibres. However, Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) methods revealed that the decay of contacts with the genomic distance in interphase chromosomes is practically the same as in the crumpled globule state that is formed when long polymers condense without formation of any knots. To remove knots from highly crowded chromatin, one would need an active process that should not only provide the energy to move the system from the state of topological equilibrium but also guide topoisomerase-mediated passages in such a way that knots would be efficiently unknotted instead of making the knots even more complex. It has been shown that the process of chromatin-loop extrusion is ideally suited to actively unknot chromatin fibres in interphase chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;

==Chromatin: alternative definitions==

The term, introduced by [[Walther Flemming]], has multiple meanings:
# '''Simple and concise definition:''' Chromatin is a macromolecular complex of a DNA macromolecule and protein macromolecules (and RNA). The proteins package and arrange the DNA and control its functions within the cell nucleus.
# '''A biochemists’ operational definition:''' Chromatin is the DNA/protein/RNA complex extracted from eukaryotic lysed interphase nuclei. Just which of the multitudinous substances present in a nucleus will constitute a part of the extracted material partly depends on the technique each researcher uses. Furthermore, the composition and properties of chromatin vary from one cell type to the another, during development of a specific cell type, and at different stages in the cell cycle.
# '''The ''DNA + histone = chromatin'' definition:''' The DNA double helix in the cell nucleus is packaged by special proteins termed histones. The formed protein/DNA complex is called chromatin. The basic structural unit of chromatin is the nucleosome.

The first definition allows for "chromatins" to be defined in other domains of life like bacteria and archaea, using any DNA-binding proteins that [[DNA condensation|condenses the molecule]]. These proteins are usually referred to [[Nucleoid#Nucleoid-associated_proteins_(NAPs)|nucleoid-associated proteins]] (NAPs); examples include AsnC/LrpC with HU. In addition, some archaea do produce nucleosomes from proteins homologous to eukaryotic histones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luijsterburg |first1=Martijn S. |last2=White |first2=Malcolm F. |last3=van Driel |first3=Roel |last4=Dame |first4=Remus Th. |title=The Major Architects of Chromatin: Architectural Proteins in Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes |journal=Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |date=8 January 2009 |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=393–418 |doi=10.1080/10409230802528488}}&lt;/ref&gt;
