{{History of Switzerland}}

The territory of modern [[Switzerland]] was a part of the [[Roman Republic]] and [[Roman Empire|Empire]] for a period of about six centuries, beginning with the step-by-step conquest of the area by Roman armies from the 2nd century BC and ending with the decline of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century AD.

The mostly [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes of the area were subjugated by successive Roman campaigns aimed at control of the strategic routes from Italy across the Alps to the [[Rhine]] and into [[Gaul]], most importantly by [[Julius Caesar]]'s defeat of the largest tribal group, the [[Helvetii]], in the [[Gallic Wars]] in 58&amp;nbsp;BC. Under the ''[[Pax Romana]]'', the area was smoothly integrated into the prospering Empire, and its population [[Romanization (cultural)|assimilated]] into the wider [[Gallo-Roman culture]] by the 2nd century AD, as the Romans enlisted the native aristocracy to engage in local government, built a network of roads connecting their newly established colonial cities and divided up the area among the [[Roman province]]s.

Roman civilization began to retreat from Swiss territory when it became a border region again after the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. Roman control weakened after 401 AD, but did not entirely disappear until the mid-5th century after which the area began to be occupied by [[Germanic peoples]].

==Switzerland prior to the Roman conquest==
{{main|Switzerland in the Iron Age}}
The [[Swiss plateau]], within the natural borders of the [[Alps]] to the South and East, [[Lake Geneva]] and the [[Rhône]] to the west and the [[Rhine]] to the north, was recognized as a contiguous territory by [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref name="Ducrey 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ducrey|first=Pierre|title=Geschichte der Schweiz und der Schweizer|publisher=Schwabe|year=2006|edition=4|pages=55|chapter=Die ersten Kulturen zwischen Alpen und Jura|isbn=3-7965-2067-7|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This area had been dominated by the [[La Tène culture]] since the 5th century BC, settled by a mostly [[Celts|Celtic]] population ([[Gauls]]), of which the [[Helvetii]] were the most numerous, but which also included the [[Rauraci]] in north-west Switzerland centered on [[Basel]], and the [[Allobroges]] around [[Geneva]]. South of the Swiss plateau were the [[Nantuates]], [[Seduni]] and [[Veragri]] in the [[Valais]], the [[Lepontii]] in the [[Ticino]], while the [[Raetia]]ns controlled the [[Grisons]] as well as large areas around it.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 55" /&gt;

==The Roman conquest==

===Early contact===
The first part of what is now Switzerland to fall to Rome was the southern [[Ticino]], annexed after the Roman victory over the [[Insubres]] in 222&amp;nbsp;BC. The territory of the [[Allobroges]] around [[Geneva]] came under Roman sway by 121&amp;nbsp;BC and was incorporated into the province of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] prior to the [[Gallic Wars]] (58–51&amp;nbsp;BC).&lt;ref name="Ducrey 58"/&gt;

In around 110&amp;nbsp;BC, two Helvetic tribes under [[Divico]] – the [[Tigurini]] and the [[Tougeni]], sometimes identified with the [[Teutons]] – joined the wandering [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Cimbri]] on a march to the West. In the course of the [[Cimbrian War]] they defeated a Roman force under [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]] at the [[Battle of Burdigala]] in 107&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref name="Ducrey 54" &gt;Ducrey, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; but after the Roman victory over the Teutons at [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae|Aquae Sextiae]] in 102&amp;nbsp;BC, the Tigurini returned to settle in the Swiss Plateau.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 54" /&gt;

===Defeat of the Helvetii===
{{main|Gallic Wars|Helvetii}}
In 61&amp;nbsp;BC, the Helvetii, led by [[Orgetorix]], decided to leave their lands and move to the West, burning their settlements behind them – twelve [[Oppidum|oppida]], according to Caesar, and some 400 villages. They were decisively beaten by Caesar in the [[Battle of Bibracte]] in 58&amp;nbsp;BC. After their surrender, Caesar sent the Helvetii home, according them the status of ''[[foederati]]'' or Roman allies, but not yet (as has previously been believed) fully subjugating them to Roman sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 58" &gt;Ducrey, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caesar's policy aimed at controlling the territory west of the [[Jura mountains|Jura]] and [[Rhine]], as well as at blocking the potential incursion routes from the East along the Jura.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 59" &gt;Ducrey, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; The Raetians, described as savage warriors by [[Strabo]], continued to launch incursions into the Swiss Plateau and also had to be contained.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 59" /&gt; To that end, Caesar charged the Helvetii and the Rauraci with defending their territory and established two colonies of veterans – one, the [[Colonia Julia Equestris]] (now [[Nyon]]) on the shores of [[Lake Geneva]] and the other through [[Lucius Munatius Plancus]] in northwestern Switzerland, preceding the larger [[Augusta Raurica]] founded by Augustus in around 6&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 60" &gt;Ducrey, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conquest of the Alps===
[[File:Römische Provinzen im Alpenraum ca 14 n Chr.png|thumb|left|200px|Central Europe in 14&amp;nbsp;AD: Switzerland is divided between the provinces of [[Raetia et Vindelicia]] and [[Gallia Belgica]].]]
Caesar's attempt to open the [[Great St Bernard Pass]] for Roman traffic failed in 57&amp;nbsp;BC due to strong opposition by the local [[Veragri]].&lt;ref name="Ducrey 61" &gt;Ducrey, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Concerted and successful efforts to gain control over the Alpine region were undertaken by his successor, [[Augustus]], as the rapid development of [[Lugdunum]] (Lyon) made the establishment of a safe and direct route from Gaul to Italy a priority.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 61" /&gt;

In 25&amp;nbsp;BC, an army under [[Aulus Terentius Varro Murena]] wiped out the [[Salassi]] in the [[Aosta Valley]].&lt;ref name="Ducrey 61" /&gt; At some time between 25 and 7&amp;nbsp;BC – either following the Aosta campaign or, more likely, in the course of the conquest of [[Raetia]] in 15&amp;nbsp;BC – a campaign also subjugated the Celtic tribes of the Valais and opened the Great St Bernard Pass.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 62" &gt;Ducrey, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

That conquest was a consequence of the Augustan imperative of securing the Imperial borders. To effectively control the [[Alps]] as the shield of northern Italy, Rome needed to control both flanks of the mountain range. Thus it had to extend its power to the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]], thereby also opening a direct route to [[Germania]] and all of Central Europe.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 62" /&gt; The last obstacle in this path were the Raetians. After a first expedition against them by [[Publius Silius Nerva]] in 16&amp;nbsp;BC, a more thorough campaign by [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and the later emperor [[Tiberius]] brought Raetia – and thereby all of Switzerland – firmly under Roman control.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 62" /&gt;

The [[tropaeum alpium]], built by Augustus in 7&amp;nbsp;BC to celebrate his conquest of the Alps, lists among the defeated peoples the tribes of Raetia and of the Valais, but not the Helvetii. It appears that they were absorbed peacefully into the Empire during the first century AD, except for their part in the conflicts of the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], AD&amp;nbsp;69.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 63" &gt;Ducrey, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman Switzerland==
The history of Switzerland under Roman rule was, from the [[Augustus|Augustan period]] up until 260&amp;nbsp;AD, a time of exceptional peace and prosperity. The ''[[Pax Romana]]''&lt;ref name=HDS-Empire&gt;{{HDS|8248|Empire romain|author=Regula Frei-Stolba}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made possible by the protection of well-defended and distant Imperial borders and a peaceful and smooth [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] of the local population.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 74" &gt;Ducrey, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans [[urbanization|urbanized]] the territory with numerous settlements and built a network of high-quality [[Roman roads]] connecting them,&lt;ref name="Ducrey 89" &gt;Ducrey, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for the integration of ''Helvetia'' into the imperial economy.
===Roman settlements===
[[File:Historische Karte CH Rome 1.png|thumb|Political borders and settlements in the area of Switzerland, 90 to 284&amp;nbsp;AD]]
While the Roman presence was always strong in the Alps, where the crucial North-South connection had to be kept open, the [[Swiss plateau]] was not really Romanized until decades after the conquest.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 63" /&gt; The principal Roman settlements in Switzerland were the cities of [[Iulia Equestris]] ([[Nyon]]), [[Aventicum]] ([[Avenches]]), [[Augusta Raurica]] ([[Augst]]) and [[Vindonissa]] ([[Windisch]]).&lt;ref name="Ducrey 83" &gt;Ducrey, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence has also been found of almost twenty Roman villages (''[[Vicus (Rome)|vici]]'') established in the 1st to 3rd century AD, as well as hundreds of [[Roman villa|villa]]s of varying sizes built in the western and central part of the [[Swiss Plateau]].&lt;ref name="Ducrey 83" /&gt; The known ''vici'' include:&lt;ref name="Ducrey 70" &gt;Ducrey, p. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;
* in the [[Romandie]]: [[Yverdon-les-Bains|Eburodunum]] ([[Yverdon-les-Bains]]), [[Genava]] ([[Geneva]]), [[Lousonna]] ([[Lausanne]]), [[Minnodurum]] ([[Moudon]]), [[Urba]] ([[Orbe]]), [[Uromagus]] ([[Oron-la-Ville|Oron]]), [[Viviscus]] ([[Vevey]]);
* in the [[Valais]]: Acaunum or [[Agaunum]] ([[Saint-Maurice, Switzerland|St. Maurice]]), [[Forum Claudii Vallensium]] ([[Martigny]]), [[Pennelocus]], [[Sedunum]] ([[Sitten]]), [[Tarnaiae]] ([[Massongex]]);
* in central and northern Switzerland: [[Aquae Helveticae]] ([[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]]), [[Pfyn|Ad Fines]] ([[Pfyn]]), [[Bern]], [[Arialbinnum]] ([[Basel]]), [[Cambiodunum]] ([[Irgenhausen]]), [[Dietikon]], [[Iuliomagus]] ([[Schleitheim]]), [[Centum Prata]] ([[Kempraten]]), [[Lenzburg]], [[Lunnern]], [[Olten]], [[Petinesca]] ([[Payerne|Peterlingen]]), [[Pierre Pertuis]], [[Salodurum]] or Solodurum ([[Solothurn]]), [[Tasgetium]] or Tasgaetium ([[Eschenz]]), [[Tenedo]] ([[Zurzach]]), [[Turicum (Zürich)|Turicum]] ([[Zürich]]), [[Vitudurum]] or Vitodurum ([[Winterthur]]);
* in Raetia: [[Ad Rhenum]] ([[Rheineck]]), [[Arbor Felix]] ([[Arbon]]), [[Bilitio]] ([[Bellinzona]]), [[Curia]] ([[Chur]]), [[Magia]] ([[Maienfeld]]), [[Lapidaria (vicus)|Lapidaria]], [[Tinnetie]] or Tinnetio ([[Tinizong-Rona]]).

The colonies of Nyon and Augusta Raurica at first had little cultural influence beyond their immediate surroundings. After Roman military defeats in [[Germania]] in 12–9&amp;nbsp;BC and 6–9&amp;nbsp;AD, the frontier was moved back to the Rhine and guarded by eight legions, of which one, originally ''[[Legio XIII Gemina]]'', was based in the permanent camp of [[Vindonissa]] ([[Windisch]]).&lt;ref name="Ducrey 68" &gt;Ducrey, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aventicum]] ([[Avenches]]) was likely the capital of the Helvetii since its founding at the beginning of the 1st century.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 69" &gt;Ducrey, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 40s, it benefited from the traffic brought over the St Bernard pass over a street expanded by [[Claudius]],&lt;ref name="Ducrey 69" /&gt; and in 71 it acquired the status of a Roman colony and of an allied city. This is believed to have been a favor of [[Vespasian]] for the city in which he had lived for a time, or a measure to better control the Helvetii after the events of 69 by implanting a colony of veterans in their midst.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 72" &gt;Ducrey, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
The Alps were first administered by a [[legatus pro praetore]] in [[Augusta Vindelicorum]] ([[Augsburg]]), then by the procurator of the new province of [[Raetia]].&lt;ref name="Ducrey 64" &gt;Ducrey, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Valais]] was split from Raetia by [[Claudius]] in AD&amp;nbsp;43 and merged with the province of ''Alpes Graiae'' to form a new province, [[Alpes Graiae et Poeninae]].&lt;ref name="Ducrey 64" /&gt;

As for the Swiss plateau, its western and central part up to ''Ad Fines'' ([[Pfyn]]) was administratively part of the province of [[Belgica]] and for military purposes part of [[Germania Superior]]. Its eastern part belonged to Raetia.

This division, established by Augustus in 22&amp;nbsp;BC, was accompanied by a redistribution of tribal settlement areas.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 68" /&gt; It remained essentially unchanged until [[Diocletian]]'s reforms in the third century,&lt;ref name=HDS-Provincia&gt;{{HDS|9813|Provincia|author=Alfred Hirt}}&lt;/ref&gt; when parts of Switzerland each belonged to the provinces of [[Sequania]], [[Vienna]], [[Raetia Prima]], [[Liguria]] and ''Alpes Graiae et Poeninae''.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 103" &gt;Ducrey, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government===
The colonies of Nyon, Aventicum and Augusta Raurica were governed under republican constitutions similar to that of Rome.&lt;ref name=HDS-Colonia&gt;{{HDS|7868|Colonia|author=Regula Frei-Stolba}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most governmental powers were exercised by a pair of magistrates, the ''[[duoviri]]'', elected annually first by all citizens older than 25, and in later times by the city council or ''[[ordo decurionum]]''.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 91" /&gt; The 100 members of this council, which corresponded to the [[Roman Senate]], were selected by the duomviri among former officials or priests according to their wealth, and held office for life.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 92" /&gt;

Augusta Raurica and Aventicum were also the ''[[civitates]]'', or capitals, of the non-Roman tribes of the [[Rauraci]] and [[Helvetii]], respectively. In that capacity, the magistrates of Aventicum, as ''duoviri coloniae Helvetiorum'', also governed the entire Helvetic population, which had the legal status of ''[[incolae]]'' (inhabitants) invested with the [[Latin Right]].&lt;ref name="Ducrey 92" /&gt; The rights of the Roman ''[[Colonus (person)|coloni]]'', or colonists, were represented by a special authority, the ''curatores colonorum Aventicensum'' ("Heads of the colonists of Aventicum"). Moreover, the Roman citizens of the entire territory established the ''cives Romani conventus Helvetici'' ("Association of Roman citizens in Helvetia").&lt;ref name="Ducrey 92" &gt;Ducrey, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[civitas]]'' (tribal community) of the [[Helvetii]] was similar to that of the Celtic tribes of the [[Valais]], which were merged into a single ''civitas Vallensis'' probably around 40&amp;nbsp;AD, and given [[Forum Claudii Vallensium]] ([[Martigny]]) as their capital.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 93" &gt;Ducrey, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the modern [[Ticino]] belonged to the colony of [[Comum]] ([[Como]]), founded in the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name="HDS-Colonia" /&gt; On the local level, the basic administrative units were the ''[[Vicus|vici]]'', replacing the Helvetic ''pagi'', or tribes, which were dissolved at the time of colonization.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 92" /&gt; These villages enjoyed a certain autonomy and were governed by popularly elected magistrates (''magistri'' or ''curatores'').&lt;ref name="Ducrey 92" /&gt;

While the governmental system in the central and western part of Switzerland, as described above, is well documented, nothing of substance is known about the political and administrative system in eastern [[Raetia]]. However, records of the time show that a great number of local nobles held political and religious offices in Raetia, indicating that the Romans successfully co-opted the local elite.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 93" /&gt;

===Culture and society===
[[File:Avenches - arènes.jpg|thumb|The [[arena]] of [[Aventicum]]]]
[[File:Theater Kaiseraugst.jpg|thumb|The theatre of Augusta Raurica]]
{{see also|Gallo-Roman culture}}
Testaments of Roman culture such as baths, floor heating and imported goods (pottery, glass, religious icons and artworks) have been found in even the poorest Roman era dwellings, indicating that Romanization was effective at all levels of society.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 85" &gt;Ducrey, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[thermae|Roman public baths]] were found in all villages, [[temple]]s with integrated [[theater]]s – showing animal or [[gladiator]]ial combat – in most.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 78" &gt;Ducrey, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the superimposition of Roman culture on the local population appears to have been unproblematic and thorough, the Celtic traditions did not disappear entirely, resulting in a fusion of Roman and local culture that characterized all aspects of society.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 74" /&gt; [[Latin language|Latin]], the language of government and instruction, only gradually replaced the local [[Celtic language|Celtic]] dialects in everyday use.&lt;ref name=Presence&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissworld.org/en/history/prehistory_to_romans/life_under_the_romans/|title=Swiss History: Life under the Romans|publisher=[[Presence Switzerland]] / [[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]]|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local artworks and religious icons of the period exhibit influences of ornamental [[Celtic art]], classical Greco-Roman art and even Oriental styles from the far reaches of the Empire.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 100" &gt;Ducrey, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;  An important incentive for the local people to Romanize was the perspective of obtaining the various degrees of [[Roman citizenship]] and the rights conferred thereby, including the right to vote, to hold public office and to render military service.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 91" &gt;Ducrey, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hundreds of ''villae'' found in Switzerland, some very luxurious, attest to the existence of a wealthy and cultured upper class of landowners.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 84" &gt;Ducrey, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Many ''villae'' belonged not to Roman immigrants, but to members of the Celtic aristocracy who continued to hold their lands and their rank after the Roman conquest.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 83" &gt;Ducrey, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Presence" /&gt; Of the lower classes, much less is known, although there are inscriptions attesting to the existence of guilds (''[[collegia]]'') of boat skippers, doctors, teachers and traders, as well as to the existence of a [[Slavery in ancient Rome|trade in slaves]].&lt;ref name="Ducrey 94" &gt;Ducrey, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===

====Polytheism====
[[File:Picswiss BL-44-04.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Hercules]] in Augusta Raurica]]
In the course of Romanization, the [[Celtic polytheism]] of the local tribes was merged – [[Syncretism|syncretized]] – with the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]. The Celtic deities came to be worshiped under the names of their Roman counterparts. Thus [[Lugus]] was replaced by [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], [[Belenus]] by [[Apollo]], [[Taranis]] by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and so forth, in a practice called ''interpretatio romana'' by [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], who pioneered it.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 96" &gt;Ducrey, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman gods also acquired the names of local gods as [[epithet]]s; thus [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] was venerated as ''Mars [[Caturix]]'', Mercury as ''Mercurius [[Cissonius]]'' and Jupiter as ''Jupiter [[Poeninus]]'' after the god of the [[Pennine Alps]].&lt;ref name="Ducrey 96" /&gt;

As oriental religions grew more popular in the later Empire – unlike the traditional Roman cults, they promised rewards in the [[afterlife]]&lt;ref name="Ducrey 98" &gt;Ducrey, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; – they also percolated into Gaul. Artifacts related to the cults of gods such as [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], [[Serapis]], [[Kybele]], [[Serapios]], [[Dionysos]] or [[Mithras]] have been found at the site of every Roman settlement in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 98" /&gt;

The great significance of religion in the culture of Roman Switzerland is illustrated by the imposing size and central location of the Roman temples in the cities, as well as by the great number of religious artifacts found by archaeologists.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 96" /&gt; As everywhere in the Empire, the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]] was practiced in Switzerland; it had a particularly prominent temple in the center of the ''[[Forum (Roman)|forum]]'' of Nyon.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 97" &gt;Ducrey, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====
The first clear testaments to [[Christianity|Christian]] communities in Switzerland date after 313, when the religion was officially tolerated with the [[Edict of Milan]]. It is however certain that, as in Gaul, the Christian faith had already had adherents for some time prior to 313.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 98" /&gt;

The first [[bishop]] in Switzerland was either [[Justinianus]], bishop of the Rauricans, in 340 (his historicity is not certain) or [[Theodorus of Octodurus|Theodorus]], bishop of [[Octodurus]], in 381 or earlier.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 98" /&gt; The first Christian religious buildings date to the 4th century; they are found in [[Geneva]], [[Chur]] and [[Saint-Maurice, Switzerland|Saint-Maurice]], known for the legend of the [[Theban Legion]].&lt;ref name="Ducrey 98" /&gt;

==Decline of Roman civilization in Switzerland==
[[File:Roman column - Nyon, Vaud, Switzerland.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of the colony of Nyon overlooking [[Lake Geneva]]]]

===The catastrophe of 260===
The order and prosperity that the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' had brought to Switzerland ended, as elsewhere in the Empire, with the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. In 260, when the [[Gallic Empire]] briefly seceded from Rome, the emperor [[Gallienus]] withdrew the legions from the Rhine to fight the usurper [[Ingenuus]], allowing the warlike [[Alemanni]] to enter the Swiss plateau.  There, cities, villages and most ''villae'' were raided or sacked by marauding bands.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 101" &gt;Ducrey, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The numerous caches of coins recovered from the period between 250 and 280 attest to the severity of the crisis. Only the [[Valais]], shielded by mountains, escaped these predations.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 101" /&gt;

===Borderlands===
[[File:Irgenhausen-Kastell-01.jpg|thumb|Roman [[Irgenhausen Castrum]] near [[Irgenhausen]]]]
As the Empire's frontiers receded to the Rhine, Switzerland once again became a border area. Its defenses were strengthened, especially under [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I|Constantine]], who rebuilt the roads and built castles (''[[castra]]'') alongside.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 101" /&gt; Numerous fortifications were built along the Rhine border and further south, providing for a [[defense in depth]].&lt;ref name="Ducrey 102" &gt;Ducrey, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The border fortifications were completed by [[Valentinian I]] in 371, who established a chain of watchtowers along the Rhine from [[Lake Constance]] to [[Basel]], with each tower no more than {{convert|2|km|mi|sp=us}} away from the next one.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 102" /&gt;

But even these efforts could not restore peace and order in Switzerland, and numerous settlements were abandoned as their inhabitants fled to more defensible places or to the South. Urban culture faded away as the cities of Nyon and Augusta Raurica were permanently abandoned during the 4th century, the stones of their ruins serving to fortify [[Geneva]] and [[Basel]].&lt;ref name="Ducrey 104" &gt;Ducrey, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Aventicum never recovered from its pillages: [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] noted in around 360 that "the city was once very illustrious, as its half-ruined buildings attest."&lt;ref name="Ducrey 101" /&gt;

===Transition to the Middle Ages===

The Roman era of Switzerland is traditionally held to have ended in 401&amp;nbsp;AD, when [[Stilicho]] withdrew all troops from the Rhine and the Danube.&lt;ref name="Ducrey 105" &gt;Ducrey, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been argued that the withdrawal was only temporary and partial, and that Roman control of these rivers was reestablished in 411–413 with the assistance of tribes moving south from Germania.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Burn, Barbarians within the Gates of Rome, A Study of Roman Military Policy with the barbarians, CA 375-425, 1994, pp. 129-147&lt;/ref&gt;

In any case, the fifth century saw the apparently non-violent takeover of western Switzerland by the [[Burgundians]] (placed there by [[Flavius Aetius]] in 443 as a shield against the invading [[Huns]]) and of Northern and Central Switzerland by the [[Alamanni]],&lt;ref name="Ducrey 105" /&gt; a move not opposed by either absent or weakened Roman forces. These settlements established the most important cultural and linguistic division in modern Switzerland: the Burgundian areas eventually became the French-speaking ''[[Romandie]]'', while the people in the larger Eastern half – called ''la suisse alémanique'' in French –  still speak variants of [[Alemannic German]].

[[Raetia]] maintained its Roman traditions longer than the rest of Switzerland, but most of it was eventually assimilated as well, leaving only a small territory where a [[Vulgar Latin]] dialect, [[Romansh language|Romansh]], is spoken to this day. The assassination of Aetius in 454 and the subsequent retreat of Roman forces to the south of the Alps marked the definitive end of Roman power in Switzerland, and the beginning of the transition to the [[Middle Ages]].
