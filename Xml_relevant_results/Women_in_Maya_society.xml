      <text bytes="30863" xml:space="preserve">Ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] women had an important role in [[society]]: beyond propagating the [[culture]] through bearing and raising children, Maya women participated in economic, governmental and farming activities. The lives of women in ancient [[Mesoamerica]] are not well documented: "of the three elite founding area tombs discovered to date within the [[Copán|Copan Acropolis]], two contain the remains of women, and yet there is not a single reference to a woman in either known contemporary texts or later retrospective accounts of Early Classic events and personages at Copan," writes a scholar.&lt;ref name="bell2002"&gt;Bell, E. E. “Engendering a Dynasty: A Royal Woman in the Margarita Tomb, Copan,” In ''Ancient Maya Women'', ed. Traci Ardren. Walnut Creek: Altmira Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Women play a significant role in rituals, cooking food for consumption and sacrifice. Whether women participated in said rituals is unknown. Women also worked on all of the [[Maya textiles|textiles]], an essential resource and product for Maya society.

The status of women in Maya society can be inferred from their burials and textual and monumental history. Maya societies include [[Toniná]], a city which developed a  [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] system of hereditary descent after the reign and death of the powerful leader, [[Lady Kʼawil]]. She had assumed the mantle of power after the failure of the two male leaders.&lt;ref name="ayalafalcon2002"&gt;Ayala Falcon, M. “Lady Kʼawil, Goddess O, and Maya Warfare," In ''Ancient Maya Women'', ed. Traci Ardren. Walnut Creek: Altamira Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Kʼawil's reign is documented in murals that depict her seated on a [[throne]] with captives at her feet.

==Food==
[[Maya cuisine]] has been well documented. Techniques implemented by [[pre-Columbian]] Mayan societies include large-scale agricultural production, hunting, and foraging. The [[milpa]] growing system provided the essential staples of the Mayan diet: corn, beans, and squash. They also have a small variety of rice called [[quinoa]].

==Art==
The leading role of [[Maya moon goddess|the Moon goddess]] may be interpreted through her depiction in the [[Codex|codices]] and in ancient murals. Another often depicted goddess is [[Ixchel]]. [[Textile]]s were a central aspect of ancient Mayan life, and while it is not known whether all women produced textiles, those that were produced were created by women. Women used different objects in the spinning and weaving processes depending on their [[social class]]. [[Nobility|Noble women]] could use [[dye]] in textiles. Craft and fiber evidence from the city of Ceren, which was buried by [[volcanic ash]] in 600 C.E., indicates that by that time, women's textile work was considered art, not simply crafts woven for a specific household purpose. The creation of the works of art suggests there was a market for them. Women held power in their ability to work thread and to create something that represented value.

==Women's role in ritual==
The social, economic, and political rank of ancient Maya women is increasingly debated in [[archaeology|archeological]] studies into the role of gender. To date, lines of evidence are based chiefly on investigation of [[material culture]] (e.g. monumental sculpture and iconography, ceramic art), use of space (residential architecture and activity analysis and, to a lesser extent, mortuary data). The principle of [[Interpersonal compatibility#Complementarity|complementarity]], i.e. that men and women played separate, but equally important, roles in society, is found in many studies that define an ideological basis for various expressions of female power, including male/female pairings and gender combination. For example, in the [[iconography]] of the Classic period public monuments which represent elites it could be argued that although women are seen as parts of male history in the texts of monuments depicting the lives of rulers, the images on the same monuments do not dwell on sexual characteristics. Males and females are identifiable only by their clothing and decoration, which shows a 'unified elite identity', in which male/female pairs are dichotomous. [[Grave goods]], inscriptions, and texts also provide evidence of complementarity via the authority elite women gave to ruling lineages often through marriage alliance outside their natal homelands.

Food in the culture also serves as a determinant of status and as metaphor. The processes of producing, distributing, and consuming food, as in all cultures, reflect their prevailing norms. In this instance, it can be inferred as a source of power for ancient Maya women. Although it is believed that elite women controlled food used in rituals, analysis of diet from a variety of sites at different time periods indicate that women ate less valued food than their male counterparts. By contrast, non-elite women appear to have shared the same food with men. This finding may suggest that: women did not participate in ritual consumption of food in the same way or to the same extent that men did; or that food consumption was associated with gender identity. Preferential access to ritual food by males ceases after the Spanish conquest but males continued to have more carnivorous diets. This phenomenon could be caused by the conversion of public rituals to private or the assimilation of Spanish gender values, or underlying ideology that is maintained in gender dietary differences.
Virtually all rituals involved feasting and women were in charge of the preparation of food and drink used as offering and for consumption, as well as providing offering of cloth (see below). Feast and rituals were visible and significant means used by competing Maya elites to demonstrate their status. Whether or not women were active participants does not belie the social, symbolic and political meaning of their contribution &lt;ref&gt;Robin, C.  “Gender, farming, and long-term change: Maya Historical and Archaeological perspectives,”  In ''Current Anthropology'', Wenner-Gren, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the ideological basis for high female's status, women exercised agency through their labor during the historic period. The labor of women was very important, both socially and economically but their participation in public ritual was limited; because of the potential ethnocentric and geographic bias. There may have been temporal and/or regional differences in the degree of female participation in ritual.&lt;ref&gt;White, C.  “Gendered Food Behavior among the Maya,”  In the ''Journal of Social Archaeology'', Sage Journals, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender roles==
Men and women performed differing tasks: "males produce[d] food by agricultural labor, and helped women make babies but females process[ed] the products of [[Field (agriculture)|the field]] to make them edible."&lt;ref name="josserand2002"&gt;Josserand, J. K. ''Women in Classic Maya Hieroglyphic Texts.” Walnut Creek: Altamira Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In addition to raising deer when necessary, women had religious responsibilities related to household rituals. Women held important daily roles in this aspect of life. While young boys were being taught hunting skills, "the girl was trained in the household, and she was taught how to keep the domestic religious [[shrine]]s."&lt;ref name="sigal2000"&gt;Sigal, P. ''From Moon Goddesses to Virgins: The Colonization of Yucatecan Maya Sexual Desire.'' Austin: University of Texas Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were associated with the ritual practice of [[maya religion|religion]], as well as the beliefs themselves. The Moon Goddess is one of the most [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|prominent gods]] in [[Pantheon (gods)|the Maya pantheon]]. Through her relations with the other gods, she produced the Maya population. [[maya rulers|The local rulers]] claimed descent from the Moon Goddess.

[[Gender]] in ancient Maya art is ambiguous.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}. In some images of [[Heir apparent|heir]] recognition, this duality is explicit: there is a male figure on one side of the newly anointed, and a [[queen mother|female figure]] on the other side.

==Textiles==
The prevalence of females in rituals reflects the importance of women to Maya social structure during the Classic period (AD 250– AD 900). Women were the primary weavers of textiles, which formed a major part of any ancient Mesoamerican economy. Based on ethnohistory and iconography, the Maya were huge producers of material for both internal and external use. However, the archaeological classification of textile production is complicated in any tropical region because of issues of conservation.

===Evidence for textile production at Caracol, Belize=== 
The evidence for the production and distribution of cloth that is found in the pre-Columbian Maya area and a large contributing site of archaeological data relative to textiles from the ancient Maya is in the city of [[Caracol]], Belize. Archaeology at Caracol has been carried out annually from 1985 to the present and has resulted in the collection of data that permits insight into the economic production and social distribution of cloth at the site. This is accomplished through examining the contexts and distributions of spindle whorls, bone needles, bone pins and hairpins, bone awls, and limestone bars. All of these artifacts can be related to weaving, netting, or cloth in some way.

[[Spindle whorl]]s are the artifacts most clearly associated with textile production. At least 57 have been recovered at Caracol, 38 of them in 20 different burials. Several of these interments are of high-status women placed in the most important architectural constructions at the site. The contextual placement of these burials stresses not only the link between women and weaving, but also the high status associated with such an activity, thus signaling the importance of cloth and spinning in ancient Maya society.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, A. and Chase, D.  “Textiles and the Maya Archaeological Record,”  In ''Ancient Mesoamerica'', Cambridge University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child bearing==
Bearing and rearing children was an integral part of society. The [[mythology]] and power associated with the ability to create life was one which men tried to emulate. Men participated in [[bloodletting]] their own genitals to create something new from their [[blood]].&lt;ref name="gustafson2002"&gt;Gustafson, L. S.  “Mother/Father Kings,” In ''Ancient Maya Gender Identity and Relations'', ed. Lowell S. Gustafson and Amelia M. Trevelyan. Westport: Bergin &amp; Garvey, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of giving birth to life, they would give birth to new eras through the symbolic gesture of [[menstruation]]. This act was highly ritualized; the objects used to pierce the skin were "[[stingray]] spines, [[obsidian]] blades, or other sharp instruments."&lt;ref name="gustafson2002" /&gt; The blood was allowed to drip on cloth, which was burned as part of the ritual.

A medical study found out that Mexican Mayan women have the lowest symptoms of menopause reported along with Greek peasant women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=591|edition=illustrated|pages=|year=2011|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=Elsevier Australia|author1=Vicki Kotsirilos|author2=Luis Vitetta|author3=Avni Sali|volume=|quote=|location=|title=A Guide to Evidence-based Integrative and Complementary Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISZY-PQv_ggC&amp;pg=PA591&amp;dq=chinese+mayan+women&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Bw6aVfjWO8qZyATm9qqoCw&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20mayan%20women&amp;f=false|archivedate=|isbn=0729539083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A medical study found that Mayan girls entered into menarche at around 15.1 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=45|edition=2, illustrated, revised|pages=|year=1995|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=CRC Press|author=Theresa Overfield|editor=|others=|volume=|quote=|location=|title=Biological Variation in Health and Illness: Race, Age, and Sex Differencesl|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CT1GgunY_-IC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=mayan+girls&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kOeiVeCzDoLk-AGhw4CgBA&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=mayan%20girls&amp;f=false|archivedate=|isbn=0849345774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intermarriage==
In East Central [[Quintana Roo]] some of the Mayans are descended from the inter-marriage between Mayan women and Chinese migrants which exposed them to discrimination by some native people, although they are accepted in general, according to Alfonso Villa R.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=96|pages=|year=1945|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=|volume=|author=ALFONSO VILLA R.|others=|edition=|quote=|location=|title=THE MAYA OF EAST CENTRAL QUINTANA ROO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yep9P54bn5gC&amp;q=chinese+married+mayan+women+indian&amp;dq=chinese+married+mayan+women+indian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jTafVZjRPIzv-AHkq6OIBQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg|archivedate=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=96|pages=|year=1945|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=|volume=|author=ALFONSO VILLA R.|others=|edition=|quote=|location=|title=THE MAYA OF EAST CENTRAL QUINTANA ROO|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yep9P54bn5gC&amp;q=chinese+marry+mayan+indian+women&amp;dq=chinese+marry+mayan+indian+women&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3z6fVannFMWs-AHinLagBQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg|archivedate=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mestizos and Mayans married Chinese without restraint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=275|edition=|pages=|year=1932|accessdate=May 17, 2014|publisher=Westinghouse Club|others=Electric Club, Westinghouse Club|volume=|quote=|location=|title=The Electric Journal, Volume 29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuHmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=mayan+girls+chinese&amp;dq=mayan+girls+chinese&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hOehVZnBOIeNNty5gfgM&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwADge|archivedate=|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
