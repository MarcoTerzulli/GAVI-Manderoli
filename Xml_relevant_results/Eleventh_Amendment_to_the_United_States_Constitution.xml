The '''Eleventh Amendment''' ('''Amendment XI''') to the [[United States Constitution]] was passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]] on March 4, 1794, and ratified by the [[U.S. state|states]] on February 7, 1795. The Eleventh Amendment restricts the ability of individuals to bring suit against states in federal court.

The Eleventh Amendment was adopted to overrule the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court's]] decision in ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'' (1793). In that case, the Supreme Court had held that states did not enjoy [[Sovereign immunity#State sovereign immunity|sovereign immunity]] from suits made by citizens of other states in federal court. Thus, the Eleventh Amendment established that federal courts do not have the authority to hear cases brought by private citizens against states. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has held that Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity when using its authority under the Bankruptcy Clause or Section 5 of the [[Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. The Supreme Court has also held that federal courts can [[Injunction|enjoin]] state officials from violating federal law.

==Text==
{{quote|The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.}}

==Background==
{{see also|Sovereign immunity in the United States#State sovereign immunity in federal courts|l1=State sovereign immunity}}
The Eleventh Amendment was the first Constitutional amendment adopted after the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. The amendment was adopted following the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Chisholm v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|2|419|1793}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment11/annotation01.html#1|title=Annotation 1 - Eleventh Amendment - State Immunity|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=May 4, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625034659/http://constitution.findlaw.com/amendment11/annotation01.html#1|archivedate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Chisholm'', the Court ruled that federal courts had the authority to hear cases in law and [[Equity (law)|equity]] brought by private citizens against states and that states did not enjoy [[sovereign immunity]] from suits made by citizens of other states in federal court. Thus, the amendment clarified [[Article Three of the United States Constitution#Section 2|Article III, Section 2]] of the Constitution, which gives [[diversity jurisdiction]] to the judiciary to hear cases "between a state and citizens of another state".&lt;ref&gt;Susan Gluck Mezey, 2006.

==Proposal and ratification==
The Eleventh Amendment was proposed by the [[3rd United States Congress|3rd Congress]] on March 4, 1794, when it was approved by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by vote of 81–9,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4 Annals of Congress 477 (1795)|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&amp;fileName=004/llac004.db&amp;recNum=236|accessdate=April 18, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020191739/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&amp;fileName=004%2Fllac004.db&amp;recNum=236|archivedate=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been previously passed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]], 23–2, on January 14, 1794.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4 Annals of Congress 30 (1795)|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&amp;fileName=004/llac004.db&amp;recNum=12|accessdate=April 18, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206063352/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&amp;fileName=004%2Fllac004.db&amp;recNum=12|archivedate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment was [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Ratification of amendments|ratified]] by the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] of the following states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation, Centennial Edition, Interim Edition: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 26, 2013|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CONAN-2013/pdf/GPO-CONAN-2013.pdf|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|accessdate=April 13, 2014|location=Washington, DC|page=42|year=2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225114303/http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-CONAN-2013/pdf/GPO-CONAN-2013.pdf|archivedate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[South Carolina]] – December 4, 1797

On January 8, 1798, approximately three years after the Eleventh Amendment's adoption, President [[John Adams]] stated in a message to Congress that the Eleventh Amendment had been ratified by the necessary number of States and that it was now a part of the Constitution of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=7 Annals of Congress 809 (1798)|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&amp;fileName=007/llac007.db&amp;recNum=400|accessdate=April 18, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206063352/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&amp;fileName=007%2Fllac007.db&amp;recNum=400|archivedate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]] did not take action on the amendment during that era; neither did [[Tennessee]], which had become a State on June 16, 1796. However, on June 25, 2018, the [[New Jersey Senate]] adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 75 to symbolically post-ratify the Eleventh Amendment.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

==Impact==
[[Image:11th Amendment Pg1of1 AC.jpg|190px|thumb|The Eleventh Amendment in the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]]]]
=== Retroactivity ===
In ''[[Hollingsworth v. Virginia]]'', {{ussc|3|378|1798}}, the Supreme Court held that every pending action brought under ''Chisholm'' had to be dismissed because of the amendment's adoption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=3&amp;invol=378 Opinion of the Court in ''Hollingsworth v. Virginia''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024224920/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=3&amp;invol=378 |date=2012-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sovereign immunity===
The amendment's text does not mention suits brought against a state by its own citizens. However, in ''[[Hans v. Louisiana]]'', {{ussc|134|1|1890}}, the Supreme Court ruled that the amendment reflects a broader principle of sovereign immunity. As [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Anthony Kennedy]] later stated in ''[[Alden v. Maine]]'', {{ussc|527|706|1999}}:

{{quote|[S]overeign immunity derives not from the Eleventh Amendment but from the structure of the original Constitution itself. ... Nor can we conclude that the specific Article I powers delegated to Congress necessarily include, by virtue of the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] or otherwise, the incidental authority to subject the States to private suits as a means of achieving objectives otherwise within the scope of the enumerated powers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-436.ZO.html Opinion of the Court in ''Alden v. Maine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126100428/http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-436.ZO.html|date=2009-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, Justice [[David Souter]], writing for a four-Justice dissent in ''Alden'', said the states surrendered their sovereign immunity when they ratified the Constitution. He read the amendment's text as reflecting a narrow form of sovereign immunity that limited only the diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts. He concluded that neither the Eleventh Amendment in particular nor the Constitution in general insulates the states from suits by individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-436.ZD.html Dissenting opinion in ''Alden v. Maine''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714072241/http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/98-436.ZD.html|date=2007-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eleventh Amendment immunity also protects states from lawsuits by foreign states in federal courts.&lt;ref&gt;''Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi'', {{ussc|292|313|1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application to federal law ===
Although the Eleventh Amendment grants immunity to states from suit for money damages or equitable relief without their consent, in ''[[Ex parte Young]]'', {{ussc|209|123|1908}}, the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts may [[Injunction|enjoin]] state officials from violating federal law. In ''[[Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer]]'', {{ussc|427|445|1976}}, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress may [[Abrogation doctrine|abrogate]] state immunity from suit under [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Power of enforcement|Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment]]. In ''[[Central Virginia Community College v. Katz]]'', {{ussc|546|356|2006}}, the Court ruled [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8, Clause 4]] of the Constitution abrogated state immunity in [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] cases. In ''[[Lapides v. Board of Regents of University System of Georgia]]'', {{ussc|535|613|2002}}, the Supreme Court ruled that when a state invokes a [[United States federal courts|federal court's]] [[removal jurisdiction]], it [[Waiver|waives]] the Eleventh Amendment in the removed case.

=== Territorial application ===
The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit]] has ruled that [[Puerto Rico]] enjoys Eleventh Amendment immunity.&lt;ref&gt;e.g., [http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/715/694/404809/ ''Ramirez v. Puerto Rico Fire Service and Office of Personnel'' (1st Cir. 1983)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105164317/http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/715/694/404809/|date=2012-01-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The territories of [[American Samoa]], [[Guam]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]]  and the [[United States Virgin Islands|Virgin Islands]] do not enjoy Eleventh Amendment immunity.&lt;ref&gt;Guam Soc. of Obstetricians and Gynecologists v. Ada, 776 F.Supp. 1422 (D.Guam 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norita v. Northern Mariana Islands, 331 F.3d 690 (9th Cir 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tonder v. M/V The Burkholder, 630 F.Supp. 691 (D.Virgin Islands 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
