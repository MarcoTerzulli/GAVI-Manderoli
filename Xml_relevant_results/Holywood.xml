'''Holywood''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|l|i|w|ʊ|d}} {{respell|HOL|ee-wuud}}) is a town in the metropolitan area of [[Belfast]] in [[County Down]], [[Northern Ireland]]. It is a [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] and [[townland]] of 755 acres lying on the shore of [[Belfast Lough]], between Belfast and [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]]. [[Holywood Exchange]] and [[Belfast City Airport]] are nearby. The town hosts an annual [[jazz]] and [[blues]] festival.

==Toponymy==
The English name ''Holywood'' comes {{etymology|la|Sanctus Boscus|holy wood}}. This was the name the [[Normans]] gave to the woodland surrounding the [[monastery]] of St Laiseran, son of Nasca. The monastery was founded by Laiseran before 640 and was on the site of the present [[Holywood Priory]]. The earliest [[Anglicised]] form appears as ''Haliwode'' in a 14th-century document. Today, the name is pronounced ''Hollywood''.

The [[Irish language|Irish]] name for Holywood is ''Ard Mhic Nasca'' meaning "high ground of Mac Nasca".&lt;ref name="PDI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/66065.aspx|title=Ard Mhic Nasca/Holywood|website=Logainm.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{cite web|title=Ulster Place Names, County Down|url=http://www.ulsterplacenames.org/ainm_index_down.htm|work=Ainm:Journal of the Ulster Place-name Society (1987, 1988)|accessdate=22 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214225130/http://www.ulsterplacenames.org/ainm_index_down.htm|archive-date=14 December 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 17th century, [[Ulster]] ports began to rise in prominence. In 1625, William Pitt was appointed as Customer of the ports of [[Newcastle, County Down|Newcastle]], [[Dundrum, County Down|Dundrum]], [[Killough]], [[Portaferry]], [[Donaghadee]], [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] and Holywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=O'Sullivan, Aidan  |author2=Breen, Colin|year=2007|title=Maritime Ireland. An Archaeology of Coastal Communities|publisher=Tempus|location=Stroud|page=211|isbn=978-0-7524-2509-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, Holywood, like many other coastal villages throughout Ireland, became popular as a [[Seaside resort|resort]] for [[bathing|sea-bathing]]. Many wealthy [[Belfast]] merchants chose the town and the surrounding area to build large homes for themselves. These included the Kennedys of [[Cultra]] and the Harrisons of Holywood. Dalchoolin House stood on the site of the present [[Ulster Transport Museum]], while Cultra Manor was built between 1902–04 and now houses part of the [[Ulster Folk and Transport Museum]].

The railway line from Belfast to Holywood opened in 1848, and this led to rapid development. The population of Holywood was approximately 3,500 in 1900 and had grown to 12,000 by 2001. This growth, coupled with that of other towns and villages along the coastal strip to [[Bangor, Northern Ireland|Bangor]], necessitated the construction of the Holywood Bypass in the early 1970s. Holywood today is a popular [[residential area]] and is well known for its fashionable shops, boutiques, arts and crafts.
[[File:The Priory, Holywood - geograph.org.uk - 344064.jpg|thumb|Holywood Priory]]

The Old Priory ruins lie at the bottom of the High Street. The tower dates from 1800, but the oldest ruins date from the early 13th century. The Priory graveyard is the resting place for many distinguished [[citizens]] including the educational reformer, Dr Robert Sullivan, and the Praeger family. [[Robert Lloyd Praeger]] (1865–1953) was an internationally renowned [[botanist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Praeger|first=Robert Lloyd|year=1969|title=The Way that I Went: An Irishman in Ireland|pages=10–12|location=Dublin|publisher= Allen Figgis|isbn= 0-900372-93-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his sister, [[Rosamond Praeger]] (1867–1954), gained fame as a [[sculpture|sculptor]] and writer. "Johnny the Jig", one of her sculptures, is situated in the town. Praeger House at [[Sullivan Upper School|Sullivan Upper Grammar School]] is named after the family. Bishop [[Robert Bent Knox]] is also buried there.

On 17 June 1994, Garnet Bell, a former pupil bearing a grudge, entered an assembly hall at [[Sullivan Upper School]] and used a flamethrower to attack students taking [[GCE Advanced Level|A-level]] examinations. Six pupils were injured; three of them seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flame-thrower case man 'did not mean to hurt pupils'|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=20 June 1995|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/flamethrower-case-man-did-not-mean-to-hurt-pupils-1587302.html|accessdate=1 August 2009|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 April 2010, at around 12:24am, a car bombing occurred near [[Palace Barracks]], a [[British Army]] barracks on the edge of Holywood's town centre. An elderly man was blown off his feet and had to be treated in hospital. The bomb was allegedly driven towards the base in a hijacked taxi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article7095068.ece|work=The Times|location=London, UK|title=Car bomb explodes near MI5 base in Belfast|first=David|last=Sharrock|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Real IRA]] claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8614723.stm|work=BBC News|title=Real IRA admits NI MI5 base bomb|date=12 April 2010|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Places of interest==
[[File:HolywoodNeds.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Maypole and Ned's Bar]]
*Holywood is famous for its [[maypole]] at the crossroads in the centre of town. Its origin is uncertain, but, according to local folklore, it dates from 1700, when a Dutch ship is said to have run aground on the [[shore]] nearby, and the crew erected the broken [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] to show their appreciation of the assistance offered to them by the townsfolk. The maypole is still used for dancing at the annual May Day fair.
*Nearly as famous, is the adjacent Maypole Bar,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.music-finder.co.uk/hisrul.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624232147/http://www.music-finder.co.uk/hisrul.htm|url-status=dead|title=Maypole Bar|archivedate=24 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; locally known as Ned's or Carty's. It was first licensed in 1857, and, from then until 2018, it has had only 3 proprietors. [[County Donegal]] native, Ned Carty, bought it from Mick O'Kane in the late 1960s. It had been owned by O'Kane since 1908. It is now run by Ned's son, Brian Carty.
*There is a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] motte in the town which may have been constructed on an earlier burial mound.
*The [[Ulster Folk and Transport Museum]] illustrating the way of life and traditions of the people of [[Ulster]] is nearby, at [[Cultra]].

The first section of the [[Belfast and County Down Railway]] (BCDR) line from [[Belfast]] to Holywood, along with [[Holywood railway station]], opened on 2 August 1848. The line was extended to [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]] by the Belfast, Holywood and Bangor Railway (BHBR), opening on 1 May 1865, and acquired by the BCDR in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belfast and County Down Railway|work=Irish Railwayana|url=http://www.irishrailwayana.com/pa005.htm|accessdate=1 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holywood station was closed for goods traffic on 24 April 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holywood station|work=Railscot – Irish Railways|url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf|accessdate=28 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==

===Cricket===
[[Holywood Cricket Club]] is amalgamated with the Holywood R.F.C. Cricket may have been played in Holywood as early as 1860 but the present club, as we know it, was formed as a result of a meeting held on Monday, 28 March 1881. In the first season games against Ballynahinch, Enfield, Lurgan, North Down and Sydenham followed the opening game against Wellington, when the team was captained by Joe Ross. The club's first home was at Kinnegar where the club President and Benefactor for many years gave use of part of his land to the club free of charge. The members worked hard to turn the area into a cricket ground and by 1883 had secured sufficient money to erect a new pavilion.

North Down Borough Council has provided HCC with a new home at Seapark. "Seapark Oval" was finally ready during the 2005 season, after 8 years of using the pitch at Sullivan School. The club had been forced off the Belfast Road grounds it occupied for 100+ years due to the GAA upgrading the pitch it leases from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Connor and Down, which meant that with the playing surfaces of the two sports pitches being at different levels, cricket could no longer be played at this venue unless the ground was raised to the same level as the GAA pitch. The cricket club now share the Seapark grounds with a bowling club and [[Holywood F.C.|Holywood Football Club]], the latter hoping to secure new grounds at Spafield in the near future. There are also plans for a new club house at the Seapark grounds.

===Football===
[[Holywood F.C.]] was formed in 1983 following the amalgamation of two Northern Amateur League teams, Loughview Star (1961–83) and Holywood Town (1972–83). These two clubs had not been very successful, though Loughview had caused a sensation when they reached the Clarence Cup final while still a Second Division club, losing 2–0 to Lisburn Rangers in 1964–65. Loughview won Division 2B in 1981–82 and after the amalgamation, the new club finished runners up in 2b in 1992–93, but were soon relegated again. The club's biggest day came when they won the [[IFA Junior Cup]] final in 1989–90, beating their town rivals Holywood Rec. in the decider. The club has enjoyed success in recent years, by winning the 2a title and the Cochrane &amp; Corry Cup in the 1999–2000 season. As a result, the club were promoted for the first time in their history to [[Northern Ireland football league system|intermediate]] status in Division 1B.

===GAA===
The first [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] club in Holywood was organised in 1927. It was called St Colmcille's. The team's strip was made up of black shorts and black shirts with white collars. This early club team also sponsored a handball team and a drama club. Although successful in the early days, the club lasted only ten years. It was revived in 1948 under the title of Holywood's Patron Saint, St. Laiseran, by John Regan, Davy McCoy and Paddy McNally, and lasted until it withdrew from the League in 1956.

The successful Thomas Russell Gaelic Club was formed in 1962 and soon earned the name "the Holywood Giant Killers". It played on a notoriously uneven pitch in the 'Convent Fields'. But early success did not continue – the club struggled on until 1976 when it withdrew from the Antrim League. St. Paul's Gaelic Football Club was founded in 1979 as an amalgamation of the Holywood, Bangor, and Newtownards clubs. It operated under a deal with [[Holywood Cricket Club]] which maintained the Gaelic pitch in return for using a small section of the lower pitch as part of its 'out-field'.

===Golf===
Holywood Golf Club, founded in 1904 is where 2011 US Open, 2012 US PGA, The Open 2014, and 2014 US PGA champion [[Rory McIlroy]] learned his golf, and the champion still calls it his home course. Nearby [[Craigavad]] is the home of the [[Royal Belfast Golf Club]], the oldest in Ireland, dating from 1881. The club's present course was designed by architect Harry Colt in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://royalbelfast.com/|title=Royal Belfast Golf Club – RBGC The Oldest Golf Club in Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
