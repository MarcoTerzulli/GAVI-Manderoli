{{main|Subprime mortgage crisis}}

[[Credit rating agency|Credit rating agencies]] (CRAs)—firms which rate debt [[Financial instrument|instruments]]/[[Security (finance)|securities]] according to the debtor's ability to pay lenders back—played a significant role at various stages in the American [[subprime mortgage crisis]] of 2007–2008 that led to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|great recession of 2008–2009]].
The new, complex securities of "[[structured finance]]" used to finance subprime mortgages could not have been sold without ratings by the "Big Three" rating agencies—[[Moody's Investors Service]], [[Standard &amp; Poor's#Credit ratings|Standard &amp; Poor's]], and [[Fitch Group|Fitch Ratings]]. A large section of the debt securities market—many [[money market fund|money market]]s and [[pension fund]]s—were restricted in their bylaws to holding only the safest securities—i.e. securities the rating agencies designated "triple-A".&lt;ref name="McLean p.111"/&gt; The pools of debt the agencies gave their highest ratings to &lt;ref&gt;(the raw material of the debt securities)&lt;/ref&gt; included over three trillion dollars of loans to homebuyers with bad credit and undocumented incomes through 2007.&lt;ref name="scourge-top"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Elliot Blair|title=Bringing Down Wall Street as Ratings Let Loose Subprime Scourge|journal=Bloomberg|date=September 24, 2008|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ah839IWTLP9s|quote=Driven by competition for fees and market share, the New York-based companies stamped out top ratings on debt pools that included $3.2 trillion of loans to homebuyers with bad credit and undocumented incomes between 2002 and 2007.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of these triple-A securities were downgraded to "junk" status by 2010,&lt;ref name="McLean p.111"&gt;McLean, Bethany and Joe Nocera. ''All the Devils Are Here, the Hidden History of the Financial Crisis'', Portfolio, Penguin, 2010 (p.111)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;$300 billion [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs) issued in 2005–2007 (over half of the CDOs by value during that time period) that rating agencies gave their highest "triple-A" rating to, were written down to "junk" by the end of 2009. (source:{{cite book|title=The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report |year=2011 |publisher=National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States |pages=228–9 |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=meltdown&gt;{{cite web|last=Barnett-Hart|first=Anna Katherine|title=The Story of the CDO Market Meltdown: An Empirical Analysis|url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/students/dunlop/2009-CDOmeltdown.pdf|work=March 19, 2009|quote=Overall, my findings suggest that the problems in the CDO market were caused by a combination of poorly constructed CDOs, irresponsible underwriting practices, and flawed credit rating procedures.|publisher=Harvard Kennedy School|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the writedowns and losses came to over half a trillion dollars.&lt;ref name=loose/&gt;&lt;ref name="scourge-gold"/&gt;
This led "to the collapse or disappearance" in 2008–09 of three major investment banks ([[Bear Stearns]], [[Lehman Brothers]], and [[Merrill Lynch]]), and the federal governments [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|buying of $700 billion of bad debt]] from distressed financial institutions.&lt;ref name="scourge-gold"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Elliot Blair|title=Bringing Down Wall Street as Ratings Let Loose Subprime Scourge|journal=Bloomberg|date=September 24, 2008|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ah839IWTLP9s|quote=Without those AAA ratings, the gold standard for debt, banks, insurance companies and pension funds wouldn't have bought the products.

==Impact on the crisis==

[[File:Impaired Securities.GIF|thumb|450px|source: [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf Final Report of the National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States], p.229, figure 11.4]]
Credit rating agencies came under scrutiny following the mortgage crisis for giving investment-grade, "money safe" ratings to [[securitization|securitized mortgages]] (in the form of securities known as [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS) and [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDO)) based on "non-prime"—subprime or Alt-A—mortgages loans.

Demand for the securities was stimulated by the large global pool of fixed income investments which had doubled from $36 trillion in 2000 to $70 trillion by 2006—more than annual global spending—and the low interest rates from competing fixed income securities, made possible by the low interest rate policy of the U.S. [[Federal Reserve Bank]] for much of that period.&lt;ref name=Giant&gt;{{cite web|title=Giant Pool of Money (transcript)|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/transcript|work=Originally aired 05.09.2008|publisher=This American Life (radio program) from WBEZ|accessdate=3 September 2013|quote=Adam Davidson: And by the way, before you finance enthusiasts start writing any letters, we do know that $70 trillion technically refers to that subset of global savings called fixed income securities. ...  Ceyla Pazarbasioglu: This number doubled since 2000. In 2000 this was about $36 trillion. Adam Davidson: So it took several hundred years for the world to get to $36 trillion. And then it took six years to get another $36 trillion}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These high ratings encouraged the flow of global investor funds into these securities funding the housing bubble in the US.&lt;ref name=Giant/&gt;

===Mortgage-related securities===
Ratings were/are vital to "private-label" [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]]—such as subprime mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and collateralized debt obligations (CDO), "[[CDO-Squared|CDOs squared]]", and "[[synthetic CDO]]s"—whose "financial engineering" make them "harder to understand and to price than individual loans".&lt;ref name="big 3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report|year=2011|publisher=National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States|pages=43–44|quote=Purchasers of the safer tranches got a higher rate of return than ultra-safe Treasury notes without much extra risk—at least in theory. However, the financial engineering behind these investments made them harder to understand and to price than individual loans. To determine likely returns, investors had to calculate the statistical probabilities that certain kinds of mortgages might default, and to estimate the revenues that would be lost because of those defaults. Then investors had to determine the effect of the losses on the payments to different tranches. This complexity transformed the three leading credit rating agencies—Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), and Fitch—into key players in the process, positioned between the issuers and the investors of securities.|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier traditional and more simple "prime" mortgage securities were issued and guaranteed by [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]]—[[Government-sponsored enterprise|"enterprises"]] sponsored by the Federal government. Their safety wasn't questioned by conservative money managers. Non-prime private label mortgage securities were neither made up of loans to borrowers with high credit ratings nor insured by a government enterprise, so issuers used an innovation in securities structure to get higher agency ratings. They pooled debt and then "sliced" the result into "[[tranche]]s", each with a different priority in the debt repayment stream of income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://upstart.bizjournals.com/multimedia/interactives/2007/12/cdo.html Here's how a CDO works]| Upstart Business Journal| December 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The most "senior" tranches highest up in priority of revenue—which usually made up most of the pool of debt—received the triple A ratings. This made them eligible for purchase by the pension funds and money market funds restricted to top-rated debt,&lt;ref name="FCIR-119"&gt;{{cite book|title=Financial Crisis Inquiry Report|year=2011|publisher=GPO|page=119|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf|quote=Credit ratings also determined whether investors could buy certain investments at all. The SEC restricts money market funds to purchasing “securities that have received credit ratings from any two NRSROs ... in one of the two highest short-term rating categories or comparable unrated securities.” The Department of Labor restricts pension fund investments to securities rated A or higher. Credit ratings affect even private transactions: contracts may contain triggers that require the posting of collateral or immediate repayment, should a security or entity be downgraded. Triggers played an important role in the financial crisis and helped cripple AIG.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for use by banks wanting to reduce costly capital requirements under [[Basel II]].&lt;ref name="McLean p.111"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"under Basel II, a AAA rated securitization requires capital allocation of only 0.6%, a BBB requires 4.8%, a BB requires 34%, whilst a BB(-) securitization requires a 52% allocation"&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity of analyzing the debt pool mortgages and tranche priority, and the position of the Big Three credit rating agencies "between the issuers and the investors of securities", is what "transformed" the agencies into "key" players in the process, according to the ''Financial Crisis Inquiry Report''.&lt;ref name="big 3"/&gt;
"Participants in the securitization industry realized that they needed to secure favorable credit ratings in order to sell structured products to investors. Investment banks therefore paid handsome fees to the rating agencies to obtain the desired ratings."&lt;ref name="Callahan"/&gt;

According to the CEO of a servicer of the securitization industry, Jim Callahan of PentAlpha, "The rating agencies were important tools to do that because you know the people that we were selling these bonds to had never really had any history in the mortgage business. ... They were looking for an independent party to develop an opinion,"&lt;ref name="Callahan"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report|year=2011|publisher=National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States|page=44|quote=Participants in the securitization industry realized that they needed to secure favorable credit ratings in order to sell structured products to investors.

"The rating agencies were important tools to do that because you know the people that we were selling these bonds to had never really had any history in the mortgage business. ... They were looking for an independent party to develop an opinion," Jim Callahan told the FCIC; Callahan is CEO of PentAlpha, which services the securitization industry, and years ago he worked on some of the earliest securitizations|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 to 2007, Moody's rated nearly 45,000 mortgage-related securities&lt;ref name=nber/&gt;—more than half of those it rated—as triple-A. In contrast only six (private sector) companies in the United States were given that top rating.&lt;ref name="FCIR45000"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report|year=2011|publisher=National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States|page=xxv|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 2008, there were over $11 trillion structured finance securities outstanding in the US bond market debt.&lt;ref name=nber&gt;{{cite web|last=Benmelech|first=Efraim|title=The Credit Rating Crisis|url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c11794.pdf|work=NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2009|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research, NBER Macroeconomics Annual|first2 = Jennifer | last2 = Dlugosz|volume=24|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CDOs====
Rating agencies were even more important in disposing of the MBS tranches that could not be rated triple A. Although these made up a minority of the value of the MBS tranches, unless buyers were found for them, it would not be profitable to make the security in the first place. And because traditional mortgage investors were risk-averse (often because of [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] regulations or restrictions in their charters), these less-safe tranches were the most difficult to sell.&lt;ref name="reckless-278"&gt;Morgenson and Rosner ''Reckless Endangerment'', 2010 p.278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also ''Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

To sell these "mezzanine" tranches, investment bankers pooled them to form another security—known as a collateralized debt obligation (CDO). Though the raw material of these "obligations" was made up of BBB, A−, etc. tranches, the CRAs rated 70%&lt;ref&gt;70%. "Firms bought mortgage-backed bonds with the very highest yields they could find and reassembled them into new CDOs. The original bonds ... could be lower-rated securities that once reassembled into a new CDO would wind up with as much as 70% of the tranches rated triple-A. Ratings arbitrage, Wall Street called this practice. A more accurate term would have been ratings laundering." (source: McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'', 2010 p. 122)&lt;/ref&gt; to 80%&lt;ref&gt;80%. "In a CDO you gathered a 100 different mortgage bonds—usually the riskiest lower floors of the original tower ... They bear a lower credit rating triple B. ...  if you could somehow get them rerated as triple A, thereby lowering their perceived risk, however dishonestly and artificially. This is what Goldman Sachs had cleverly done. it was absurd. The 100 buildings occupied the same floodplain; in the event of flood, the ground floors of all of them were equally exposed. But never mind: the rating agencies, who were paid fat fees by Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms for each deal they rated, pronounced 80% of the new tower of debt triple-A." (source: Michael Lewis, ''[[The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine]]'' WW Norton and Co, 2010, p. 73)&lt;/ref&gt; of the new CDO tranches triple A. The 20–30% remaining mezzanine tranches were usually bought up by other CDOs, to make so-called "[[CDO-Squared]]" securities which also produced tranches rated mostly triple A by rating agencies.&lt;ref&gt;"According to data compiled by the FCIC, tranches from CDOs rose from an average of 7% of the collateral in mortgage-backed CDOs in 2003 to 14% by 2007. CDO-Squared deals—those engineered primarily from the tranches of other CDOs—grew from 36 marketwide in 2005 to 48 in 2006 and 41 2007." ''Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; This process was disparaged as a way of transforming "dross into gold"&lt;ref name="Endangerment-280"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgenson|first=Gretchen|title=Reckless Endangerment : How Outsized ambition, Greed and Corruption Led to Economic Armageddon|year=2011|publisher=Times Books, Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/recklesendangerm00morg|url-access=registration|quote=Morgenson and Rosner ''Reckless Endangerment'', 2010.|first2=Joshua|last2=Rosner|page=[https://archive.org/details/recklesendangerm00morg/page/280 280]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "ratings laundering"&lt;ref&gt;McLean, and Nocera. ''All the Devils Are Here'',  2010 (p. 122)&lt;/ref&gt; by at least some business journalists.

Trust in rating agencies was particularly important for CDOs for another reason—their contents were subject to change, so CDO managers "didn't always have to disclose what the securities contained". This lack of transparency did not affect demand for the securities. Investors "weren't so much buying a security" as they "were buying a triple-A rating", according to business journalists [[Bethany McLean]] and [[Joe Nocera]].&lt;ref&gt;McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'', 2010 p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Still another structured product was the "synthetic CDO". Cheaper and easier to create than original "cash" CDOs, these securities did not provide funding for housing. Instead synthetic CDO-buying investors were in effect providing insurance (in the form of "[[credit default swap]]s") against mortgage default. Synthetics "referenced" cash CDOs, and rather than providing investors with interest and principal payments from MBS tranches, they paid insurance premium-like payments from credit default swap "insurance". If the referenced CDOs defaulted, investors lost their investment, which was paid out as insurance.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlike the traditional cash CDO, synthetic CDOs contained no actual tranches of mortgage-backed securities ... in the place of real mortgage assets, these CDOs contained credit default swaps and did not finance a single home purchase." (source: ''The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'', 2011, p. 142)&lt;/ref&gt; Because synthetics referenced another (cash) CDO, more than one—in fact numerous—synthetics could be made to reference the same original. This multiplied the effect if a referenced security defaulted.&lt;ref&gt;McLean, and Nocera. ''All the Devils Are Here'', 2010 (p.263)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.propublica.org/feature/all-the-magnetar-trade-how-one-hedge-fund-helped-keep-the-housing-bubble |title=The Magnetar Trade: How One Hedge Fund Helped Keep the Bubble Going (Single Page)-April 2010 |access-date=2017-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410084812/http://www.propublica.org/feature/all-the-magnetar-trade-how-one-hedge-fund-helped-keep-the-housing-bubble |archive-date=2010-04-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here again the giving of triple-A ratings to "large chunks"&lt;ref&gt;McLean and Nocera. ''All the Devils Are Here'',  2010 (p. 265)&lt;/ref&gt; of synthetics by the rating agencies was crucial to the securities' success. The buyer of synthetic tranches (who often went on to lose his investment) was seldom an analyst "who had investigated the mortgage-backed security", was aware of deteriorating [[mortgage underwriting]] standards, or that the payments they would receive were often coming from investors betting against mortgage-backed security solvency. Rather, "it was someone who was buying a rating and thought he couldn't lose money."&lt;ref&gt;McLean and Nocera. ''All the Devils Are Here'',  2010 (p. 266)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downgrades and writedowns===

By the end of 2009, over half of the collateralized debt obligations by value&lt;ref&gt;worth $300 billion&lt;/ref&gt; issued at the end of the housing bubble (from 2005–2007) that rating agencies gave their highest "triple-A" rating to, were "impaired"—that is either written-down to "junk" or suffered a "principal loss" (i.e. not only had they not paid interest but investors would not get back some of the principal they invested).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report |year=2011 |publisher=National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States |pages=228–9, figure 11.4 |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf|accessdate=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/02/business/02norris.html?ref=business | work=The New York Times | title=Being Kept in the Dark on Wall Street | first=Floyd | last=Norris | date=2 November 2007 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission estimates that by April 2010, of all mortgage-backed securities Moody's had rated triple-A in 2006, 73% were downgraded to junk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report |year=2011 |publisher=National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States |pages=122|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortgage underwriting standards deteriorated to the point that between 2002 and 2007 an estimated $3.2 trillion in loans were made to homeowners with bad credit and undocumented incomes (e.g., subprime or [[Alt-A]] mortgages)&lt;ref name=loose/&gt; and bundled into MBSs and collateralized debt obligations that received high ratings and therefore could be sold to global investors. Higher ratings were believed justified by various [[credit enhancement]]s including over-collateralization (i.e., pledging collateral in excess of debt issued), credit default insurance, and equity investors willing to bear the first losses. But as of September 2008, bank writedowns and losses on these investments totaled $523 billion.&lt;ref name=loose&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=ah839IWTLP9s Bloomberg-Smith-Bringing Down Ratings Let Loose Subprime Scourge]| By Elliot Blair Smith | bloomberg.com| September 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scourge-gold"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bottom&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=ax3vfya_Vtdo Bloomberg-Smith-Race to Bottom at Rating Agencies Secured Subprime Boom, Bust]| By Elliot Blair Smith | bloomberg.com| September 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MBS Downgrades Chart.png|thumb|350px|MBS Credit Rating Downgrades, By Quarter&lt;ref name=whitney/&gt;]]

Rating agencies lowered the credit ratings on $1.9 trillion in mortgage backed securities from the third fiscal quarter (1 July—30 September) of 2007 to the second quarter (1 April–30 June) of 2008. One institution, Merrill Lynch, sold more than $30 billion of collateralized debt obligations for 22 cents on the dollar in late July 2008.

The net worth of financial institutions owning the newly downgraded securities declined, requiring the institutions to acquire additional capital, to maintain capital ratios, which in turn often lowered the net-worth value of the institutions above and beyond the low of value of the downgraded securities.&lt;ref name=whitney&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2008/08/04/magazines/fortune/whitney_feature.fortune/index.htm The woman who called Wall Street's meltdown]| By Jon Birger| August 6, 2008| Fortune Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to the financial chain reaction were regulations—governmental or internal—requiring some institutional investors to carry only investment-grade (e.g., "BBB" and better) assets.

==Criticism==
In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2010, the rating agencies came under criticism from investigators, economists, and journalists. The [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] (FCIC)&lt;ref&gt;the ten-member commission appointed by the United States government with the goal of investigating the causes of the financial crisis of 2007–2010&lt;/ref&gt; set up by the US Congress and President to investigate the causes of the crisis, and publisher of the ''Financial Crisis Inquiry Report'' (FCIR), concluded that the "failures" of the [[Big Three (credit rating agencies)|Big Three]] rating agencies were "essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction" and "key enablers of the financial meltdown".&lt;ref name="conclusion"/&gt; It went on to say &lt;blockquote&gt;The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval. Investors relied on them, often blindly. In some cases, they were obligated to use them, or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them. This crisis could not have happened without the rating agencies. Their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades through 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms."&lt;ref name="conclusion"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf FINANCIAL CRISIS INQUIRY COMMISSION Final Report-Conclusions-January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] Commissioner Kathleen Casey complained the ratings of the large rating agencies were "catastrophically misleading", yet the agencies "enjoyed their most profitable years ever during the past decade" while doing so.&lt;ref name=casey&gt;{{cite web|last=Casey|first=Kathleen|title="In Search of Transparency, Accountability, and Competition: The Regulation of Credit Rating Agencies", remarks at "The SEC Speaks in 2009"|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2009/spch020609klc.htm|work=February 6, 2009|publisher=US SEC|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine opined that "it is beyond argument that ratings agencies did a horrendous job evaluating mortgage-tied securities before the financial crisis hit."&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite journal|last=TE|title=Free speech or knowing misrepresentation?|journal=The Economist|date=5 February 2013|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2013/02/rating-agencies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] considered "the rating agencies as one of the key culprits... They were the party that performed the alchemy that converted the securities from F-rated to A-rated. The banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the rating agencies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/aug/22/ratings-agencies-conflict-of-interest  Ratings agencies suffer 'conflict of interest', says former Moody's boss]| Rupert Neate| The Guardian| 22 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In their book on the crisis—''[[All the Devils Are Here]]''—journalists [[Bethany McLean]] and [[Joe Nocera]] criticized rating agencies for continuing "to slap their triple-A [ratings]s on subprime securities even as the underwriting deteriorated—and as the housing boom turned into an outright bubble" in 2005, 2006, 2007.&lt;ref name="McLean p.111"/&gt;

===SEC actions===

On 11 June 2008 the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] proposed far-reaching rules designed to address perceived conflicts of interest between rating agencies and issuers of structured securities. The proposal would, among other things, prohibit a credit rating agency from issuing a rating on a structured product unless information on assets underlying the product was available, prohibit credit rating agencies from structuring the same products that they rate, and require the public disclosure of the information a credit rating agency uses to determine a rating on a structured product, including information on the underlying assets. The last proposed requirement is designed to facilitate "unsolicited" ratings of structured securities by rating agencies not compensated by issuers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SEC Proposes Comprehensive Reforms to Bring Increased Transparency to Credit Rating Process | publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission | url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-110.htm | accessdate=2008-07-2008 | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 December 2008, the SEC approved measures to strengthen oversight of credit rating agencies, following a ten-month investigation that found "significant weaknesses in ratings practices," including conflicts of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-284.htm |title=SEC — Rating Agency Rules |publisher=Sec.gov |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cdo"&gt;{{Cite news

==Explanations for inaccurate ratings==
The FCIC commission found that agencies' credit ratings were influenced by "flawed computer models, the pressure from financial firms that paid for the ratings, the relentless drive for market share, the lack of resources to do the job despite record profits, and the absence of meaningful public oversight."&lt;ref name="FCIC Report-Conclusion-January 2011"&gt;[http://fcic-static.law.stanford.edu/cdn_media/fcic-reports/fcic_final_report_conclusions.pdf THE FINANCIAL CRISIS INQUIRY COMMISSION Final Report-Conclusions]&lt;/ref&gt; McLean and Nocera blame credit ratings lapses on "an erosion of standards, a willful suspension of skepticism, a hunger for big fees and market share, and an inability to stand up to" the investment banks issuing the securities.&lt;ref name="McLean p.111"/&gt;

===Competitive pressure to lower standards===

Structured investment mortgage-related securities were the rating agencies' "[[Golden Goose|golden goose]]"—in the words of one agency manager.&lt;ref name=bottom/&gt; Agencies earned as much as three times more for grading these complex products as for [[corporate bond]]s, their traditional business. On top of revenue generated for issuing credit ratings, agencies often earned $300,000–500,000 and as much as $1 million to construct a [[structured investment vehicle]].&lt;ref name="calpers"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/business/15calpers.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss | work=The New York Times | first=Leslie | last=Wayne | title=Calpers Sues Over Ratings of Securities | date=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007 the business accounted for just under half of the total ratings revenue and all of the revenue growth for [[Moody's Investors Service|Moody's]]—one of the largest agencies.&lt;ref&gt;McLean, and Nocera. ''All the Devils Are Here'', 2010 (p.124)&lt;/ref&gt; But there was always a danger of losing out on this lucrative business. Issuers played the three big credit agencies off one another, 'shopping' around to find the best ratings.

Richard Michalek, a former vice president and senior credit officer at Moody's, testified to the FCIC that even when they were not realized, "The threat of losing business to a competitor ... absolutely tilted the balance away from an independent arbiter of risk ...." When asked if the investment banks frequently threatened to withdraw their business if they didn't get their desired rating, former Moody team managing director Gary Witt told the FCIC, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Oh God, are you kidding? All the time. I mean, that's routine. I mean, they would threaten you all of the time. . . . It's like, ‘Well, next time, we're just going to go with Fitch and S&amp;P.'”&lt;ref name="FCIR-p210"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report |year=2011 |publisher=National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States |page=210 |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  At [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] rating service one subpoenaed email sent by a security-issuing banker angry over possible revision of [[residential mortgage-backed security]] ratings, told an analyst: "Heard your ratings could be 5 notches back of moddys {{sic}} equivalent, Gonna kill you resi biz. May force us to do moddyfitch [S&amp;P competitors Moody's and Fitch Rating] only ..."&lt;ref name=shopping&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nocera|title=All the Devils Are Here|url=https://archive.org/details/alldevilsarehere00mcle|url-access=registration|year=2010|publisher=Penguin|last2=McLean|quote=[Example from page 118] "UBS banker Rovert Morelli, upon hearing that S&amp;P might be revising its RMSBS ratings, sent an e-mail to an S&amp;P analyst. 'Heard your ratings could be 5 notches back of moddys [sic] equivalent, Gonna kill you resi biz. May force us to do moddyfitch only ...'"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another email between colleagues at Standard &amp; Poor's written before the bubble burst, suggests awareness of what would happen to the securities they were giving top ratings to: "Rating agencies continue to create and [sic] even bigger monster--the CDO market. Let's hope we are all wealthy and retired by the time this house of cards falters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Conflicts of interest===
Critics have claimed there was a conflict of interest for agencies—a conflict between accommodating clients for whom higher ratings of debt mean higher earnings, and accurately rating the debt for the benefit of the debt buyer/investor customers, who provide no revenue to the agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9769471 | work=The Economist | title=Credit and blame | date=2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

One study of "6,500 structured debt ratings" produced by Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch, found ratings by agencies "biased in favour of issuer clients that provide the agencies with more rating business. This result points to a powerful conflict of interest, which goes beyond the occasional disagreement among employees."&lt;ref name="EfingHau"/&gt;

===Unwillingness to spend on human resources===
While Moody's and other credit rating agencies were quite profitable—Moody's operating margins were consistently over 50%, higher than famously successful Exxon Mobil or Microsoft, and its stock rose 340% between the time it was spun off into a public company and February 2007&lt;ref&gt;McLean and Nocera, ''All the Devils Are Here'' 2010, (p.124)&lt;/ref&gt;—salaries and bonuses for non-management were low by Wall Street standards and its employees complained of overwork.

According to journalists McLean and Nocera, "The analysts in structured finance were working 12 to 15 hours a day. They made a fraction of the pay of even a junior investment banker. There were far more deals in the pipeline than they could possibly handle. They were overwhelmed. Moody's top brass ... wouldn't add staff because they didn't want to be stuck with the cost of employees if the revenues slowed down."&lt;ref&gt;McLean and Nocera, ''[[All the Devils Are Here]]'', 2010,  (p.123)&lt;/ref&gt;

Moody's Team manager Gary Witt complained that "penny-pinching" and "stingy" management was reluctant to pay up for experienced employees. "The problem of recruiting and retaining good staff was insoluble. Investment banks often hired away our best people. As far as I can remember, we were never allocated funds to make counter offers. We had almost no ability to do meaningful research."&lt;ref name="FCIR-p149"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Financial Crisis Inquiry Report |year=2011 |publisher=National Commission on the Causes of the Financial and Economic Crisis in the United States |page=149 |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about this by the FCIC, Moody's president [[Brian Clarkson]] admitted that investment banks paid more than his agency so retaining employees was "a challenge".&lt;ref name=retaining/&gt;

===Manipulation of ratings===
Journalist [[Michael Lewis]] argues that the low pay of credit rating agency employees allowed security issuers to game the ratings of their securities. Lewis quotes one [[Goldman Sachs]] "trader-turned hedge fund manager" telling him, "guys who can't get a job on Wall Street get a job at Moody's," as Moody's paid much less.
This was despite the fact that a job at Moody's—or any of the other rating agencies—gave an analyst the power to upgrade or downgrade a security, whereas the higher paid analysts' recommendations at Wall Street investment banks had no such impact on the market.&lt;ref name="short-cares"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Michael|title=The Big Short : Inside the Doomsday Machine|publisher=WW Norton and Co|page=156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNarLsnZyPoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=big+short&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gj4ZUurHOoKr2wXY14DwBw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=big%20short&amp;f=false\page=156|quote=Nobody gives a f**k if Goldman Sachs likes General Electric paper, if Moody's downgrades GE paper, it is a big deal. So why does the guy at Moody's want to work at Goldman Sachs? The guy who is a bank analyst at Goldman's should want to go to Moody's. It should be that elite.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the difference in pay meant that the "smartest" analysts at the credit rating agencies "leave for Wall Street firms where they could use their knowledge (of criteria used to rate securities) to manipulate the companies they used to work for." Consequently, it was widely known on Wall Street that the "inner workings" of the rating models used by the credit rating agencies, while "officially, a secret", "were ripe for exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael 
''The Big Short'', 2010, (p.156)&lt;/ref&gt; At least one other investment firm that bet against the agencies' credit ratings with huge success believed "there was a massive amount of gaming going on."&lt;ref name=gaming&gt;see also {{cite book|last=NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS IN THE UNITED STATES|title=Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission Report|year=2010|publisher=GPO|page=193|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf|quote=Betting against CDOs was also, in some cases, a bet against the rating agencies and their models. Jamie Mai and Ben Hockett, principals at the small investment firm [[Cornwall Capital]], told the FCIC that they had warned the SEC in 2007 that the agencies were dangerously overoptimistic in their assessment of mortgage-backed CDOs. Mai and Hockett saw the rating agencies as “the root of the mess,” because their ratings removed the need for buyers to study prices and perform due diligence, even as “there was a massive amount of gaming going on.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by the FCIC Commission about "the high turnover" and "revolving door that often left raters dealing with their old colleagues, this time as clients", Moody's officials stated their employees were prohibited from rating deals by a bank or issuer while they were interviewing for a job with that particular institution, but notifying management of any such interview was the responsibility of the employee. After getting a job at an investment bank, former employees were barred from interacting with Moody's on "the same series of deals they had rated while in its employ", but not on any other deals with Moody's.&lt;ref name=retaining&gt;see also {{cite book|last=NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE CAUSES OF THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CRISIS IN THE UNITED STATES|title=Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission Report|year=2010|publisher=GPO|page=150|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ways of "gaming"====
What was it ex-rating agency analysts might show their new employers? According to the hedge fund managers Michael Lewis talked to who had bet against mortgages securities, there were a number of ways to game&lt;ref name=short/&gt; or "reverse-engineer" the raters' models.&lt;ref name=bottom/&gt;
 
Rating agencies judged creditworthiness of a pool of loans in part by looking at the averages of [[credit score]]s of borrowers who made up the security. The agencies used [[Credit score in the United States#FICO score|FICO]], the "best-known and most widely used credit score model". The average FICO score needed to be about 615 for a pool of loans to meet rating agencies' minimum standard and allow a maximum percentage of triple-A rated tranches.&lt;ref name=short&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Michael|title=The Big Short : Inside the Doomsday Machine|year=2010|publisher=WW Norton and Co|pages=99–100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNarLsnZyPoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=big+short&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gj4ZUurHOoKr2wXY14DwBw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=big%20short&amp;f=false\page=99-100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While using an average was less work than getting a list of the borrowers' individual scores or finding the [[standard deviation]] of the pool of scores, it left out useful information. A pool of loans composed of borrowers all of whom had a FICO score of 615 was likely far fewer defaults than a pool of loans with the same average but more dispersion—e.g.composed of borrowers half of whom had FICO scores of 550 and half 680, since someone who had earned a FICO score as low as 550 "was virtually certain to default". Knowing this blind spot, securities issuers who could no longer find high-FICO-scoring families who wanted to take out a mortgage found other ways to raise the average pool score.&lt;ref name=short/&gt;

One way was to convince immigrants to buy homes. People who had not been in the country long, often had "never failed to repay a debt, because they had never been given a loan". Such people had surprisingly high FICO scores if you ignored the short credit history or "thin file". Rating agencies did, and FICO scores ignored and personal or household income.&lt;ref name=short/&gt; Thus did low income immigrants increase the percentage of pool of loans that could be declared triple-A"&lt;ref name="short-97"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Michael|title=The Big Short : Inside the Doomsday Machine|year=2010|publisher=WW Norton and Co|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TNarLsnZyPoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=big+short&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gj4ZUurHOoKr2wXY14DwBw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=big%20short&amp;f=false\page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explain otherwise unlikely sounding press reports of a "Mexican strawberry picker with an income of $14,000 and no English" being "lent every penny he needed to buy a house of $724,000".&lt;ref name="short-97"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bubble&gt;{{cite web|title=Yearly Income, $14,000.

Other "opportunities" for issuers manipulating credit raters included 
*Moody's and S&amp;P favoring of "floating-rate mortgages with low teaser rates over fixed-rate" mortgages; 
*their lack of interest in whether "a loan had been made in a booming real estate market or a quiet one";
*whether a lender had a 'silent second',&lt;ref name=silent&gt;{{cite web|title=Silent Second Mortgages|url=http://www.mtgprofessor.com/silent_second_mortgages.htm|work=April 16, 2007, Revised May 23, 2007|publisher=The Mortgage Professor|quote=... both Moody's and S&amp;P favored floating-rate mortgages with low teaser rates over fixed-rate ones.  Or that they didn't care if a loan had been made in a booming real estate market or a quiet one.  Or that they were seemingly oblivious to the fraud implicit in no-doc loans.  Or that they were blind to the presence of 'silent seconds' -- second mortgages that left the homeowner with no equity in his home and thus no financial incentive not to hand the keys to the bank and walk away from it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. an undisclosed second mortgages that left the homeowner with no equity in his home and thus no financial incentive not abandon it if real estate prices declined; and 
*"the fraud implicit in [[no doc loan]]s".&lt;ref name=short/&gt;

"The models used by the rating agencies were riddled with these sorts of opportunities", according to Lewis. "The trick was finding them" before other security issuers did.&lt;ref name=short/&gt;

==Aftermath==
In 2006, the [[Credit Rating Agency Reform Act]] was passed, intending to break the dominance of the "big three" agencies—Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's, and Fitch—by making it easier to qualify as a "nationally recognized" ratings agency.

However, in 2013, McClatchy Newspapers found that "little competition has emerged in rating the kinds of complex home-mortgage securities whose implosion led to the 2007 financial crisis".&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt; In the 12 months that ended in June 2011, the SEC reported that the big three issued 97% of all credit ratings, down only 1% from 98% in 2007.&lt;ref name=gordon&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordon|first=Greg|title=Industry wrote provision that undercuts credit-rating overhaul |url=https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/economy/article24751870.html|accessdate=4 September 2013|newspaper=McClatchy|date=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.mcclatchydc.com/smedia/2013/08/07/18/16/15IKTY.La.91.jpg Status quo for rating agencies] (chart of percentage of outstanding credit ratings reported to the SEC 2007 and 2011; and Moody's revenue and income 1996, 2000, 2010, 2012)| mcclatchydc.com&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have complained that the criteria to designate a rating agency as "a nationally recognized statistical rating organization" was written by a "yet-to-be-identified official of one of the big three ratings agencies", and is so difficult that it has "prevented at least one potential competitor from winning approval and have dissuaded others from even applying".&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt; Former Federal Reserve chairman [[Paul Volcker]] complained in a September 2013 article on banking and the shortcoming of post-crisis financial reform, that "no meaningful reform of the credit-rating agencies has been undertaken".&lt;ref name=volker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volcker|first=Paul|title=The Fed &amp; Big Banking at the Crossroads|journal=New York Review of Books|date=August 15, 2013|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/aug/15/the-fed-big-banking-crossroads/?pagination=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2013, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's settled two "long-running" lawsuits "seeking to hold them responsible for misleading investors about the safety of risky debt vehicles that they had rated". The suits were filed in 2008 and had sought more than $700 million of damages. Settlement terms were not disclosed in both cases, and the lawsuits were dismissed "with prejudice", meaning they cannot be brought again.&lt;ref name=settle/&gt; Other lawsuits are still outstanding as of September 2013.&lt;ref name=payback&gt;{{cite news|last=REUTERS|title=S.&amp;P.

It said the government's “impermissibly selective, punitive and meritless” lawsuit was brought “in retaliation for defendants' exercise of their free-speech rights with respect to the creditworthiness of the United States of America.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the dozens of suits filed against them by investors involving claims of inaccurate ratings&lt;ref name=dozens/&gt; the rating agencies have defended themselves using a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] defense (based on the precedent of [[New York Times Co. v. Sullivan]]). This maintains a credit rating is an opinion protected as free speech and requires plaintiffs to prove actual malice by the agency&lt;ref name=nagy&gt;{{cite web|last=Nagy|first=Theresa|title=Note, Credit Rating Agencies and the First Amendment: Applying Constitutional Journalistic Protections to Subprime Mortgage Litigation|url=http://www.minnesotalawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Nagy_MLR.pdf|work=2009|publisher=Minnesota Law Review|accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some wonder if the defense will ultimately prevail.&lt;ref name=bet&gt;{{cite news|title=S&amp;P Lawsuit First Amendment Defense May Fare Poorly, Experts Say|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/04/sp-lawsuit-first-amendment_n_2618737.html|work=4 February 2013|publisher=Huff Post|accessdate=4 September 2013|quote=For nearly four years, credit rating agencies like Standard &amp; Poor's have tried to use the First Amendment as a shield against angry investors who have demanded compensation for bad bets on the housing market.|date=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stempel&gt;{{cite news|last=Stempel|first=Jonathan|title=US credit raters set back on First Amendment--judge|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/25/thornburg-firstamendment-decision-idUSN1E7AO0H720111125|work=25 November 2011|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=4 September 2013|date=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to columnist Floyd Norris at least one rating agency—S&amp;P—responded to the credit crisis by first tightening up its standards and sacrificing market share to restore its reputation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Popper|first=Nathaniel|title=Banks Find S.&amp;P.

This is because, according to Norris, for rating franchises to be worth anything, they must seem to be credible to investors. But once they overcome that minimal hurdle, they will get more business if they are less critical than their competitors.&lt;ref name=pick/&gt;
