'''Shaun Terence Young''' (20 June 1915 &amp;ndash; 7 September 1994) was a British [[film director]] and [[screenwriter]] best known for directing three [[List of James Bond films|James Bond films]], including the first two films in the series, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962) and ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963), as well as ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965).

==Biography==
The son of a [[Police Commissioner]] of the [[Shanghai Municipal Police]], Young was born in [[Shanghai, China]] and was [[Independent school (UK)|public-school]] educated. He read oriental history at [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge|St Catharine's College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].

==Film career==
Young began his career in the film industry as a screenwriter, earning a credit for [[Brian Desmond Hurst]]'s ''[[On the Night of the Fire]]'' (1939), ''[[A Call for Arms]]'' (1940), ''[[Dangerous Moonlight]]'' (1941), and ''[[A Letter from Ulster]]'' (1942) and for other directors on ''[[Secret Mission]]'' (1942), ''[[On Approval (1944 film)|On Approval]]'' (1944).

Commissioned in the [[Irish Guards]], Young was a tank commander during [[World War II]] where he participated in [[Operation Market Garden]] in [[Arnhem]], [[Netherlands]].

In 1946, he returned to assist Hurst again with the script of ''[[Theirs Is the Glory]]'', which told the story of the fighting around Arnhem Bridge. Arnhem, coincidentally, was home to an adolescent [[Audrey Hepburn]]. During the later filming of Young's film ''[[Wait Until Dark (film)|Wait Until Dark]]'', Hepburn and Young joked that he had been shelling his favorite star without even knowing it. 

Young worked on the screenplays for Hurst's ''[[Hungry Hill (film)|Hungry Hill]]'' (1947) and David McDonald's ''[[Bad Lord Byron]]'' (1949).

===Director===
Young's first sole credit as director (and also [[Christopher Lee]]'s film debut) was ''[[Corridor of Mirrors (film)|Corridor of Mirrors]]'' (1948), an acclaimed film made in France. He followed it with a musical ''[[One Night with You (1948 film)|One Night with You]]'' (1948); ''[[Woman Hater (1948 film)|Woman Hater]]'' (1948), a comedy with [[Stewart Granger]]; ''[[They Were Not Divided]]'' (1950), based on his own life in the [[Irish Guards]]. Young also directed ''[[Valley of Eagles]]'' (1951) and ''[[The Tall Headlines]]'' (1952).

===Warwick Films===
He then made the first film for [[Irving Allen]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]]'s [[Warwick Films]], ''[[The Red Beret]]'' with [[Alan Ladd]]. 

Young made ''[[That Lady]]'' (1955) in Spain with [[Olivia de Havilland]] and ''[[Storm Over the Nile]]'' (1955), an essentially shot-for-shot remake of the 1939 film ''The Four Feathers''.

Warwick asked Young back to do ''[[Safari (1956 film)|Safari]]'' (1956), a movie about the [[Mau Mau]], with [[Victor Mature]]. For the same company, he did ''[[Zarak]]'' (1957), also with Mature.

MGM hired him to make ''[[Action of the Tiger]]'' (1957) with [[Van Johnson]]; a young [[Sean Connery]] had a supporting role. ''[[No Time to Die (1958 film)|No Time to Die]]'' (1958) was Young's fourth film for Warwick, and third with Mature. He made ''[[Serious Charge]]'' (1959), which was [[Cliff Richard]]'s film debut; ''[[Too Hot to Handle (1960 film)|Too Hot to Handle]]'' (1960) with [[Jayne Mansfield]]; ''[[Black Tights]]'' (1961) in France; and ''[[Duel of Champions]]'' (1961) in Italy with Alan Ladd.

===James Bond===
Albert Broccoli and Irving Allen had split as a producing team, and Broccoli went into partnership with [[Harry Saltzman]] to make a series of films based on the James Bond novels. Broccoli used many of the crew he had worked with during his time at Warwick for the first Bond movies, including Young as director. Young made a crucial contribution to ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962), including recruiting Sean Connery to portray Bond. Actress [[Lois Maxwell]] later said that "Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, to his tailor, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macintyre|first1=Ben|title=For Your Eyes Only : Ian Fleming and James Bond|date=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=9780747598664|page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The movie was a huge success and was quickly followed by ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' (1963), an even bigger hit. During the filming, Young and a photographer nearly drowned when their helicopter crashed into the sea while filming a key sequence. They were rescued by other members of the film crew. Young was back behind the camera 30 minutes after being rescued.

Young was deluged with offers and elected not to direct ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''. Instead he made ''[[The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders]]'' (1965). Young was called back for ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965), the fourth Bond movie.

According to Young, he was offered and turned down the direction of Bond films ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' and ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''.

==European films==
Following ''Thunderball'', Young's work was focused in Europe.

Young directed part of the 1965 espionage [[portmanteau film]] ''[[The Dirty Game]]''.  He provided the story for ''[[Atout cœur à Tokyo pour OSS 117]]'' (1966) and directed the all-star ''[[The Poppy Is Also a Flower]]'' (1966). He followed this with ''[[Triple Cross (1966 film)|Triple Cross]]'' (1966), and ''[[The Rover (1967 film)|The Rover]]'' (1967). Young had a hit with ''[[Wait Until Dark (film)|Wait Until Dark]]'' with [[Audrey Hepburn]].  In a 1967 interview he said his three best films were ''Black Tights'', ''From Russia with Love'' and ''They Were Not Divided''.&lt;ref&gt;Terence Young's Post-Bond Views
Los Angeles Times 21 Feb 1967: e9. &lt;/ref&gt;

He then directed ''[[Mayerling (1968 film)|Mayerling]]'' (1968), with [[Omar Sharif]] and ''[[The Christmas Tree (1969 film)|The Christmas Tree]]'' (1969) with [[William Holden]].

He made three films with [[Charles Bronson]]: ''[[Cold Sweat (1970 film)|Cold Sweat]]'' (1970), ''[[Red Sun]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Valachi Papers (film)|The Valachi Papers]]'' (1972).

===Later films===
Young's later films include ''[[War Goddess]]'' (a.k.a. ''The Amazons'') (1973), and ''[[The Klansman]]'' (1974) (replacing [[Samuel Fuller]]). He worked on ''[[Jackpot (unfinished film)|Jackpot]]'' but the film was never finished.

Later credits include ''[[Bloodline (1979 film)|Bloodline]]'' (1979), ''[[Inchon (film)|Inchon]]'' (1982) about the [[Battle of Inchon]] with [[Laurence Olivier]], ''[[The Jigsaw Man (film)|The Jigsaw Man]]'' (1983) with [[Michael Caine]] and Olivier (replacing the original director), and ''[[Run for Your Life (1988 film)|Run for Your Life]]'' (1988). Olivier and Young had been friends since 1943 when Olivier had initially offered the direction of his film ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'' (1944) to Young, who declined.&lt;ref&gt;''Laurence Olivier'' by Donald Spoto, Fontana, 1992, p.214&lt;/ref&gt;

Young contributed to the screenplay for the Hong Kong film ''[[Foxbat]]'' (1977), which led to him being credited as co-director in some regions. Young was the editor of ''[[The Long Days]]'' (''[[Al-ayyam al-tawila]]'') (1980), a six-hour Iraqi [[telenovela]] about the life of [[Saddam Hussein]], which also led to him being credited as co-director in some regions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Bowden]], [https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200205/bowden "Tales of the Tyrant]", ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]], May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

His wife was the novelist [[Dorothea Bennett (novelist)|Dorothea Bennett]]. He died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while working on a documentary at the age of 79 in [[Cannes]].
