__NOTOC__
'''Duat''' ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:dwÍú£t#Egyptian|dwÍú£t]]}}, [[Egyptological pronunciation]] "do-aht", {{lang-cop|‚≤ß‚≤è}}, also appearing as ''Tuat'', ''Tuaut'' or ''Akert'', ''Amenthes'', ''Amenti'', or ''Neter-khertet'') is the [[underworld|realm of the dead]] in ancient [[Egyptian mythology]]. It has been represented in hieroglyphs as a star-in-circle: &lt;span style="font-size:150%;"&gt;ìáΩ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--or &lt;hiero&gt;N15&lt;/hiero&gt;--&gt;. The [[Ancient Egyptian deities|god]] [[Osiris]] was believed to be the lord of the underworld. He was the first mummy as depicted in the [[Osiris myth]] and he personified rebirth and life after death. The underworld was also the residence of various other gods along with Osiris. The ''Duat'' was the region through which the sun god [[Ra]] traveled from west to east each night, and it was where he battled [[Apep|Apophis]], who embodied the primordial chaos which the sun had to defeat in order to rise each morning and bring order back to the earth. It was also the place where people's souls went after death for judgment, though that was not the full extent of the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Burial chambers formed touching-points between the mundane world and the ''Duat'', and the [[ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#Íú£·∏´|Íú£·∏´]] (Egyptological pronunciation: "akh") "the effectiveness of the dead", could use tombs to travel back and forth from the ''Duat''.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch, pp. 33‚Äì35&lt;/ref&gt;

Each night through the Duat the sun god Ra travelled, signifying revivification as the main goal of the dead. [[Ra]] travelled under the world upon his [[Atet]] barge from west to east, and was transformed from its aged [[Atum]] form into [[Khepri]], the new dawning sun. The dead king, worshipped as a god, was also central to the mythology surrounding the concept of Duat, often depicted as being one with Ra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weigal|first1=Arthur Edward Pearse Brome|title=A guide to the antiquities of Upper Egypt from Abydos to the Sudan Frontier|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780710310026|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the sun god the dead king had to travel through the Kingdom of Osiris, the Duat, using the special knowledge he was supposed to possess, which was recorded in the ''[[Coffin Texts]]'', that served as a guide to the hereafter not just for the king but for all deceased. According to the ''[[Amduat]]'', the underworld consists of twelve regions signifying the twelve hours of the sun god's journey through it, battling Apep in order to bring order back to the earth in the morning; as his rays illuminated the Duat throughout the journey, they revived the dead who occupied the underworld and let them enjoy life after death in that hour of the night when they were in the presence of the sun god, after which they went back to their sleep waiting for the god's return the following night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=John H.|title=Death and the Afterlife in Ancient Egypt|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226791645|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|left|A section of the Egyptian [[Book of the Dead]] that is written on papyrus, showing the [[Weighing of the Heart]] in the Duat, where [[Anubis]] can be seen on the far right. The scales are shown with the feather balance, and [[Ammit]] awaits hearts that she must devour. The presence of Osiris at the gateway to the paradise of [[Aaru]] dates the papyrus to a late tradition of the myth.]]
Just like the dead king, the rest of the dead journeyed through the various parts of the Duat, not to be unified with the sun god but to be judged. If the deceased was successfully able to pass various demons and challenges, then he or she would reach the ''weighing of the heart''. In this ritual, the heart of the deceased was weighed by Osiris against the feather of Maat, which represents truth and justice. Any heart that is heavier than the feather was rejected and eaten by [[Ammit]], the devourer of souls, as these people were denied existence after death in the Duat. The souls that were lighter than the feather would pass this most important test, and would be allowed to travel toward [[Aaru]], the "Field of Rushes", an ideal version of the world they knew of, in which they would plough, sow, and harvest abundant crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=John H.|title=Death and the Afterlife in Ancient Egypt|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226791645|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is known of the ''Duat'' derives principally from funerary texts such as the ''[[Book of Gates]]'', the ''[[Book of Caverns]]'', the ''[[Coffin Texts]]'', the ''[[Amduat]]'', and the ''[[Book of the Dead]]''. Each of these documents fulfilled a different purpose and give a different conception of the ''Duat'', and different texts could be inconsistent with one another. Surviving texts differ in age and origin, and there likely was never a single uniform conception of the ''Duat'', as is the case of many theological concepts in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

The geography of ''Duat'' is similar in outline to the world the Egyptians knew. There are realistic features like rivers, islands, fields, lakes, mounds and caverns, but there were also fantastic lakes of fire, walls of iron and trees of turquoise. In the ''Book of Two Ways'', one of the ''[[Coffin Texts]]'', there is even a map-like image of the ''Duat''.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Coffin Texts]]'' were intended to guide people who had recently died through the ''Duat''{{'}}s dangerous landscape and to a life as an ''Íú£·∏´''. Emphasized in some of these texts are mounds and caverns, inhabited by [[Cavern deities of the underworld|gods, demons or supernatural animals]], which threatened the deceased along their journey. The purpose of the books is not to lay out a geography, but to describe a succession of rites of passage which the dead would have to pass to reach eternal life.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, pp. 138‚Äì140&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the many demon-like inhabitants of the ''Duat'', it is not equivalent to the conceptions of [[Hell]] in the [[Abrahamic religions]], in which souls are condemned with fiery torment; the absolute punishment for the wicked, in ancient Egyptian thought, was the denial of an afterlife to the deceased, ceasing to exist in ''Íú£·∏´'' form. The grotesque spirits of the underworld were not evil, but under the control of the gods, being present as various ordeals that the deceased had to face.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Duat'' was also a residence for various gods, including Osiris, [[Anubis]], [[Thoth]], [[Horus]], [[Hathor]], and [[Maat]], who all appear to the dead soul as it makes its way toward judgement.
