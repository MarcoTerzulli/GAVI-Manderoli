[[Image:recombinant formation of plasmids.svg|thumb|280px|right|Construction of recombinant DNA, in which a foreign DNA fragment is inserted into a plasmid vector. In this example, the gene indicated by the white color is inactivated upon insertion of the foreign DNA fragment.]]

'''Recombinant DNA''' ('''rDNA''') molecules are [[DNA]] molecules formed by laboratory methods of [[genetic recombination]] (such as [[molecular cloning]]) to bring together genetic material from multiple sources, creating [[DNA sequence|sequences]] that would not otherwise be found in the [[genome]].

Recombinant DNA is the general name for a piece of DNA that has been created by combining at least two strands. Recombinant DNA is possible because DNA molecules from all organisms share the same chemical structure, and differ only in the [[nucleotide]] sequence within that identical overall structure. Recombinant DNA molecules are sometimes called '''chimeric DNA''', because they can be made of material from two different species, like the mythical [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]]. R-DNA technology uses [[palindromic sequence]]s and leads to the production of [[sticky and blunt ends]].

The DNA sequences used in the construction of recombinant DNA molecules can originate from any [[species]]. For example, plant DNA may be joined to bacterial DNA, or human DNA may be joined with fungal DNA. In addition, DNA sequences that do not occur anywhere in nature may be created by the [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|chemical synthesis of DNA]], and incorporated into recombinant molecules. Using recombinant DNA technology and synthetic DNA, literally any DNA sequence may be created and introduced into any of a very wide range of living organisms.

Proteins that can result from the expression of recombinant DNA within living cells are termed ''recombinant proteins''. When recombinant DNA encoding a protein is introduced into a host organism, the recombinant protein is not necessarily produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosano|first=Germán L.|last2=Ceccarelli|first2=Eduardo A.|date=2014-04-17|title=Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli: advances and challenges|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=5|pages=172|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2014.00172|issn=1664-302X|pmc=4029002|pmid=24860555}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expression of foreign proteins requires the use of specialized expression vectors and often necessitates significant restructuring by
foreign coding sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promoters used to regulate gene expression|url=http://www.cambia.org/daisy/promoters/818.html|website=www.cambia.org|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recombinant DNA differs from genetic recombination in that the former results from artificial methods in the test tube, while the latter is a normal biological process that results in the remixing of existing DNA sequences in essentially all organisms.

==Creation==
[[File:Gene cloning.svg|thumb|300px]]
{{main|Molecular cloning}}

Molecular cloning is the laboratory process used to create recombinant DNA.&lt;ref name="isbn0-201-75054-6"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Campbell, Neil A.  |author2=Reece, Jane B..  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Biology (6th ed.) |publisher=Addison Wesley |location=San Francisco |year=2002 |pages=375–401 |isbn=978-0-201-75054-6 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-8153-4111-3"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Peter Walter |author2=Alberts, Bruce |author3=Johnson, Alexander S. |author4=Lewis, Julian |author5=Raff, Martin C. |author6=Roberts, Keith |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell (5th edition, Extended version) |publisher=Garland Science |location=New York |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-0-8153-4111-6 |oclc= |doi= }}.

Freeman |location=San Francisco |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7167-2866-5 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of two most widely used methods, along with [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), used to direct the replication of any specific DNA sequence chosen by the experimentalist. There are two fundamental differences between the methods. One is that molecular cloning involves replication of the DNA within a living cell, while PCR replicates DNA in the test tube, free of living cells. The other difference is that cloning involves cutting and pasting DNA sequences, while PCR amplifies by copying an existing sequence.

Formation of recombinant DNA requires a [[Vector (molecular biology)|cloning vector]], a DNA molecule that replicates within a living cell. Vectors are generally derived from [[plasmid]]s or [[virus]]es, and represent relatively small segments of DNA that contain necessary genetic signals for replication, as well as additional elements for convenience in inserting foreign DNA, identifying cells that contain recombinant DNA, and, where appropriate, expressing the foreign DNA. The choice of vector for molecular cloning depends on the choice of host organism, the size of the DNA to be cloned, and whether and how the foreign DNA is to be expressed.&lt;ref name="isbn0-87969-576-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Russell, David W. |author2=Sambrook, Joseph |title=Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory |location=Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y |year=2001 |pages= |isbn=978-0-87969-576-7 |oclc= |doi= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/molecularcloning0000samb_p7p5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA segments can be combined by using a variety of methods, such as restriction enzyme/ligase cloning or [[Gibson assembly]].

In standard cloning protocols, the cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves seven steps: (1) Choice of host organism and cloning vector, (2) Preparation of vector DNA, (3) Preparation of DNA to be cloned, (4) Creation of recombinant DNA, (5) Introduction of recombinant DNA into the host organism, (6) Selection of organisms containing recombinant DNA, and (7) Screening for clones with desired DNA inserts and biological properties.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-2866-4" /&gt;
''These steps are described in some detail in a related article ([[molecular cloning]]).''

==Expression==
{{main|Protein production}}
Following transplantation into the host organism, the foreign DNA contained within the recombinant DNA construct may or may not be [[Gene expression|expressed]]. That is, the DNA may simply be replicated without expression, or it may be [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] and [[Translation (biology)|translated]] and a recombinant protein is produced. Generally speaking, expression of a foreign gene requires restructuring the gene to include sequences that are required for producing an [[mRNA]] molecule that can be used by the host's [[Translation (biology)|translational apparatus]] (e.g. [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]], [[Shine-Dalgarno sequence|translational initiation signal]], and [[Terminator (genetics)|transcriptional terminator]]).&lt;ref name="pmid9487731"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Properties of organisms containing recombinant DNA==
In most cases, organisms containing recombinant DNA have apparently normal [[phenotype]]s. That is, their appearance, behavior and metabolism are usually unchanged, and the only way to demonstrate the presence of recombinant sequences is to examine the DNA itself, typically using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4051-1121-6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Terry |title=Gene Cloning and DNA Analysis: an Introduction |publisher=Blackwell Pub |location=Cambridge, MA |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-1-4051-1121-8 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant exceptions exist, and are discussed below.

If the rDNA sequences encode a gene that is expressed, then the presence of RNA and/or protein products of the recombinant gene can be detected, typically using [[RT-PCR]] or [[Western blot|western hybridization]] methods.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4051-1121-6"/&gt; Gross phenotypic changes are not the norm, unless the recombinant gene has been chosen and modified so as to generate biological activity in the host organism.&lt;ref name="pmid|10634784"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional phenotypes that are encountered include toxicity to the host organism induced by the recombinant gene product, especially if it is [[Protein expression (biotechnology)|over-expressed]] or expressed within inappropriate cells or tissues.

In some cases, recombinant DNA can have deleterious effects even if it is not expressed. One mechanism by which this happens is [[Insertion (genetics)|insertional inactivation]], in which the rDNA becomes inserted into a host cell's gene. In some cases, researchers use this phenomenon to "[[Gene knockout|knock out]]" genes to determine their biological function and importance.&lt;ref name="pmid1591000"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mechanism by which rDNA insertion into chromosomal DNA can affect gene expression is by inappropriate activation of previously unexpressed host cell genes. This can happen, for example, when a recombinant DNA fragment containing an active promoter becomes located next to a previously silent host cell gene, or when a host cell gene that functions to restrain gene expression undergoes insertional inactivation by recombinant DNA.

==Uses==

Recombinant DNA is widely used in [[biotechnology]], [[medicine]] and [[research]]. Today, recombinant proteins and other products that result from the use of DNA technology are found in essentially every western pharmacy, physician or veterinarian office, medical testing laboratory, and biological research laboratory. In addition, organisms that have been manipulated using recombinant DNA technology, as well as products derived from those organisms, have found their way into many farms, [[Genetically modified food|supermarkets]], [[Humulin|home medicine cabinets]], and even pet shops, such as those that sell [[GloFish]] and other [[genetically modified animal]]s.

The most common application of recombinant DNA is in basic research, in which the technology is important to most current work in the biological and biomedical sciences.&lt;ref name="isbn1-4051-1121-6" /&gt; Recombinant DNA is used to identify, map and sequence genes, and to determine their function. rDNA probes are employed in analyzing gene expression within individual cells, and throughout the tissues of whole organisms. Recombinant proteins are widely used as reagents in laboratory experiments and to generate antibody probes for examining protein synthesis within cells and organisms.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8153-4111-3" /&gt;

Many additional practical applications of recombinant DNA are found in industry, food production, human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and bioengineering.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8153-4111-3" /&gt; Some specific examples are identified below.

;Recombinant [[chymosin]] {{not a typo|:}} Found in [[rennet]], chymosin is an enzyme required to manufacture cheese. It was the first genetically engineered food additive used commercially. Traditionally, processors obtained chymosin from rennet, a preparation derived from the fourth stomach of milk-fed calves. Scientists engineered a non-pathogenic strain (K-12) of ''E. coli'' bacteria for large-scale laboratory production of the enzyme. This microbiologically produced recombinant enzyme, identical structurally to the calf derived enzyme, costs less and is produced in abundant quantities. Today about 60% of U.S. hard cheese is made with genetically engineered chymosin. In 1990, FDA granted chymosin "[[generally recognized as safe]]" (GRAS) status based on data showing that the enzyme was safe.&lt;ref&gt;Donna U. Vogt and Mickey Parish.

==Controversy ==
Scientists associated with the initial development of recombinant DNA methods recognized that the potential existed for organisms containing recombinant DNA to have undesirable or dangerous properties. At the 1975 [[Asilomar Conference on Recombinant DNA]], these concerns were discussed and a voluntary moratorium on recombinant DNA research was initiated for experiments that were considered particularly risky. This moratorium was widely observed until the National Institutes of Health (USA) developed and issued formal guidelines for rDNA work. Today, recombinant DNA molecules and recombinant proteins are usually not regarded as dangerous. However, concerns remain about some organisms that express recombinant DNA, particularly when they leave the laboratory and are introduced into the environment or food chain. These concerns are discussed in the articles on [[genetically modified organism]]s and [[genetically modified food controversies]]. Furthermore, there are concerns about the by-products in biopharmaceutical production, where recombinant DNA result in specific protein products. The major by-product, termed [[host cell protein]], comes from the host expression system and poses a threat to the patient's health and the overall environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Xing|last2=Hunter|first2=Alan K.|last3=Mozier|first3=Ned M.|date=2009-06-15|title=Host cell proteins in biologics development: Identification, quantitation and risk assessment|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|language=en|volume=103|issue=3|pages=446–458|doi=10.1002/bit.22304|pmid=19388135|issn=0006-3592}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bracewell|first=Daniel G.|last2=Francis|first2=Richard|last3=Smales|first3=C.
