==IRS==
"Near the end of [[2002]], Justin Timberlake lost his home because Timberlake did not pay his taxes to the [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]."

Can anyone substantiate this? A quick Yahoo! search reveals no reference to IRS troubles. One of the first episodes of MTV's "Punk'd" did involve a sham seizure of Timberlake's property, however, this was not an acutal seizure. Other than "Punk'd," does anyone have any evidence of Justin having problems with the IRS?[[User:Essjay|Essjay]] 03:29, May 9, 2005 (UTC)

He was the first star to get Punk'd by Ashton Kutcher.
About the Timberlake lost his home, it was just a joke that was aired on Punk'd.

----
Since this particular bit of trivia keeps finding its way back into the article, I have cleaned up the reference and made it clear that it was part of a television stunt. [[User:Essjay|Essjay]] 21:36, May 12, 2005 (UTC)

I thought that Timberlake lost his home by Ashton Kutcher.

No, he did not. It was a stunt for Kutcher's television show. It was not real, Timberlake did not lose his home, he did not owe back taxes, it was only a prank for television. [[User:Essjay|Essjay]] 23:48, Jun 5, 2005 (UTC)

== Gay icon ==

Justin IS a gay icon.  He has been featured in craploads of gay magazines and has been a gay fave for years.

:What I don't understand is the reason for including the following text under Rumors:

:"In a VH1 special during the summer of 2005, it was suggested that Timberlake, along with other musicians, market themselves to a homosexual audience to increase sales."

:So, there's a rumor that a VH1 special during the summer of '05 suggested that he market himself to gay men? Or, is the rumor that he plans to heed that advice? Further, why is this particularly noteworthy? It is by no means unheard of for a popstar to market themselves to a particular audience, nor is it unheard of for a popstar to market themselves to the increasingly visible gay male audience. I, for one, would encourage Timberlake to position himself to market to everyone and maybe even to focus some specific time/energy/money on gay (typically young) men. But that doesn't mean I think we need to single out a comment made on VH1 for this article. Comments? [[User:Lekoman|Lekoman]] 02:14, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

== In August, 2005... ==

Justin Timberlake may have done several things in August, 2005, but signing some kid from Ohio to a record contract doesn't appear to be one of them.  Even if it were true, this is hardly worthy of mention in the article for Justin Timberlake.  Judging from [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Joshua B|VfD on 24 August]], some kid is trying to get their name in lights... the lights of computer screens, that is. -- [[User:SwissCelt|SwissCelt]] 03:36, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

==Fraternal Twin==
Justin has a twin? [[User:OmegaWikipedia|OmegaWikipedia]] 10:03, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

Justin has a twin sister Laura Catherine who died shortly after birth. He has an angel tattoo on his back in honor of both his sister and his mother.

== Wigger? ==
Someone might want to remove that under the "See Also" part. It looks like someone defaced the article. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class="autosigned"&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:70.157.132.10|70.157.132.10]] ([[User talk:70.157.132.10|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/70.157.132.10|contribs]]) 15:58, December 27, 2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Justin Timberlake did not have a twin sister. ==

Laura Katherine Timberlake was Justin's stepsister.  I don't have a direct link, but this appeared in the online archives of the Memphis Commerical Appeal ([http://web.commercialappeal.com/newgo/core/archives.htm]), from the week of May, 13, 1997:

"LAURA KATHERINE TIMBERLAKE, newborn daughter of Randy and Lisa Timberlake of Millington, died Tuesday at Methodist Hospital North of complications following birth. Private family graveside services will be at 2 p.m. today at Woodhaven Memory Gardens in Millington. Woodhaven Funeral Home in Millington has charge. She also leaves a brother, Jonathan Timberlake, and a stepbrother, Justin Timberlake, both of Millington, and her grandparents, Charles and Bobbie Timberlake of Memphis, Mack Perry of Millington and Sue Perry of Harrisburg, Ark." &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class="autosigned"&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Shalom yall|Shalom yall]] ([[User talk:Shalom yall|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Shalom yall|contribs]]) 15:16, December 30, 2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

== Grammys 2014 ==

* http://www.thespec.com/whatson-story/4335024-grammy-predictions-2014-who-will-win-who-should-win-/
"BEST POP VOCAL ALBUM  Nominees: Paradise, Lana Del Rey; Pure Heroine, Lorde; Unorthodox Jukebox, Bruno Mars; Blurred Lines, Robin Thicke; The 20/20 Experience — The Complete Experience, '''Justin Timberlake'''.  Who Will Win: This is gonna boil down to a Mars vs. '''Timberlake''' battle, methinks, but Timbo should prevail on the strength of sheer audacity — two albums and 140 minutes' worth of epic R&amp;B jams — and the fact that '''he's the biggest-selling artist of 2014'''. Who Should Win: '''Timberlake'''. There's a lot of fat to trim on the two 20/20 discs but he's had a monster comeback year." — To watch, FYI, [[User:Charles Edwin Shipp|Charles Edwin Shipp]] ([[User talk:Charles Edwin Shipp|talk]]) 16:02, 25 January 2014 (UTC)
:FYI, to close the loop: [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/music/la-et-ms-grammy-awards-2014-main,0,3915074.story#axzz2rZfYrt5Z] "Mars’ ''Unorthodox Jukebox'' was named pop vocal album of the year, topping efforts from Robin Thicke, '''Timberlake''', Lorde and Lana Del Rey and giving the R&amp;B star an emotional boost after major tragedy in his life last year." [[User:Charles Edwin Shipp|Charles Edwin Shipp]] ([[User talk:Charles Edwin Shipp|talk]]) 06:00, 27 January 2014 (UTC)  So Timberlake's musical comeback did not trump Mars' comeback from "major tragedy". Justin Timberlake won with some other artists, but his album didn't, FYI.

* Rap/sung collaboration:  "Holy Grail," Jay Z with Justin Timberlake
* R&amp;B song: "Pusher Love Girl," James Fauntleroy, Jerome Harmon, Timothy Mosley and Justin Timberlake

== Singer-Songwriter? Or Singer AND Songwriter? ==

Can I get a clear definition of Singer-songwriter, because if singer-songwriter is one who composes, writes, and sings, then Timberlake applies. --[[User:Joseph Prasad|Joseph Prasad]] ([[User talk:Joseph Prasad|talk]]) 04:04, 15 October 2014 (UTC)
:There is an ongoing discussion about this at [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Music#RfC: How should music BLPs approach the term "singer-songwriter"?]], and so far it seems that consensus is that [[singer-songwriter]] only applies to folk/acoustic singers such as [[James Taylor]] and [[Joni Mitchell]] who write, compose, and perform their own material.

:The material in an infobox should succinctly summarize "who is this person?" to someone unfamiliar with them: their reason for notability. Listing minor or ancillary roles gets in the way of that (and can mislead with [[WP:UNDUE|undue weight]]) without adding value to the casual reader.

:It should not be that complicated.

== Intro rework ==

'''Justin Randall Timberlake''' (born January 31, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, actor, and record producer. Born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], he appeared on the television shows ''[[Star Search]]'' and ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club#1989–1990s revival, The All-New Mickey Mouse Club)|The All-New Mickey Mouse Club]]'' as a child. In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two [[lead vocalist]]s and youngest member of the [[boy band]] [[NSYNC]], which eventually became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. During the group's hiatus, Timberlake released his debut studio album ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'', which included the successful singles "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]" and "[[Rock Your Body]]", and earned him his first two [[Grammy award]]s.

His second record, ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]]'', debuted atop the U.S. ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|200]] and produced the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles "[[SexyBack]]", "[[My Love (Justin Timberlake song)|My Love]]", and "[[What Goes Around... Comes Around]]". With his first two album exceeding sales of 10 million copies worldwide, he was established as one of the most commercially successful singers of the decade. From 2007 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus; he held starring roles in the films ''[[The Social Network]]'', ''[[Bad Teacher]]'', ''[[In Time]]'', and ''[[Friends with Benefits (film)|Friends with Benefits]]''.

In 2013, Timberlake resumed his music career with his third and fourth albums ''[[The 20/20 Experience]]'' and ''[[The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2]]'', exploring [[neo soul]] styles with the [[song structure]]s of 1960s and 1970s rock. The former became the [[List of best-selling albums by year in the United States|best-selling record of the year]] and spawned the top-three singles "[[Suit &amp; Tie]]" and "[[Mirrors (Justin Timberlake song)|Mirrors]]", while the latter produced the top-ten song "[[Not a Bad Thing]]". ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named him one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2007 and 2013. Timberlake's work has earned him [[List of awards and nominations received by Justin Timberlake|numerous awards]], including nine [[Grammy Award]]s and four [[Emmy Award]]s, the latter being for his acclaimed appearances on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. His other ventures include record label [[Tennman Records]], fashion label [[William Rast]], and the restaurants Destino and Southern Hospitality.

:SNL is an important part of his career, needs to appear somehow; former/latter appear twice in the real intro. When FS/LS was released *nsync wasn't in a hiatus anymore. [[User:Cornerstonepicker|Cornerstonepicker]] ([[User talk:Cornerstonepicker|talk]]) 02:52, 13 October 2015 (UTC)

== Singer-songwriter? ==

By the definition given on WP, "Singer-songwriters are musicians who write, compose, and perform their own musical material". Timberlake is the main writer and producer in all his (solo) music repertoire, as co-, his team of 3 people. "Singer-songwriter" is more accurate than "singer and songwriter".

:{{ping|Musdan77}} {{ping|SNUGGUMS}} {{ping|6033CloudyRainbowTrail}} pls I'd like your opinions. [[User:Cornerstonepicker|Cornerstonepicker]] ([[User talk:Cornerstonepicker|talk]]) 03:26, 29 March 2017 (UTC)
::[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/singer-songwriter Dictionary.com] says "a performer who writes his or her own songs", [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/singer-songwriter English Oxford Dictionary] defines the term as "A person who sings and writes popular songs, especially professionally", [https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/singer-songwriter Collins English Dictionary] describes this as "someone who writes and performs their own songs, especially popular songs", and [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/singer-songwriter Merriam-Webster Dictionary] refers to it as "a performer who writes songs and sings them". None of these seem to suggest people have to be the sole writer, but they should definitely do some of the writing. I personally don't have a preference on which terms to use, but thought it would help to have those definitions in mind. [[User:SNUGGUMS|&lt;b style="color:#454545"&gt;Snuggums&lt;/b&gt;]] ([[User talk:SNUGGUMS|&lt;b style="color:#454545"&gt;talk&lt;/b&gt;]] / [[Special:Contributions/SNUGGUMS|&lt;b style="color:#454545"&gt;edits&lt;/b&gt;]]) 03:38, 29 March 2017 (UTC)

:::1) Cornerstonepicker doesn't give a link to [[Singer-songwriter]]. (2) Two of the definitions quoted by Snuggums say "''own'' songs". If you look up the word "own"... I find: "indicates oneself as the ''sole'' agent of some activity or action." So, it ''does'' "suggest" that. (3) The WP page gives AllMusic as a source, which its definition says, "the term Singer/Songwriter refers to the legions of performers that followed Bob Dylan in the late 60s and early 70s. Most of the original singer/songwriters performed alone with an acoustic guitar or a piano but some had small groups for backing. Their lyrics were personal, although they were often veiled by layers of metaphors and obscure imagery. Singer/songwriters drew primarily from folk and country, although certain writers like Randy Newman and Carole King incorporated the songcraft of Tin Pan Alley pop. The main concern for any singer/songwriter was the song itself, not necessarily the performance." --[[User:Musdan77|Musdan77]] ([[User talk:Musdan77|talk]]) 05:58, 29 March 2017 (UTC)

:::: I just checked the list of singer-songwriters from the US and found that in some of their wikipedia profiles (Beyonce, Meghan Trainer), it just says singer, songwriter even though they are in the list. But, I think that  singer-songwriter is applicable to JT's article too as he does most of the other work on his songs too. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_singer-songwriters#S.E2.80.93T
Sorry about not linking before. [[User:6033CloudyRainbowTrail|King Cobra]] ([[User talk:6033CloudyRainbowTrail|talk]]) 11:43, 29 March 2017 (UTC)

:::::Again, no wikilink. People, if you refer to a WP page, give the link! It's not hard. On the top of [[List of singer-songwriters|that page]] it says, "You can help by expanding it with reliably sourced entries." And yet there is not one reference on the whole page! Similar list articles, such as [[List of tenors in non-classical music]], don't allow any entries to be added without a source confirming that the person belongs on the list. That list really should be titled "List of singers who also write songs", but it's easier just to put "singer-songwriters". --[[User:Musdan77|Musdan77]] ([[User talk:Musdan77|talk]]) 19:00, 29 March 2017 (UTC)

::::::{{ping|Musdan77}} by link you mean a reference, like [http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7581169/songwriter-roundtable-justin-timberlake-sting-alicia-keys-pharrell this]? "Six of Hollywood's top singer-songwriters" [[User:Cornerstonepicker|Cornerstonepicker]] ([[User talk:Cornerstonepicker|talk]]) 19:56, 29 March 2017 (UTC)

::::::: I think this link is good enough for both the WP list as well as JT's page.[[User:6033CloudyRainbowTrail|King Cobra]] ([[User talk:6033CloudyRainbowTrail|talk]]) 20:04, 29 March 2017 (UTC)

:::::::By link, I was talking about mentioning or quoting a WP page but not giving the link to it. But that Billboard source is not bad – even though it's in contrast to the AllMusic one. And you misrepresent it by putting "Six of Hollywood's top singer-songwriters" in quotes, as if that's the title – when it's not, and the term "singer-songwriter" is only used once in the article. --[[User:Musdan77|Musdan77]] ([[User talk:Musdan77|talk]]) 20:26, 29 March 2017 (UTC)

:::::::: I quoted it because that's the relevant part for this discussion, regardless of how many times the author would repeat the term. Jic, here's others [http://www.nbc.com/the-tonight-show/guest/justin-timberlake/711] [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/lat-people-choice-19-la0012928501-20131125-photo.html] [http://fortune.com/2016/10/20/justin-timberlake-invests-bai/]. I believe the first I showed is more than enough. [[User:Cornerstonepicker|Cornerstonepicker]] ([[User talk:Cornerstonepicker|talk]]) 21:24, 29 March 2017 (UTC)

{{out}}Okay, I didn't realize that was a quote from the article, because you didn't make that clear in your post – and you capitalized "six", which it is not in the article. Anyway, if you want to change that back, adding one of those refs (because it's not found in the main body), I won't contest it. --[[User:Musdan77|Musdan77]] ([[User talk:Musdan77|talk]]) 23:24, 29 March 2017 (UTC)
