'''Microsoft Outlook''', or simply '''Outlook''', is a [[personal information manager]] from [[Microsoft]], available as a part of the [[Microsoft Office]] suite. Primarily an [[email]] application, it also includes a [[Calendaring software|calendar]], [[Time management#Software applications|task manager]], [[contact manager]], [[note taking]],  [[Journal (computing)|journal]], and web browsing.

It can be used as a [[Computer software|stand-alone application]], or can work with [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] and [[Microsoft SharePoint Server]] for multiple users in an organization, such as shared mailboxes and calendars, Exchange public folders, SharePoint lists, and meeting schedules.  Microsoft has also released mobile applications for most mobile platforms, including iOS and Android.  Developers can also create their own custom software that works with Outlook and Office components using [[Microsoft Visual Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/159204/top_10_reasons_to_use_outlook.html|title=Top 10 Reasons to Use Outlook|date=February 10, 2009|work=PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, [[Windows Phone]] devices can synchronize almost all Outlook data to Outlook Mobile.

In March 2020 Microsoft has announced the launch of a series of new features to appeal to business customers of its Teams platform. Microsoft ends February with a new set of features for its Teams platform. The chat and collaboration module now includes more efficient and more integrated waypoints, designed to simplify group work for companies and encourage them to adopt the Microsoft platform, which aims to become the chat platform of company par excellence. The main new feature, the integration of Teams and Outlook, which means that users can now move an email conversation directly from Outlook to a Teams chat by clicking a button, but also share a conversation from Teams to an email on Outlook. Microsoft has also added the ability to assign a tag to members of an organization so that users can better target their messages. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://business.devilhunter.net/2020/03/microsoft-teams-enriched-with-new.html |website=Zinios |title=Microsoft Teams enriched with a new Outlook integration |language=en |accessdate=March 4, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macintosh ===
Microsoft also released several versions of Outlook for [[classic Mac OS]], though it was only for use with Exchange servers. It was not provided as a component of Microsoft Office for Mac but instead made available to users from administrators or by download. The final version was Outlook for Mac 2001, which was fairly similar to Outlook 2000 and 2002 apart from being exclusively for Exchange users.

[[Microsoft Entourage]] was introduced as an Outlook-like application for Mac OS in Office 2001, but it lacked Exchange connectivity. Partial support for Exchange server became available natively in [[macOS|Mac OS X]] with Entourage 2004 Service Pack 2. Entourage is not directly equivalent to Outlook in terms of design or operation; rather, it is a distinct application that has several overlapping features including Exchange client capabilities. Somewhat improved Exchange support was added in Entourage 2008 Web Services Edition.

[[File:Microsoft Outlook 2011.png|thumb|250px|Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2011]]
Entourage was replaced by Outlook for Mac 2011, which features greater compatibility and parity with Outlook for Windows than Entourage offered. It is the first native version of Outlook for macOS.

Outlook 2011 initially supported Mac OS X's [[iSync|Sync Services]] only for contacts, not events, tasks or notes. It also does not have a Project Manager equivalent to that in Entourage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.macworld.com/reviews/product/671493/review/outlook_for_mac_2011.html | title=Microsoft Outlook for Mac 2011 | last=Welsh | first=John C. | work=[[Macworld]] | publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] | date=October 1, 2010 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Service Pack 1 (v 14.1.0), published on April 12, 2011, Outlook can now sync calendar, notes and tasks with Exchange 2007 and Exchange 2010.

On October 31, 2014, [[Microsoft]] released Outlook for Mac (v15.3 build 141024) with [[Office 365]] (a [[software as a service]] licensing program that makes Office programs available as soon as they are developed). Outlook for Mac 15.3 improves upon its predecessors with:&lt;ref name="outlook-for-mac-15.3" /&gt;
* Better performance and reliability as a result of a new threading model and database improvements.
* A new modern user interface with improved scrolling and agility when switching between Ribbon tabs.
* Online archive support for searching Exchange (online or on-premises) archived mail.
* Master Category List support and enhancements delivering access to category lists (name and color) and sync between Mac, Microsoft Windows and OWA clients.
* Office 365 push email support for real-time email delivery.
* Faster first-run and email download experience with improved Exchange Web Services syncing.&lt;ref name="outlook-for-mac-15.3"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.office.com/2014/10/31/new-outlook-mac-available-office-365-customers/ | title=New Outlook for Mac available to Office 365 | work=Office Blogs | date=October 31, 2014 | publisher=[[Microsoft]] | accessdate=November 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== iOS and Android ===
First released in April 2014 by the [[venture capital]]-backed [[startup company|startup]] [[Acompli]], the company was acquired by [[Microsoft]] in December 2014. On January 29, 2015, Acompli was re-branded as Outlook mobileâ€”sharing its name with the Microsoft Outlook desktop [[personal information manager]] and [[Outlook.com]] email service.&lt;ref name=verge-outlookmobile&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft rebrands Acompli as Outlook for iOS and Android|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/29/7936081/microsoft-outlook-app-ios-android-features|website=The Verge|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to its desktop counterpart, Outlook mobile offers an aggregation of attachments and files stored on [[cloud storage]] platforms; a "focused inbox" highlights messages from frequent contacts, and calendar events, files, and locations can be embedded in messages without switching apps. The app supports a number of email platforms and services, including [[Outlook.com]], [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] and [[G Suite]] among others.

Outlook mobile is designed to consolidate functionality that would normally be found in separate apps on mobile devices, similarly to [[personal information manager]]s on [[personal computer]]s. is designed around four "hubs" for different tasks, including "Mail", "Calendar," "Files" and "People". The "People" hub lists frequently and recently used contacts and aggregates recent communications with them, and the "Files" hub aggregates recent attachments from messages, and can also integrate with other online storage services such as [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Google Drive]], and [[OneDrive]].&lt;ref name=verge-acompliandroid&gt;{{cite web|title=Acompli brings its Exchange-friendly email app to Android|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/4/6099341/acompli-brings-its-exchange-friendly-email-app-to-android|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recode.net/2014/02/20/acompli-from-zimbra-and-vmware-vets-tees-up-a-swing-at-mobile-email/|title=Acompli, From Zimbra and VMware Vets, Tees Up a Swing at Mobile Email |last=Gannes|first=Liz|date=February 20, 2014|work=[[Re/code]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engadget-acompli"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/04/24/acompli-email-app/|title=Acompli Launches App to Simplify Mobile Email|last=Bell|first=Karissa|work=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-acompli"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304393704579530332026112164?KEYWORDS=Joanna+Stern&amp;mg=reno64-wsj|title=You're Emailing Wrong: The Best Mobile Apps for Managing Your Inbox|last=Stern|first=Joanna|date=April 29, 2014|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facility indexing of content for search and other features, emails and other information are stored on external servers.&lt;ref name=witpro-outlooksecurity&gt;{{cite web|last1=Redmond|first1=Tony|title=Do the ex-Acompli now Outlook clients really compromise security or is everyone overreacting?|url=http://windowsitpro.com/blog/do-ex-acompli-now-outlook-clients-really-compromise-security-or-everyone-overreacting|website=Windows IT Pro|publisher=Penton|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outlook mobile supports a large number of different e-mail services and platforms, including [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Exchange]], [[iCloud]], [[GMail]], [[G Suite]], [[Outlook.com]], and [[Yahoo! Mail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a567986/best-new-mobile-apps-for-ios-android-ifttt-midrive-more.html#~oRcNVU2vVxDLXK|title=Best new mobile apps for iOS, Android: IFTTT, miDrive, more|last=Langshaw|first=Mark|date=April 30, 2014|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/28/best-iphone-ipad-apps-tynker-acompli|title=20 best iPhone and iPad apps this week|last=Dredge|first=Stuart|date=April 28, 2014|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app supports multiple email accounts at once.&lt;ref name=zdnet-iosreview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kendrick|first1=James|title=Acompli for iOS review: Must-have app for BYOD|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/acompli-for-ios-review-must-have-app-for-byod/|website=ZDNet|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emails are divided into two inboxes: the "Focused" inbox displays messages of high importance, and those from frequent contacts. All other messages are displayed within an "Other" section.&lt;ref name=witpro-outlooksecurity/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnet-betterapps&gt;{{cite web|title=Better email apps for your iPhone|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/email-apps-for-your-iphone-ipad/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Files, locations, and calendar events can be embedded into email messages.

Like the desktop Outlook, Outlook mobile allows users to see appointment details, respond to Exchange meeting invites, and schedule meetings. It also incorporates the three-day view and "Interesting Calendars" features from Sunrise.&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.office.com/2016/09/13/introducing-outlooks-new-and-improved-calendar-on-ios-and-android/&lt;/ref&gt;

Files in the Files tab are not stored offline; they require Internet access to view.

Outlook mobile temporarily stores and indexes user data (including email, attachments, calendar information, and contacts), along with login credentials,&lt;ref name=oauth-office-365&gt;{{cite web|title=New access and security controls for Outlook for iOS and Android|url=https://blogs.office.com/2015/06/10/new-access-and-security-controls-for-outlook-for-ios-and-android|website=Office Blogs|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a "secure" form on [[Microsoft Azure]] servers located in the United States.&lt;ref name=outlook_ios&gt;{{cite web|title=Outlook for iOS and Android|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/EN-US/library/mt465744(v=exchg.150)|website=Microsoft TechNet|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Exchange accounts, these servers identify as a single [[Exchange ActiveSync]] user in order to fetch e-mail. Additionally, the app does not support [[mobile device management]], nor allows administrators to control how third-party cloud storage services are used with the app to interact with their users. Concerns surrounding these security issues have prompted some firms, including the [[European Parliament]], to block the app on their Exchange servers.&lt;ref name=networkworld-outlookapp&gt;{{cite web|title=Outlook for iOS, Android flagged for inherent security flaws|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2878816/microsoft-subnet/outlook-for-ios-android-flagged-for-inherent-security-flaws.html|website=NetworkWorld|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techtarget-outlooksecurity&gt;{{cite web|title=Security issues lead IT to block Outlook for iOS|url=http://searchconsumerization.techtarget.com/news/2240239514/Security-issues-lead-IT-to-block-Outlook-for-iOS|website=TechTarget|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=itworld-eublock&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Parliament blocks new Outlook apps over privacy concerns|url=http://www.itworld.com/article/2881635/eu-parliament-blocks-new-outlook-apps-over-privacy-concerns.html|website=IT World|accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft maintains a separate, pre-existing [[Outlook Web Access]] app for Android and iOS.&lt;ref name=itworld-eublock/&gt;

==== Outlook for phones and tablets ====
In January 2015, [[Microsoft]] released Outlook for phones and for tablets (v1.3 build) with [[Office 365]].&lt;ref&gt;
Compare:

 | publisher= [[Microsoft]]
 | accessdate= January 11, 2015
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
This was the first Outlook for these platforms with email, calendar, and contacts.

==== Outlook Groups ====
Outlook Groups was a mobile application for [[Windows Phone]], [[Windows 10 Mobile]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] that could be used with an Office 365 domain Microsoft Account, e.g. a work or school account. It is designed to take existing email threads and turn them into a group-style conversation. The app lets users create groups, mention their contacts, share Office documents via OneDrive and work on them together, and participate in an email conversation. The app also allows the finding and joining of other Outlook Groups. It was tested internally at Microsoft and launched September 18, 2015 for Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 10 Mobile users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowscentral.com/outlook-groups-app-now-available-windows-10-mobile|title=Outlook Groups app is now available for Windows 10 Mobile and Windows Phone 8.1|work=Windows Central|accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its initial launch on Microsoft's own platforms they launched the application for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] on September 23, 2015.&lt;ref name=Outlook-Groups-for-Android-launch&gt;{{cite news|last=Edmonds|first=Rich|title=Microsoft releases Outlook Groups for Android to help you engage with your team.|url=http://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-releases-outlook-groups-android-help-you-engage-your-team|newspaper=Android Central|date=23 September 2015|access-date=23 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117104933/http://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-releases-outlook-groups-android-help-you-engage-your-team|archive-date=17 November 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outlook Groups was updated on September 30, 2015 that introduced a deep linking feature as well as fixing a bug that blocked the "send" button from working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coppock|first=Mark|title=Microsoft updates Outlook Groups app on Windows phones, adds admin functions|url=http://www.winbeta.org/news/microsoft-updates-outlook-groups-app-windows-phones-adds-admin-functions|website=WinBeta|date=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 Microsoft added the ability to attach multiple images, and the most recently used document to group messages as well as the option to delete conversations within the application programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mspoweruser.com/outlook-groups-ios-updated-new-features/|title=Outlook Groups for iOS updated with new features.|work=MSPowerUser|date=29 March 2016|first=Michael|last=Allison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outlook Groups was retired by Microsoft on May 1, 2018 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Outlook Groups app is retiring.|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/outlook-groups-app-is-retiring-17ef4874-8b2a-4176-8c7e-998997c68334}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The functionality was replaced by adding the "Groups node" to the folder list within the Outlook mobile app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Use Groups in the Outlook mobile app |url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-groups-in-the-outlook-mobile-app-7804076e-0acc-48f6-87a1-083b98a5ffa2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet standards compliance ==

=== HTML rendering ===
Outlook 2007 was the first Outlook to switch from Internet Explorer rendering engine to [[Microsoft Word 2007]]'s. This meant that [[HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) items not handled by Word were no longer supported. On the other hand, HTML messages composed in Word look as they appeared to the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.email-standards.org/clients/microsoft-outlook-2007/ |title=Microsoft Outlook 2007 Report &amp;#124; Email Standards Project |work=email-standards.org |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affects publishing newsletters and reports, because they frequently use intricate HTML and CSS to form their layout. For example, forms can no longer be embedded in an email.

=== Support of CSS properties and HTML attributes ===
Outlook for Windows has very limited CSS support compared to various other e-mail clients. Neither [[Cascading Style Sheets#CSS 1|CSS1 (1996)]] nor [[Cascading Style Sheets#CSS 2|CSS2 (1998)]] specifications are fully implemented and many CSS properties can only to be used with certain HTML elements for the desired effect.&lt;ref name="campaignmonitor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/|title=CSS Support Guide for Email Clients â€“ Campaign Monitor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some HTML attributes help achieve proper rendering of e-mails in Outlook, but most of these attributes are already deprecated in the [[HTML#HTML versions timeline|HTML 4.0 specifications (1997)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/|title=HTML 4.0 Specification|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve the best compatibility with Outlook, most HTML e-mails are created using multiple boxed tables, as the table element and its sub-elements support the width and height property in Outlook. No improvements have been made towards a more standards-compliant email client since the release of Outlook 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/post/3769/a-designers-guide-to-outlook-2013|title=A designerâ€™s guide to Outlook 2013 and Office 365|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format ===
{{Main|Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format}}
Outlook and Exchange Server internally handle messages, appointments, and items as objects in a data model which is derived from the old proprietary [[Microsoft Mail]] system, the [[Rich Text Format]] from [[Microsoft Word]] and the complex [[Object linking and embedding|OLE]] general data model.&lt;ref&gt;Outlook Data Model Reference (page on the MailItem object class members), MSDN development documentation, [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff861252.aspx], retrieved May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  When these programs interface with other protocols such as the various Internet and X.400 protocols, they try to map this internal model onto those protocols in a way that can be reversed if the ultimate recipient is also running Outlook or Exchange.&lt;ref name="tnefphilosophy"&gt;Preface of the TNEF specification, Outlook 2010 edition, [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc815562%28v=office.14%29.aspx], retrieved May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

This focus on the possibility that emails and other items will ultimately be converted back to Microsoft Mail format is so extreme that if Outlook/Exchange cannot figure out a way to encode the complete data in the standard format, it simply encodes the entire message/item in a proprietary binary format called Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) and sends this as an attached file (usually named "winmail.dat") to an otherwise incomplete rendering of the mail/item.  If the recipient is Outlook/Exchange it can simply discard the incomplete outer message and use the encapsulated data directly, but if the recipient is any other program, the message received will be incomplete because the data in the TNEF attachment will be of little use without the Microsoft software for which it was created.&lt;ref name="tnefphilosophy" /&gt;  As a workaround, numerous tools for partially decoding TNEF files exist.

=== Calendar compatibility ===
Outlook does not fully support data and syncing specifications for calendaring and contacts, such as [[iCalendar]], [[CalDAV]], [[SyncML]], and [[vCard]] 3.0. Outlook 2007 claims to be fully iCalendar compliant; however, it does not support all core objects, such as VTODO or VJOURNAL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/office/editions/prodinfo/compare.mspx#EBAA|title=Microsoft Office 2003 editions comparison|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=October 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Outlook supports vCard 2.1 and does not support multiple contacts in the vCard format as a single file. Outlook has also been criticized for having proprietary "Outlook extensions" to these Internet standards.

== Security concerns ==
As part of its [[Trustworthy Computing]] initiative, Microsoft took corrective steps to fix Outlook's reputation in Office Outlook 2003. Among the most publicized security features are that Office Outlook 2003 does not automatically load images in HTML emails or permit opening executable attachments by default, and includes a built-in Junk Mail filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uwec.edu/help/outlook03/MAIL-junk.htm |title=Microsoft Outlook 2003: Using Junk E-mail Filters |work=uwec.edu |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire }}&lt;/ref&gt; Service Pack 2 has augmented these features and adds an anti-[[phishing]] filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/email/outlook_sp2_filters.mspx|title=Microsoft Internet Safety and Security Center|publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outlook add-ins ==
Outlook add-ins are small helping programs for the Microsoft Outlook application. The main purpose of the add-ins is to add new functional capabilities into Microsoft Outlook and automate some routine operations. The term also refers to programs where the main function is to work on Outlook files, such as synchronization or backup utilities. Outlook add-ins may be developed in [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] or third-party tools such as Add-in Express. Outlook add-ins are not supported in [[Outlook Web App]].

From Outlook 97 on, Exchange Client Extensions are supported in Outlook. Outlook 2000 and later support specific [[Component Object Model|COM]] components called Outlook AddIns. The exact supported features (such as [[.NET Framework|.NET]] components) for later generations were extended with each release.

=== SalesforceIQ Inbox for Outlook ===
In March 2016, [[Salesforce.com|Salesforce]] announced that its relationship intelligence platform, [[SalesforceIQ]], would be able to seamlessly integrate with Outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/10/salesforce-microsoft-love-grows-with-salesforceiq-outlook-integration/|title=Salesforce-Microsoft love grows with SalesforceIQ-Outlook integration {{!}} TechCrunch|last=Miller|first=Ron|access-date=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; SalesforceIQ works from inside the Outlook inbox providing data from CRM, email and customer social profiles. It also provides recommendations within the inbox on various aspects like meeting scheduling, contacts, responses etc.

=== Hotmail Connector ===
[[File:Outlook connector.png|thumb|Hotmail Connector setup screen]]
''Microsoft Outlook Hotmail Connector'' (formerly ''Microsoft Office Outlook Connector''), is a discontinued and defunct free add-in for Microsoft Outlook 2003, 2007 and 2010, intended to integrate [[Outlook.com]] (formerly Hotmail) into Microsoft Outlook. It uses [[DeltaSync]], a proprietary Microsoft communications protocol that Hotmail formerly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/microsoft-office-outlook-hotmail-connector-overview-HA010222518.aspx|title=Microsoft Office Outlook Hotmail Connector overview|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128151603/http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook-help/microsoft-office-outlook-hotmail-connector-overview-HA010222518.aspx|archive-date=28 January 2013|url-status=|work=[[Microsoft Office website]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In version 12, access to tasks and notes and online synchronization with [[MSN Calendar]] is only available to MSN subscribers of paid premium accounts. Version 12.1, released in December 2008 as an optional upgrade, uses [[Windows Live Calendar]] instead of the former [[MSN Calendar]]. This meant that calendar features became free for all users, except for task synchronization which became unavailable. In April 2008, version 12.1 became a required upgrade to continue using the service as part of a migration from [[MSN Calendar]] to [[Windows Live Calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ask.officelive.com/smallbusiness/blogs/team/archive/2009/04/02/outlook-connector-users-you-must-upgrade-to-a-new-version.aspx |title=Transition information for former Office Live Small Business customers â€“ Manage Office 365 â€“ Office 365 â€“ Microsoft Office 365 Community |publisher=Ask.officelive.com |date= |accessdate=June 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft Outlook 2013 and later have intrinsic support for accessing Outlook.com and its calendar over the [[Exchange ActiveSync]] (EAS) protocol,&lt;ref name="connector integrated"&gt;{{cite web|title=What's new in Outlook 2013|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179110(v=office.15)|work=[[Microsoft TechNet#Library|TechNet Library]]|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=March 1, 2013|date=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while older versions of Microsoft Outlook can read and synchronize Outlook.com emails over the [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-your-Outlook-com-account-in-Outlook-for-Windows-642c1902-bdd9-4dc3-abe7-76d60b148b23|title=Add your Outlook.com account in Outlook for Windows|last=|first=|date=|website=Office Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|access-date=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social Connector ===
''Outlook Social Connector'' was a free add-in for Microsoft Outlook 2003 and 2007 by Microsoft that allowed integration of social networks such as [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]] and [[Windows Live Messenger]] into Microsoft Outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Doug|title=How to install the Outlook Social Connector (video)|url=http://blogs.office.com/b/office_casual/archive/2010/08/24/how-to-install-the-outlook-social-connector.aspx|work=Office Casual blog|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=March 1, 2013|date=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first introduced in November 18, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcing the Outlook Social Connector|url=http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2009/11/18/announcing-the-outlook-social-connector.aspx|work=Outlook Blog|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=March 1, 2013|date=November 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with Microsoft Office 2010, Outlook Social Connector is an integral part of Outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changes in Outlook 2010 (for IT pros)|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179110%28office.14%29|work=[[Microsoft TechNet#Library|TechNet Library]]|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=March 1, 2013|date=November 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CardDAV and CalDAV Connector ===
Since Microsoft Outlook does not support CalDAV and CardDAV protocol along the way, various third-party software vendors developed Outlook add-ins to enable users synchronizing with [[CalDAV]] and [[CardDAV]] servers. [[CalConnect]] has a list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caldav.calconnect.org/implementations/clients.html|title=CalDAV Clients|url-status=dead|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523203324/http://caldav.calconnect.org/implementations/clients.html|archivedate=May 23, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; of software that enable users to synchronize their calendars with CalDAV servers/contacts with CardDAV servers.

== Importing from other email clients ==
Traditionally, Outlook supported importing messages from [[Outlook Express]] and [[IBM Lotus Notes|Lotus Notes]]. In addition, Microsoft Outlook supports [[POP3]] and [[IMAP]] protocols, enabling users to import emails from servers that support these protocols. Microsoft Hotmail Connector add-in (described above) helps importing emails from [[Hotmail]] accounts. Outlook 2013 later integrated the functionality of this add-in and added the ability to import email (as well as a calendar) through [[Exchange ActiveSync]] protocol.&lt;ref name="connector integrated" /&gt;

There are some ways to get the emails from [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]]; the first is to use a tool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broobles.com/imapsize/index.php|title=IMAPSize|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can convert a Thunderbird folder to a format that can be imported from Outlook Express. This method must be processed folder by folder. The other method is to use a couple of free tools that keep the original folder structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nektra.com/main/2009/04/14/export-messages-and-folders-from-thunderbird-to-outlook-outlook-express/|title=Export messages and folders from Thunderbird to Outlook/Outlook Express/Windows Mail|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Exchange is available, an easier method is to connect the old mail client (Thunderbird) to Exchange using IMAP, and upload the original mail from the client to the Exchange account.
