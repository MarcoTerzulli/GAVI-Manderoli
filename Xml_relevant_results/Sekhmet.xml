In [[Egyptian mythology]], '''Sekhmet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|k|ˌ|m|ɛ|t}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2012 |title=Sekhmet |encyclopedia=Dictionary.com |publisher=Random House }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Sachmis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|k|m|ᵻ|s}}), also spelled '''Sakhmet''', '''Sekhet''', or '''Sakhet''', among other spellings), is a warrior goddess as well as goddess of healing. She is depicted as a [[lion]]ess. She was seen as the protector of the [[pharaoh]]s and led them in warfare. Upon death, Sekhmet continued to protect them, bearing them to the afterlife.

Sekhmet is also a [[solar deity]], sometimes called the daughter of [[Ra]] and often associated with the goddesses [[Hathor]] and [[Bastet]]. She bears the [[Uraeus]], which associates her with [[Wadjet]] and royalty, and the [[Aten|solar disk]].

== Etymology ==
Sekhmet's name comes from the [[Ancient Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] word [[wikt:sḫm|''sḫm'']], which means "power or might". Sekhmet's name ({{Lang-egy|sḫmt}}, {{IPA|/'siχmit/}}, later [[Coptic language|Old]] {{lang-cop|ⲥⲁⲭⲙⲓ|transl=Sakhmi}}) is thus translated as "the (one who is) powerful or mighty". She also was given titles such as the "(One) Before Whom Evil Trembles", "Mistress of Dread", "Lady of Slaughter" and "She Who Mauls".

== Roles ==
{{Ancient Egyptian religion}}
Sekhmet was considered the daughter of the sun god, [[Ra]], and was among the more important of the goddesses who acted as the vengeful manifestation of Ra's power, the [[Eye of Ra]]. Sekhmet was said to breathe fire, and the hot winds of the desert were likened to her breath. She was also believed to cause plagues, which were called her servants or messengers, although she was also called upon to ward off disease.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt''. Thames &amp; Hudson. p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

In a myth about the end of Ra's rule on the earth, Ra sends the goddess [[Hathor]], in the form of Sekhmet, to destroy mortals who conspired against him. In the myth, Sekhmet's blood-lust was not quelled at the end of battle and led to her destroying almost all of humanity. To stop her Ra poured out beer dyed with red ochre or hematite so that it resembled blood. Mistaking the beer for blood, she became so drunk that she gave up the slaughter and returned peacefully to Ra.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtheim, Miriam (2006) [1976]. ''Ancient Egyptian Literature, Volume Two: The New Kingdom''. University of California Press. pp. 197–199&lt;/ref&gt; The same myth was also described in the prognosis texts of the Calendar of Lucky and Unlucky Days of papyrus Cairo 86637.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jetsu, L.|author2=Porceddu, S.|title=Shifting Milestones of Natural Sciences: The Ancient Egyptian Discovery of Algol's Period Confirmed|journal = PLOS ONE|volume = 10 |issue = 12|date = 2015|pages = e.0144140 (23pp)|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0144140|pmid=26679699|pmc=4683080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sekhmet was considered the wife of the god [[Ptah]] and mother of his son [[Nefertum]]. She was also said to be the mother of a lion god, [[Maahes]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, Richard H. (2003). ''The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt''. Thames &amp; Hudson. pp. 178, 181&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iconography ==
Sekhmet was envisioned as a fierce lioness, and in art, was depicted as such, or as a woman with the head of a lioness, who was dressed in red, the color of blood. Sometimes the dress she wears exhibits a rosetta pattern over each breast, an ancient leonine motif, which can be traced to observation of the shoulder-knot hairs on lions. Occasionally, Sekhmet was also portrayed in her statuettes and engravings with minimal clothing or naked.

The royal [[bier]]s were fashioned to represent Sekhmet symbolizing her role as protector, even in death. They are depicted in all images of the embalming rites, showing her head, the characteristic tufted tail, and her feet. In the tombs, the coffins were placed on them.

It is estimated that more than seven hundred [[Sekhmet statues|statues of Sekhmet]] once stood in one [[mortuary temple|funerary temple]] alone, that of [[Amenhotep III]], on the west bank of the [[Nile]].

== Worship ==
[[File:Egyptian - "Aegis" with the head of Sakhmet - Walters 57540 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumb|right|This golden cultic object is called an [[aegis]]. It is devoted to Sekhmet, highlighting her solar attributes. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]
During an annual festival held at the beginning of the year, a festival of intoxication, the Egyptians danced and played music to soothe the wildness of the goddess and drank great quantities of wine ritually to imitate the extreme drunkenness that stopped the wrath of the goddess—when she almost destroyed humanity. This may relate to averting excessive flooding during the inundation at the beginning of each year as well, when the Nile ran blood-red with the silt from up-stream.

In 2006, Betsy Bryan, an archaeologist with Johns Hopkins University excavating at the temple of [[Mut]] in Luxor (Thebes) presented her findings about the festival that included illustrations of the priestesses being served to excess and its adverse effects on them being ministered to by temple attendants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15475319 "Sex and booze figured in Egyptian rites"], archaeologists find evidence for ancient version of ‘Girls Gone Wild’. From [[NBC News]], October 30, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in the festival was great, including by the priestesses and the population. Historical records of tens of thousands attending the festival exist. These findings were made in the temple of Mut because when [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] rose to greater prominence Mut absorbed some characteristics of Sekhmet. These temple excavations at Luxor discovered a "porch of drunkenness" built onto the temple by the Pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] during the height of her twenty-year reign.

During the Greek dominance in Egypt, note was made of a temple for Maahes that was an auxiliary facility to a large temple to Sekhmet at [[Taremu]] in the Delta region, a city which the Greeks called Leontopolis.
