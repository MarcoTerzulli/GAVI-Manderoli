[[File:Dollarnote siegel hq.jpg|thumb|The Eye of Providence can be seen on the reverse of the [[Great Seal of the United States]], seen here on the [[United States one-dollar bill|US $1 bill]].]]
The '''Eye of Providence''' (or the '''all-seeing eye of God''') is a [[symbol]], having its origin in [[Christian iconography]], showing an eye often surrounded by [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]] or a [[Glory (religion)#Glory in art|glory]] and usually enclosed by a [[triangle]]. It represents the eye of [[God]] watching over [[human]]ity (the concept of [[divine providence]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-saints.info/catholic-symbols/eye-christian-symbol.htm|title=The eye as a Christian symbol|website=catholic-saints.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/symbols/eye_of_god.htm|title=The Eye as a religious symbol|website=Religiousfacts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/symbolism/eye.html|title=Freemasonry and the All-seeing Eye|website=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era, a notable depiction of the eye is the reverse of the [[Great Seal of the United States]], which appears on the [[United States one-dollar bill]]. 

== United States ==
[[File:SealOfTheUS Prototype.png|thumb|Original design for the [[Great Seal of the United States]] by [[Pierre Eugene du Simitiere|Simitiere]]]]

In 1782, the Eye of Providence was adopted as part of the symbolism on the reverse side of the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. It was first suggested as an element of the Great Seal by the first of three design committees in 1776 and is thought to be the suggestion of the artistic consultant, [[Pierre Eugene du Simitiere]].&lt;ref name="GSUSbooklet"&gt;''[https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/27807.pdf The Great Seal of the United States]'' booklet, published by [[United States Department of State|US Dept. of State]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his original proposal to the committee, Du Simitiere placed the Eye over shields symbolizing each of the original thirteen states of the Union. On the version of the seal that was eventually approved, the Eye is positioned above an unfinished [[pyramid]] of thirteen steps (again symbolizing the original States, but incorporating the nation's potential for future growth). The symbolism is explained by the motto that appears above the Eye: ''[[Annuit Cœptis]]'', meaning "He approves [our] undertakings" (or "has approved").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greatseal.com/mottoes/coeptis.html|title=Annuit Coeptis - History of Motto Above Great Seal's Eye of Providence|website=greatseal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greatseal.com/symbols/thirteen.html|title=Thirteen - America's Number On the Great Seal of the United States|website=greatseal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps due to its use in the design of the Great Seal, the Eye has made its way into other American seals and logos, for example: the [[Seal of Colorado]] and [[DARPA]]'s [[Information Awareness Office]].
== Brazil ==
[[File:Bandeira da Confedereção do Equador.png|thumb|left|The flag of the Confederation of the Equator, with  Eye of Providence in the palm on top.]]

The Eye of Providence was part of the flag and coat of arms adopted by the [[Confederation of the Equator]], a short lived 1824 secessionist revolt in the Northeastern provinces of [[Brazil]].

== Freemasonry ==
[[File:MasonicEyeOfProvidence.gif|thumb|An early [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] version of the Eye of Providence with clouds and a semi-circular glory]]
Today the Eye of Providence is often associated with [[Freemasonry]], although it is originally a Christian symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholic-saints.info/catholic-symbols/eye-christian-symbol.htm|title=Eye Christian Symbol|website=www.catholic-saints.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eye first appeared as part of the standard [[iconography]] of the Freemasons in 1797, with the publication of [[Thomas Smith Webb]]'s ''Freemasons Monitor''.&lt;ref&gt;S. Brent Morris, "[http://web.mit.edu/dryfoo/Masons/Essays/eyepyr.html The Eye in the Pyramid]," from the ''Short Talk Bulletin'' of the Masonic Service Association of the United States. Last revised: 01/13/2010 22:34:20. Retrieved 4 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Here, it represents the all-seeing eye of God and is a reminder that humanity's thoughts and deeds are always observed by God (who is referred to in Masonry as the [[Great Architect of the Universe]]). Typically, the Masonic Eye of Providence has a semi-circular glory below it. Sometimes this Masonic Eye is enclosed by a triangle.

Popular among [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] is the claim that the Eye of Providence shown atop an unfinished [[pyramid]] on the [[Great Seal of the United States]] indicates the influence of Freemasonry in the founding of the United States. However, common Masonic use of the Eye dates to 14 years after the creation of the Great Seal. Furthermore, among the members of the various design committees for the Great Seal, only [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a Mason (and his ideas for the seal were not adopted). Various Masonic organizations have explicitly denied any connection to the creation of the Seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/anti-masonry/anti-masonry02.html#eye_pyramid|website=Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon|title=Anti-masonry Frequently Asked Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/masonic_dollar.html|website=Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry|title=The "Masonic" One Dollar: Fact or Fiction?|first=David, W.Bro.|last=Barrett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious use ==
The association of an eye with the concept of [[Divine Providence]] did not emerge until well into the [[Christian era]]. In Renaissance European iconography, the eye surrounded by a triangle was an explicit image of the Christian [[Trinity]].{{Failed verification|date=July 2018|reason=the source provided explicitly connects this to Christianity only in the 18th century, not the renaissance.}}  Seventeenth-century depictions of the Eye of Providence sometimes show it surrounded by clouds or [[sunburst]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rFvu92GyDQoC&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The World's Eye|first=Albert M.|last=Potts|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|pages=68–78|isbn=978-0-8131-3130-6|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eye of God in a triangle is still used in church architecture and Christian art to symbolize the Trinity and God's [[omnipresence]] and [[divine Providence]].

In Buddhism, this is one of the higher powers, [[Abhijñā]]'s, that can be achieved during intensive meditative concentration or [[samadhi]]. The Divine Eye, Divine Vision, or in [[Pali]], dibba-cakkhu, allows one to see into the working law of karma. One can 'see' knowing others' karmic destinations; death and subsequent rebirth.
