''InSight''{{'s}} objectives are to place a [[seismometer]], called [[Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure|SEIS]], on the surface of Mars to measure seismic activity and provide accurate 3D models of the planet's interior; and measure internal [[heat transfer|heat flow]] using a heat probe called [[Heat Flow and Physical Properties Package|HP&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]] to study Mars' early geological evolution.&lt;ref name="insight-instrum"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/instruments/|title=What are InSight's Science Tools?|publisher=NASA|access-date=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could bring a new understanding of how the Solar System's [[terrestrial planet]]s&amp;nbsp;– Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars&amp;nbsp;– and Earth's Moon form and evolve.

''InSight'' was initially known as '''GEMS''' ('''Geophysical Monitoring Station'''), but its name was changed in early 2012 following a request by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/tn-8180228--jpl-changes-name-of-mars-mission-proposal-story.html|title=JPL changes name of Mars mission proposal|work=Times Community News via Los Angeles Times|first=Jason|last=Wells|date=28 February 2012 |access-date=25 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Out of 28 proposals from 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marsmobile.jpl.nasa.gov/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1316|title=New NASA Mission To take First Look Deep Inside Mars|publisher=NASA|date=20 August 2012|access-date=26 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604121730/http://marsmobile.jpl.nasa.gov/news/whatsnew/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&amp;NewsID=1316|archive-date=4 June 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was one of the three [[Discovery Program]] finalists receiving $3 million in May 2011 to develop a detailed concept study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/may/HQ_11-132_Future_Plantary.html|title=NASA Selects Investigations For Future Key Planetary Mission|publisher=NASA|date=5 May 2011|access-date=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2012, ''InSight'' was selected for development and launch.&lt;ref name=washington/&gt;  Managed by NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL) with participation from scientists from several countries, the mission was cost-capped at $425 million, not including launch vehicle funding.&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tgdaily.com/space-features/55816-nasa-picks-project-shortlist-for-next-discovery-mission|title=NASA picks project shortlist for next Discovery mission|work=TG Daily|last=Taylor|first=Kate|date=9 May 2011|access-date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

By reusing the landing system designed for the Mars [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|''Phoenix'' lander]], which successfully landed on Mars in 2008, mission costs and risks were reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cavendish|first1=Lee|url=https://www.space.com/42527-insight-mars-lander-journey-inside-red-planet.html|title=Journey to the Center of the Red Planet: NASA's InSight Lander to Reveal the Secrets Inside Mars|date=25 November 2018|work=Space.com|access-date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A persistent vacuum leak in the [[CNES]]-supplied seismometer known as the [[Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure]] (SEIS) led NASA to postpone the planned launch in March 2016 to May 2018. When ''InSight'' was delayed, the rest of the spacecraft was returned to Lockheed Martin's factory in Colorado for storage, and the [[Atlas V]] rocket intended to launch the spacecraft was reassigned to the ''[[WorldView-4]]'' mission.&lt;ref name="sfnow20160305"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/03/05/fate-of-nasas-insight-mars-mission-to-be-decided-soon/|title=Fate of NASA's InSight Mars mission to be decided soon|work=Spaceflight Now|first=Stephen|last=Clark|date=5 March 2016|access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 March 2016, NASA officials announced that ''InSight'' would be delayed until the 2018 launch window at an estimated cost of $150 million.&lt;ref name="sfnow20160309"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2016/03/09/insight-mars-lander-escapes-cancellation-aims-for-2018-launch/|title=InSight Mars lander escapes cancellation, aims for 2018 launch|work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen|last=Clark|date=9 March 2016|access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes20160309"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/science/nasa-reschedules-mars-insight-mission-for-may-2018.html|title=NASA Reschedules Mars InSight Mission for May 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Kenneth|last=Chang|date=9 March 2016|access-date=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft was rescheduled to launch on 5 May 2018 for a Mars landing on 26 November at 15:00. The flight plan remained unchanged with launch using an Atlas V rocket from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in California.{{r|sfnow20160309|nytimes20160309}} NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory was tasked with redesigning and building a new vacuum enclosure for the SEIS instrument, while CNES conducted instrument integration and testing.&lt;ref name="2nd chance"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2953/1|title=InSight's second chance|work=The Space Review|last=Foust|first=Jeff|date=28 March 2016|access-date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa20160309"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=5746|title=NASA Targets May 2018 Launch of Mars InSight Mission|publisher=NASA|date=9 March 2016|access-date= 9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 2017, ''InSight'' completed testing in a thermal vacuum, also known as TVAC testing, where the spacecraft is put in simulated space conditions with reduced pressure and various thermal loads.&lt;ref name="nasasf20171122"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2017/11/mars-insight-passes-tvac-testing-2018-launch/|title=Mars InSight mission passes TVAC testing ahead of 2018 launch|work=[[NASASpaceFlight.com]]|first=Chris|last=Bergin|date=22 November 2017|access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 January 2018, after a long storage, its solar panels were once again deployed and tested, and a second silicon chip containing 1.6&amp;nbsp;million names from the public was added to the lander.&lt;ref name="nasasf20180123"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8301/nasas-next-mars-lander-spreads-its-solar-wings/|title=NASA's Next Mars Lander Spreads its Solar Wings|publisher=NASA|first=Andrew|last=Good|date=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Science background ==
[[File:Apollo-PSE.jpg|thumb|220px|right|The Apollo 11 seismometer, 1969.]]

=== Seismic vibrations ===

Seismometers on both ''Viking'' spacecraft were mounted on the lander, and picked up vibrations in 1976 from various operations of the lander and from the wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/54355/2/jgr82msapp.pdf|title=Signatures of Internally Generated Lander Vibrations|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|first=Don L.|last=Anderson|display-authors=etal|volume=82|issue=28|pages=4524–4546; A–2|date=September 1977|doi=10.1029/JS082i028p04524|bibcode=1977JGR....82.4524A}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''[[Viking 1]]'' lander's seismometer did not deploy properly and did not unlock; the locked seismometer could not operate.  

The Viking 2 seismometer did unlock, and was able to vibrate and return data to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast20jul_1/|title=Happy Anniversary, Viking Lander|publisher=NASA|work=Science@NASA|date=20 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lpi.usra.edu"&gt;https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2013/pdf/1178.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One problem was accounting for other data. On Sol 80, the Viking 2 seismometer detected an event.&lt;ref name="lpi.usra.edu"/&gt; No wind data were recorded at the same time, so it was not possible to determine whether the data indicated a seismic event or wind gust. Other lacking data would have been useful to rule out other sources of vibrations.&lt;ref name="lpi.usra.edu"/&gt; Two other problems were the location of the lander and that a certain level of wind on Mars caused a loss of sensitivity for the Viking 2 seismometer.&lt;ref name="lpi.usra.edu"/&gt; InSight has many other sensors, is placed directly on the surface, and also has a windshield.

Despite the difficulties, the Viking 2 seismometer readings were used to estimate a Martian geological [[Crust (geology)|crust]] thickness between {{convert|8.7|and|11.2|mi|km|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} at the ''Viking 2'' lander site.&lt;ref name=vikingspace/&gt; The ''Viking 2'' seismometer did detect vibrations from Mars winds complementing the meteorology results.&lt;ref name=vikingspace&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/18803-viking-2.html|title=Viking 2: Second Landing on Mars|work=Space.com|first=Elizabeth|last=Howell|date=6 December 2012|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Martian wind activity detected by a seismometer at Viking lander 2 site|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|last1=Nakamura|first1=Y.|last2=Anderson|first2=D.

=== Planetary nutation ===
Radio Doppler measurements were taken with ''Viking'' and twenty years later with ''[[Mars Pathfinder]]'', and in each case the [[Rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]] of Mars was estimated. By combining this data the core size was constrained, because the change in axis of rotation over 20 years allowed a [[precession]] rate and from that the planet's [[moment of inertia]] to be estimated.&lt;ref name="Banerdt20130307"&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/cs/groups/ssbsite/documents/webpage/ssb_086912.pdf|title=InSight: A Geophysical Mission to a Terrestrial Planet Interior |conference=Committee on Astrobiology and Planetary Science. 6–8 March 2013.

== Objectives ==
The ''InSight'' mission placed a single stationary lander on Mars to study its deep interior and address a fundamental issue of planetary and Solar System science: understanding the processes that shaped the [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planets]] of the inner Solar System (including Earth) more than four&amp;nbsp;billion years ago.&lt;ref name="missionpg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insight.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/ |title=InSight: Mission|publisher=NASA/[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]|access-date=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Terrestrial Planet Interiors (Earth, Mars and Moon) - Artist's Concept.jpg|thumb|right|Comparison of the interiors of Earth, Mars and the Moon (artist concept)]]

''InSight''{{'s}} primary objective is to study the earliest evolutionary processes that shaped Mars. By studying the size, thickness, density and overall structure of Mars' [[Planetary core|core]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] and [[Crust (geology)|crust]], as well as the rate at which heat escapes from the planet's interior, ''InSight'' will provide a glimpse into the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|evolutionary processes]] of all of the rocky planets in the inner Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panning|first1=Mark|last2=Lognonne|first2=Philippe|last3=Banerdt|first3=Bruce|display-authors=etal|title=Planned Products of the Mars Structure Service for the InSight Mission to Mars|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=October 2017|volume=211|issue=1–4|pages=611–650|doi=10.1007/s11214-016-0317-5|hdl=10044/1/48928|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01534998/file/Panning_21703.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="missionpg"/&gt; The rocky inner planets share a common ancestry that begins [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]]. As the body increases in size, its interior heats up and evolves to become a [[terrestrial planet]], containing a core, mantle and crust.&lt;ref name="ISScience"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insight.jpl.nasa.gov/science/|title=InSight: Science|publisher=NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory|access-date=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this common ancestry, each of the terrestrial planets is later shaped and molded through the poorly understood process of [[Planetary differentiation|differentiation]]. ''InSight'' mission's goal is to improve the understanding of this process and, by extension, terrestrial evolution, by measuring the planetary building blocks shaped by this differentiation: a terrestrial planet's core, mantle and crust.&lt;ref name="ISScience"/&gt;

The mission will determine if there is any [[Earthquake|seismic activity]], measure the rate of heat flow from the interior, estimate the size of Mars' [[Planetary core|core]] and whether the core is liquid or solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.universetoday.com/93843/nasas-proposed-insight-lander-would-peer-to-the-center-of-mars-in-2016/|title=NASAs Proposed 'InSight'Lander would Peer to the Center of Mars in 2016|work=Universe Today|first=Ken|last=Kremer|date=2 March 2012|access-date=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This data would be the first of its kind for Mars.&lt;ref name=bb13/&gt; It is also expected that frequent [[Air burst|meteor airbursts]] (10–200 detectable events per year for ''InSight'') will provide additional seismo-acoustic signals to probe the interior of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bolide Airbursts as a Seismic Source for the 2018 Mars InSight Mission|journal=Space Science Reviews|first1=J.|last1=Stevanović|first2=N.A.|last2=Teanby|first3=J.|last3=Wookey|first4=N.|last4=Selby|first5=I.

Measurements of crust thickness, mantle viscosity, core radius and density, and seismic activity should result in a three- to tenfold increase in accuracy compared to current data.&lt;ref name=bb13/&gt; This is the first time a robotic lander dug this deep into the martian crust.

In terms of fundamental processes shaping planetary formation, it is thought that Mars contains the most in-depth and accurate historical record, because it is big enough to have undergone the earliest [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] and internal heating processes that shaped the terrestrial planets, but is small enough to have retained signs of those processes.&lt;ref name="missionpg"/&gt; The science phase is expected to last for two years.&lt;ref name="nasa201208"/&gt;

After its launch from Earth on 5 May in 2018, it coasted through interplanetary space for 6.5 months traveling across {{convert|301|e6mi|e6km|order=flip|abbr=unit}} for a touchdown on the 26th November in that year.{{r|NYT-20180505|insight-launch}}

InSight cruise stage departed Earth at a speed of {{convert|10000|km/h}}.&lt;ref name="mars.nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/timeline/cruise|title=Cruise {{!}} Timeline|last=mars.nasa.gov |website=NASA's InSight Mars Lander|language=en|access-date=2018-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MarCo probes were ejected from the 2nd stage Centaur booster and traveled to Mars independent of the InSight cruise stage, but they were all launched together.

During the cruise to Mars, the InSight cruise stage made several course adjustments, and the first of these (TCM-1) took place on 22 May 2018.&lt;ref name="mars.nasa.gov"/&gt; The cruise stage that carries the lander includes solar panels, antenna, star trackers, [[sun sensor]], [[inertial measurement unit]] among its technologies.&lt;ref name="mars.nasa.gov"/&gt; The thrusters are actually on the ''InSight'' lander itself, but there are cutouts in the shell so the relevant rockets can vent into space.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/insight/launch/download/mars_insight_launch_presskit.pdf Mars InSight – May 2018 – Page 36]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entry, descent, and landing ===
On 26 November 2018, at approximately 19:53 UTC, mission controllers received a signal via the [[Mars Cube One]] (MarCO) satellites that the spacecraft had successfully touched down&lt;ref name="NYT-20181127"/&gt; at [[Elysium Planitia]].{{r|NYT-20180505|NYT-20181126|insight-launch}} After landing, the mission took three months to deploy and commission the geophysical science instruments.{{r|SurfaceOps|21Nov2018}} It  then began its mission of observing Mars, which is planned to last for two years.&lt;ref name="nasa201208"/&gt;

The spacecraft's mass that entered the atmosphere of Mars was {{convert|1340|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/timeline/landing/entry-descent-landing&lt;/ref&gt; There were  three major stages to InSight's landing:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/timeline/landing/entry-descent-landing|title=Entry, Descent, and Landing {{!}} Landing|last=mars.nasa.gov |website=NASA's InSight Mars Lander|language=en|access-date=2018-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Entry: after separating from the cruise stage the [[aeroshell]] enters the atmosphere and is subject to air and dust in the Martian atmosphere.
* Parachute descent: at a certain speed and altitude a [[parachute]] is deployed to slow the lander further.
* Rocket descent: closer to the ground the parachute is ejected and the lander uses rocket engines to slow the lander before touchdown.

Landing sequence:&lt;ref name="spaceflightnow.com"/&gt;
* 25 November 2018, final course correction before EDL.
* 26 November 2018, Cruise stage jettisoned before entering the atmosphere.
* Several minutes later, the aeroshell containing the lander makes contact with the upper Martian atmosphere at {{cvt|12300|mph}}.
** At this point it is {{convert|80|miles}} above Mars and in the next few minutes it lands, but undergoes many stages.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* Aeroshell is heated to {{cvt|1500|C|F}} during descent.
* At {{cvt|385|m/s}} and ~{{cvt|11100|m}} above the surface, the parachute is deployed.
* Several seconds later, the heat shield is jettisoned from the lander.
* The landing legs extended.
* Landing radar activated.
* Backshell jettisoned at a speed of about {{cvt|60|m/s}} and at {{cvt|1100|m}} altitude.
* Landing rockets turned on.
* Roughly {{cvt|50|m}} from the ground constant velocity mode is entered.
* Approaches ground at about {{cvt|5|mph}}.
* Touchdown{{mdash}}each of the three lander legs have a sensor to detect ground contact.
* Descent rockets are turned off at touchdown.
* Begin surface operations.

The lander's mass is about {{convert|358|kg|lb|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="press kit 2018"/&gt; but on Mars, which has 0.376 of Earth's&lt;ref name="universetoday.com"/&gt; gravity, it only weighs the equivalent of a {{convert|135|kg|lb|abbr=on}} object on Earth.

As ''InSight''{{'s}} science goals are not related to any particular surface feature of Mars, potential landing sites were chosen on the basis of practicality. Candidate sites needed to be near the [[equator]] of Mars to provide sufficient sunlight for the solar panels year round, have a low elevation to allow for sufficient atmospheric braking during [[Entry, descent and landing|EDL]], be flat and relatively rock-free to reduce the probability of complications during landing, and have soft enough terrain to allow the heat flow probe to penetrate well into the ground.

An optimal area that meets all these requirements is [[Elysium Planitia]], so all 22 initial potential landing sites were located in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/sciencefair/2013/09/04/mars-boring-landing/2764137/|title=NASA searches for (literally) boring Mars landing site|work=[[USA Today]]|last=Vergano|first=Dan|date=4 September 2013|access-date=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only two other areas on the equator and at low elevation, [[Isidis Planitia]] and [[Valles Marineris]], are too rocky. In addition, Valles Marineris has too steep a gradient to allow safe landing.&lt;ref name=landing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/insight/news/insight20130904.html|title=NASA Evaluates Four Candidate Sites for 2016 Mars Mission|publisher=NASA|date=4 September 2013|access-date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, the initial 22 potential landing sites were narrowed down to four, and the ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'' was then used to gain more information on each of the four potential sites before a final decision was made.{{r|landing}}&lt;ref name="Trget NBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/nasa-picks-prime-target-2016-insight-mars-lander-n317631|title=NASA Picks Prime Target for 2016 InSight Mars Lander|work=NBC News|last=Boyle|first=Alan|date=5 March 2015|access-date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each site consists of a [[landing footprint|landing ellipse]] that measures about {{convert|130|by|27|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/28793-nasa-insight-mars-lander-landing-site.html|title=NASA Eyeing Landing Site for 2016 Mars Mission|work=Space.com|last=Wall |first=Mike|date=11 March 2015|access-date=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, scientists from the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] announced that the landing site had been selected.

On 26 November 2018, NASA reported that the ''InSight'' lander had landed successfully on Mars. The meteorological suite ([[Temperature and Winds for InSight|TWINS]]) and magnetometer are operational, and the mission would take up to three months to deploy and commission the geophysical science instruments.&lt;ref name="SurfaceOps"/&gt;&lt;ref name="21Nov2018"&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA InSight Team on Course for Mars Touchdown|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7290|website=NASA/JPL|publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=1 September 2019|date=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After landing, the dust was allowed to settle for a few hours, during which time the solar array motors were warmed up and then the solar panels were unfurled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceref.com/mars/mars-insight-deploys-its-solar-panels.html|title=Mars InSight Deploys Its Solar Panels – SpaceRef|website=spaceref.com|access-date=2018-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name='surface-operations'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/timeline/surface-operations|title=Surface Operations {{!}} Timeline|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=NASA's InSight Mars Lander|language=en|access-date=2018-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lander then reported its systems' status, acquired some images, and it powered down to [[sleep mode]] for its first night on Mars.

On 7 December 2018, ''InSight'' recorded the sounds of Martian winds with SEIS, which is able to record vibrations within human hearing range, although rather low (aka subwoofer-type sounds), and these were sent back to Earth.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-insight-lander-hears-martian-winds|title=NASA InSight Lander 'Hears' Martian Winds|last=Brown|first=Katherine|date=7 December 2018|website=NASA|access-date=2018-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time the sound of Mars wind was heard after two previous attempts.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2019|reason=no mention of previous attempts to record sound on Mars}}

On 19 December 2018, the SEIS instrument was deployed onto the surface of Mars next to the lander by its robotic arm,&lt;ref name="NASA-20181219"/&gt; and it was commissioned on 4 February 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[https://spaceflightnow.com/2019/02/04/insight-lander-seis-enclosure/ InSight lander completes seismometer deployment on Mars.] Stephen Clark, ''Space Flight Now''. 4 February 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; After the seismometer became fully operational, the heat probe instrument was deployed on 12 February 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7335 NASA's InSight Prepares to Take Mars' Temperature.] Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA. 13 February 2019.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eetasia.com/news/article/19013102-taking-mars-vital-signs-with-ccd-image-sensors Taking Mars' Vital Signs with CCD Image Sensors].

On 28 February 2019, the Heat and Physical Properties Package probe (HP³) started digging into the surface of Mars. The probe and its digging mole were intended to reach a maximum depth of {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=unit}} after two months, but on 7 March 2019, the HP³ mole had only made it about {{convert|35|cm|in|abbr=unit}}, or three-quarters of the way out of its housing structure. Both NASA and DLR continue to look into the cause of the under-performing tool and for potential solutions. Scientifically useful measurements are possible at a depth of {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=unit}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Greicius |first1=Tony |title=More Testing for Mars InSight's 'Mole' |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/mars-insight-landers-mole-pauses-digging |website=NASA |accessdate=13 April 2020 |date=4 March 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2019, researchers reported that ''InSight'' uncovered unexplained [[Magnetic anomaly|magnetic pulses]], and [[Schumann resonances|magnetic oscillations]].&lt;ref name="NG-20190920"&gt;{{citenews |last=Andrews|first=Robin George|title=Mysterious magnetic pulses discovered on Mars - The nighttime events are among initial results from the InSight lander, which also found hints that the red planet may host a global reservoir of liquid water deep below the surface.|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/09/mars-insight-feels-mysterious-magnetic-pulsations-at-midnight/|date=20 September 2019 |work=[[National Geographic Society]]|accessdate=20 September 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2019, the researchers at JPL concluded that the soil on Mars does not provide necessary friction for drilling, causing the mole to bounce around and form a wide pit around itself rather than dig deeper. They attempted a maneuver called {{Em|pinning}} in which they pressed the side of the scoop against the mole location to pin the side of the wall of the hole and increase friction.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7511] Jet Propulsion Lab, NASA. 3 October 2019.&lt;/ref&gt; Pinning was initially successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7519|title=Mars InSight's 'Mole' Is Moving Again|website=NASA/JPL|access-date=2019-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then the mole backed out of its hole after a few weeks, suggesting the soil is accumulating below the mole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8529/mars-insights-mole-has-partially-backed-out-of-its-hole?site=insight|title=Mars InSight's Mole Has Partially Backed Out of Its Hole|last=mars.nasa.gov|website=NASA's InSight Mars Lander|language=en|access-date=2019-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNET-20191027"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kooser |first=Amanda |title=NASA InSight lander 'mole' suffers another Mars misfortune - NASA is trying to take Mars' temperature with a heat probe, but Mars isn't having it.|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/nasa-insight-lander-mole-suffers-another-mars-misfortune/ |date=27 October 2019|work=[[CNET]]|accessdate=28 October 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2020, the team reevaluated the risks of pushing the scoop directly against the back cap of the mole, and determined the procedure to be acceptable.

The [[Mars Cube One]] (MarCO) spacecraft are a pair of 6U [[CubeSat]]s that piggybacked with the ''InSight'' mission to test CubeSat navigation and endurance in deep space, and to help relay real-time communications (with an eight-minute lightspeed delay)&lt;ref name="21Nov2018" /&gt; during the probe's [[entry, descent and landing]] (EDL) phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/29374-nasa-cubesat-rocket-launch-system.html |title=NASA Wants New Rocket Rides for Tiny CubeSats |work=Space.com |last=Wall |first=Mike |date=12 May 2015 |access-date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.floridatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2015/05/16/nasa-seeks-launchers-smallest-satellites/27392049/ |title=NASA seeks launchers for smallest satellites |work=Florida Today |last=Dean |first=James |date=16 May 2015 |access-date=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two 6U CubeSats, named MarCO A and B, are identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/cubesats-rescue-180955544/?no-ist |title=CubeSats to the Rescue? |work=Smithsonian Air &amp; Space |last=Schulze-Makuch |first=Dirk |date=9 June 2015 |access-date=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were launched along with ''InSight'', but separated soon after reaching space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cubesat/missions/marco.php|title=JPL {{!}} Cubesat {{!}} MarCO|website=www.jpl.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they flew as a pair for redundancy while flanking the lander.&lt;ref name="Mars Cube One MarCO" /&gt; They did not enter orbit, but flew past Mars during the EDL phase of the mission and relayed ''InSight''{{'s}} telemetry in real time.&lt;ref name="MarCO"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/29489-marco-cubesats-mars-landing-2016.html |title=Two Tiny 'CubeSats' Will Watch 2016 Mars Landing |work=Space.com |last=Messier |first=Douglas |date=27 May 2015 |access-date=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MarCO JPL"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://marscubesatworkshop.jpl.nasa.gov/static/files/presentation/Asmar-Matousek/07-MarsCubeWorkshop-MarCO-update.pdf |title=Mars Cube One (MarCO) – The First Planetary CubeSat Mission |publisher=NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory |last=Asmar |first=Sami |last2=Matousek |first2=Steve |date=20 November 2014 |access-date=27 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125222036/https://marscubesatworkshop.jpl.nasa.gov/static/files/presentation/Asmar-Matousek/07-MarsCubeWorkshop-MarCO-update.pdf |archive-date=25 January 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the MarCO spacecraft proved the viability of the cubesat platform for deep space missions and helped serve as a technical demonstration for potential future missions of a similar nature.
