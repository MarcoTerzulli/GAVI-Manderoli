'''''Elixir''''' is the debut [[young adult fiction|young adult]] novel co-written by American entertainer [[Hilary Duff]] with Elise Allen. It was available at booksellers on October 12, 2010. It is the first in a series of books that Duff became committed to write. Elise Allen collaborated on the first book with Duff, and became committed to work jointly with her on the others. The book is now a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller]].

==Plot==
Clea Raymond is a talented photojournalist and the daughter of high-profile parents. Usually she’s in total control of her camera, but after Clea’s father disappears while on a humanitarian mission, eerie, shadowy images of a strange and handsome young man begin to appear in Clea’s photos—a man she has never seen in her life.

When Clea suddenly encounters this man in person she is stunned—and feels an immediate and powerful connection. As they grow closer, they are drawn deep into the mystery behind her father’s disappearance and discover the centuries-old truth behind their intense bond. Torn by a dangerous love triangle and haunted by a powerful secret that holds their fate, together they race against time to unravel their past in order to save their future—and their lives.

==Creation process==
Duff said, in an interview she gave to ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen Magazine]]'' about the creation of ''Elixir,'' "I have been playing with the idea for a few years now. It's a lot of fun and at the same time, very challenging." Duff informed the magazine that she had had the idea in her mind for a long time, first with a series of short scripts, but then, following encouragement from her mother, she decided to convert the concept into a book, recruiting Elise Allen to assist her with the writing.

About the paranormal aspect of ''Elixir,'' Duff remarked: "I have always been interested in the paranormal and afterlife, everything from ghosts to angels. I think that everyone has that curiosity of the great unknown."

==Reviews==
''[[Star Magazine]]'' gave ''Elixir'' 3 out of 4 stars, being positively surprised with Duff's writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twitpic.com/2txgyu/full |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014060100/http://twitpic.com/2txgyu/full |archivedate=October 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Post]]'' wrote, "It has everything: romance and the supernatural; a globe-trotting Hillary Clinton-esque mom; characters with names like Sage and Clea...and a shout-out to [[Page Six]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/books/in_my_library_hilary_duff_itJT5d4pFd4sTp1GsnN7bI |title=In my library: Hilary Duff - NYpost.com |work=New York Post |date=October 9, 2010 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020182307/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/books/in_my_library_hilary_duff_itJT5d4pFd4sTp1GsnN7bI |archivedate=October 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MTV]]'s Book Report gave ''Elixir'' a very positive review, saying it was ready for "another dose" of ''Elixir''. [[MTV]] also said that ''"Elixir'' is crying out for a movie adaptation" and suggested that maybe [[Hilary Duff]] herself should take the main role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://hollywoodcrush.mtv.com/2010/10/12/hilary-duff-elixir-review/ |title=Hilary Duff's 'Elixir' Is Good Medicine: The Book Report |publisher=Hollywoodcrush.mtv.com |date=2010-10-12 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Elixir'' also reached the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|New York Times' Best Sellers List]] at #10 in Children's Chapter Books for one week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2010-10-31/chapter-books/list.html |title='Elixir' Is A New York Times' Best Seller! - NYTimes.com | work=The New York Times | first=Jennifer |last=Schuessler|accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels==
Duff had already stated multiple times that she would write a couple of sequels to ''Elixir,'' all in collaboration with Allen. In an interview with ''[[Cosmogirl|CosmoGirl! Magazine]],'' she said: "Clea has been on an emotional rollercoaster, so that is probably where the next book will start. Clea will need to find a way to pick herself up and put the pieces of her life back together. Who knows how long that could take? And what her next move will be? Hopefully her dreams will guide her. IF she can dream."
But she had said that she had not set anything in stone as yet and that she and her co-writer, Allen, were simply playing around with different ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nunez |first=Alanna |url=http://www.seventeen.com/cosmogirl/h...ixir-interview |title=Celebrity Interviews 2015 - Hottest Celebrity Pics &amp; News |publisher=Seventeen.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-20 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duff teased on Twitter about a sequel: "Can’t believe so many people have read the book already!

A sequel, titled ''[[Devoted]]'', hit book shelves on October 11, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/unset0000unse_j2q5|title=Devoted|work=Hilary Duff|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster.com|accessdate=2015-06-20|isbn=9781442408555|date=2011-10-11|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duff announced in July 2012 that the third and final novel in the ''Elixir'' series would be titled ''True''. The book was released on April 16, 2013 by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]."&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite book |author=Elixir Trailer |url=https://archive.org/details/trueelixirnovel0000duff |title=True &amp;#124; Book by Hilary Duff &amp;#124; Official Publisher Page &amp;#124; Simon &amp; Schuster |publisher=Books.simonandschuster.com |date=2013-04-16 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |isbn=9781442408579 |url-access=registration }}&lt;/ref&gt;
