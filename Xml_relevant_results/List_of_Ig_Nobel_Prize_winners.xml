This is a '''list of Ig Nobel Prize winners''' from 1991 to the present day.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.improbable.com/ig-about/winners/|title=The Ig Nobel Prize Winners|date=1 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[parody]] of the [[Nobel Prize]]s, the [[Ig Nobel Prize]]s are awarded each year in mid-September, around the time the recipients of the genuine Nobel Prizes are announced, for ten achievements that "first make people laugh, and then make them think". Commenting on the 2006 awards, [[Marc Abrahams]], editor of ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'' and co-sponsor of the awards, said that "[t]he prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual, honor the imaginative, and spur people's interest in science, medicine, and technology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5411816.stm |work=BBC News |title=Teen repellent is Ig Nobel winner |date=6 October 2006 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All prizes are awarded for real achievements, except for three in 1991 and one in 1994, due to an erroneous press release.

===No longer officially listed===
* '''Physics''' – Presented to The [[Japanese Meteorological Agency]], for its seven-year study of whether earthquakes are caused by [[Namazu (Japanese mythology)|catfish]] wiggling their tails. This winner is not officially listed, as it was based on what turned out to be erroneous press accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.improbable.com/2014/05/17/inspired-by-the-possibility-that-catfish-caused-earthquakes/ |title=Inspired by the possibility that catfish caused earthquakes |author=Improbable Research |date=17 May 2014 |website=improbable.com |access-date=26 October 2016 |quote=However… we later discovered that the documentation for that was suspect.

However, the U.S. government refused to allow him into the country. His friend Madhu Kapoor therefore came to the Ig Nobel Ceremony and accepted the Prize on behalf of Lal Bihari. Several weeks later, the Prize was presented to Lal Bihari himself in a special ceremony in India.

:It has been suggested that the study of this phenomenon has had major political consequences. Following the [[Soviet submarine S-363|sensational stranding of a Soviet submarine]] deep inside Swedish waters on 27 October 1981, the Swedish navy initiated a large-scale campaign to guard Swedish territorial waters from the perceived threat of infiltration by foreign submarines, despite [[Soviet Union|the Soviets]] consistently asserting that the stranding had occurred due to navigational errors. The [[Swedish submarine incidents|"submarine hunts"]], which lasted throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, have been a heavily debated issue in Sweden, as to whether or not there ever was any factual substance to the claims of Soviet infiltration. One widely reported piece of "evidence" were several sound recordings of what the Swedish navy suspected to be foreign submarines. Oceanographers and marine biologists were invited to study the recordings and would eventually find that the sounds heard were most probably produced not by submarines, but in fact were the noises made when herring passed gas. In a reportage by the Swedish science magazine ''"Vetenskapens värld"'' ("World of science") televised on 16 April 2012, it's suggested that these findings were important in putting an end to the costly "submarine hunts" which had continued for more than a decade, with Ig Nobel laurate Håkan Westerberg guessing that this would have saved Swedish tax payers hundreds of millions in [[Swedish krona|SEK]].&lt;ref name=Staff&gt;Aired 16 April 2012.
