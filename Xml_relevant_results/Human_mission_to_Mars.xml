A '''human mission to Mars''' has been the subject of [[science fiction]], [[aerospace engineering]] and scientific proposals since the 20th century. Plans include landing on [[Mars]] for exploration at a minimum, with the possibility of [[Colonization of Mars|sending settlers]] and [[Terraforming of Mars|terraforming the planet]] or exploring its moons [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] also considered.{{citation_needed|date=June 2019}}

The [[exploration of Mars]] has been a goal of national space programs for decades. Conceptual work for missions that would involve [[human spaceflight|human explorers]] has been ongoing since the 1950s, with planned missions typically being stated as taking place anywhere between 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted.&lt;ref name="SPC-20190827" /&gt; The [[list of crewed Mars mission plans]] shows the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and [[space agency|space agencies]] in this field of [[space exploration]]. Plans have varied from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between two and eight [[astronauts]]) would visit Mars for a period of a few weeks or year, to the permanent [[colonization of Mars]].{{citation_needed|date=April 2019}}

In the 2010s, numerous US, European, and Asian agencies were developing proposals for human missions to Mars.{{citation_needed|date=June 2019}} [[Mars in fiction|In fiction]], Mars is a frequent target of exploration and settlement in books, graphic novels, and [[List of films set on Mars|films]].

== Travel to Mars ==
[[File:Mars close appr.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The minimum distance between the orbits of Mars and Earth from 2014 to 2061, measured in [[astronomical units]]]]
[[File:Hubble Globes of Mars.jpg|thumb|Three views of Mars, [[Hubble Space Telescope]], 1997]]
The energy needed for transfer between planetary orbits, or "[[Delta-v]]", is lowest at intervals fixed by the [[synodic period]]. For Earth / Mars trips, this is every 26 months (2 years and 2 months), so missions are typically planned to coincide with one of these [[launch window]]s. Due to the eccentricity of Mars' orbit, the energy needed in the low-energy windows varies on roughly a 15-year cycle&lt;ref name="portree2001" /&gt; with the easiest windows needing only half the energy of the peaks.&lt;ref name="portree2001window"&gt;Page 18-19 in Chapter 3 of David S. F. Portree's ''Humans to Mars: Fifty Years of Mission Planning, 1950–2000,'' NASA Monographs in Aerospace History Series, Number 21, February 2001. Available as [https://history.nasa.gov/monograph21/humans_to_Mars.htm NASA SP-2001-4521]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, there was a minimum in the 1969 and 1971 launch windows and another low in 1986 and 1988, then the cycle repeated.&lt;ref name="portree2001" /&gt; The next low-energy launch window occurs in 2033.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mission design options for human Mars missions|author=Paul D. Wooster|display-authors=etal|citeseerx = 10.1.1.524.7644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several types of mission plans have been proposed, including opposition class and conjunction class&lt;ref name="portree2001window" /&gt; or the [[Crocco Grand Tour|Crocco flyby]].&lt;ref name="portree2001flyby"&gt;Page 15-16 in Chapter 3 of David S. F. Portree's ''Humans to Mars: Fifty Years of Mission Planning, 1950–2000,'' NASA Monographs in Aerospace History Series, Number 21, February 2001. Available as [https://history.nasa.gov/monograph21/humans_to_Mars.htm NASA SP-2001-4521]&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest energy transfer to Mars is a [[Hohmann transfer orbit]], which would involve an approximately 9 month travel time from Earth to Mars, about five hundred days at Mars to wait for the transfer window to Earth, and a travel time of about 9 months to return to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/multimedia/space-images/charts/hohmann-transfer-orbit.html|title=Hohmann transfer orbit diagram|website=Planetary.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMAT6680Fa05/Bacon/hohmanntransfers.html|title=Homann Transfers|website=Jwilson.coe.uga.edu|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shorter Mars mission plans have round-trip flight times of 400 to 450 days,&lt;ref name=vonBraun&gt;Werner von Braun,  {{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |title=Popular Science |work=google.com |date=March 1964 |accessdate=12 June 2015|publisher=Bonnier Corporation }}&lt;/ref&gt; but would require significantly higher energy. A fast Mars mission of 245 days round trip could be possible with on-orbit staging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/marsconcepts2012/pdf/4181.pdf|title=Folta, et al. - FAST MARS TRANSFERS THROUGH ON-ORBIT STAGING. (2012)|website=Usra.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 [[ballistic capture]] was proposed, which may reduce fuel cost and provide more flexible launch windows compared to the Hohmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://io9.com/making-a-trip-to-mars-cheaper-easier-the-case-for-ba-1675796166
 |title=Making A Trip To Mars Cheaper &amp; Easier: The Case For Ballistic Capture
 |author=Matt Williams – Universe Today |work=io9 |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Crocco grand tour, a crewed spacecraft would get a flyby of Mars and Venus in under a year in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tdf.it/2006/2/crocco_en.htm|title=Crocco|website=Tdf.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some flyby mission architectures can also be extended to include a style of Mars landing with a flyby excursion lander spacecraft.&lt;ref name="wired.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/01/to-mars-by-flyby-landing-excursion-mode-flem-1966/|title=To Mars by Flyby-Landing Excursion Mode (FLEM) (1966)|website=Wired.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed by R. Titus in 1966, it involved a short stay lander-ascent vehicle that would separate from a "parent" Earth-Mars transfer craft prior to its flyby of Mars. The Ascent-Descent lander would arrive sooner and either go into orbit around Mars or land, and depending on the design offer perhaps 10–30 days before it needed to launch itself back to the main transfer vehicle.&lt;ref name="wired.com" /&gt; (see also [[Mars flyby]]).

[[Aerobraking]] at Mars was estimated in the 1980s to cut the mass of a Mars mission lifting off from Earth by half.&lt;ref name="spaceflight.nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/exploration/marsexploration/html/s88_35629.html|title=Photo-s88_35629|website=Spaceflight.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Mars missions have designed interplanetary spacecraft and landers capable of aero-braking.&lt;ref name="spaceflight.nasa.gov"/&gt;

==Landing on Mars==
[[File:S91 25383marslanding.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Insets depict observation and analysis to find a safe landing site]]
Landed spacecraft on the surface of Mars:
* ''[[Mars 3]]''
* ''[[Viking 1]]'' and ''[[Viking 2]]''
* ''[[Mars Pathfinder]]'' and its [[Sojourner (rover)|''Sojourner'' rover]]
* ''[[Spirit (rover)|Spirit]]'' and ''[[Opportunity (rover)|Opportunity]]'' rovers
* ''[[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]]'' lander
* ''[[Curiosity (rover)|Curiosity]]'' rover
* ''[[InSight]]'' lander

===Orbital capture===
When an expedition reaches Mars, braking is required to enter orbit. Two options are available: rockets or [[aerocapture]]. Aerocapture at Mars for human missions was studied in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="ntrs.nasa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20050207380.pdf|format=PDF|title=A Comparative Study of Aerocapture Missions with a Mars Destination|author1=Diane Vaughan|author2=Bonnie F. James|author3=Michelle M. Murk|website=Ntrs.nasa.gov|accessdate=16 March 2019}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of 93 Mars studies, 24 used aerocapture for Mars or Earth return.&lt;ref name="ntrs.nasa.gov"/&gt; One of the considerations for using aerocapture on crewed missions is a limit on the maximum force experienced by the astronauts. The current scientific consensus is that 5g, or 5 times Earth gravity, is the maximum allowable acceleration.&lt;ref name="ntrs.nasa.gov"/&gt;

===Survey work===
Conducting a safe landing requires knowledge of the properties of the atmosphere, first observed by [[Mariner 4]], and a survey of the planet to identify suitable landing sites. Major global surveys were conducted by [[Mariner 9]] and ''[[Viking 1]]'' and two orbiters, which supported the Viking landers. Later orbiters, such as ''[[Mars Global Surveyor]]'', ''[[2001 Mars Odyssey]]'', ''[[Mars Express]]'', and ''[[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]]'', have mapped Mars in higher resolution with improved instruments. These later surveys have identified the probable locations of water, a critical resource.{{citation_needed|date=June 2019}}

===Funding===
The largest limiting factor for sending humans to Mars is funding. The estimated cost is roughly 500 billion U.S. dollars, though the actual costs are likely to be more.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Scientific Exploration of Mars |last=Taylor |first=Fredric |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-521-82956-4 |location=Cambridge |pages=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the late 1950s, the early phase of space exploration was conducted as much to make a political statement as to make observations of the solar system. However, this proved to be both wasteful and unsustainable, and the current climate is one of international cooperation, with large projects such as the [[International Space Station]] and the proposed [[Lunar Gateway]] being built and launched by multiple countries.{{citation_needed|date=June 2019}}

Critics argue that the immediate benefits of establishing a human presence on Mars are outweighed by the immense cost, and that funds could be better redirected towards other programs, such as robotic exploration. Proponents of human space exploration contend that the symbolism of establishing a presence in space may garner public interest to join the cause and spark global cooperation. There are also claims that a long-term investment in space travel is necessary for humanity's survival.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Main|List of crewed Mars mission plans}}

Over the past seven decades, a wide variety of [[Spaceflight mission architecture|mission architectures]] have been proposed or studied for human spaceflights to Mars. These have included [[Chemical rocket|chemical]], [[nuclear thermal propulsion|nuclear]] and [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric]] [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]], as well as a wide variety of landing, living, and return methodologies.

Over the last century, a number of mission concepts for such an expedition have been proposed. David Portree's history volume ''Humans to Mars: Fifty Years of Mission Planning, 1950–2000'' discusses many of these.&lt;ref name="portree2001"&gt;David S. F.

==== Wernher von Braun proposal (1947 through 1950s) ====
[[Wernher von Braun]] was the first person to make a detailed technical study of a Mars mission.&lt;ref name="portree2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="platoff"&gt;Annie Platoff, ''Eyes on the Red Planet: Human Mars Mission Planning, 1952–1970,'' (1999); available as [http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/CR-2001-208928.pdf NASA/CR-2001-2089280] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531192655/http://ston.jsc.nasa.gov/collections/TRS/_techrep/CR-2001-208928.pdf |date=2010-05-31 }} (July 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Details were published in his book ''Das Marsprojekt'' (1952, published in English as ''[[The Mars Project]]'' in 1962&lt;ref&gt;Wernher von Braun, ''[[The Mars Project]],'' University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;) and several subsequent works.&lt;ref&gt;Wernher von Braun, "The Next 20 Years of Interplanetary Exploration," ''Astronautics &amp; Aeronautics,'' November 1965, pp 24-34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Willy Ley]] popularized a similar mission in English in the book ''[[The Conquest of Space]]'' (1949), featuring illustrations by [[Chesley Bonestell]]. Von Braun's Mars project envisioned nearly a thousand three-stage vehicles launching from Earth to ferry parts for the Mars mission to be constructed at a space station in Earth orbit.&lt;ref name="platoff" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Wade, [http://www.astronautix.com/craft/vonn1952.htm Von Braun Mars Expedition – 1952] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116233913/http://astronautix.com/craft/vonn1952.htm |date=2010-01-16 }}, in [http://www.astronautix.com/ Encyclopedia Astronautica]&lt;/ref&gt; The mission itself featured a fleet of ten spacecraft with a combined crew of 70 heading to Mars, bringing three winged surface excursion ships that would land horizontally on the surface of Mars. (Winged landing was considered possible because at the time of his proposal, the Martian atmosphere was believed to be much denser than was later found to be the case.)

In the 1956 revised vision of the Mars Project plan, published in the book ''The Exploration of Mars'' by Wernher Von Braun and Willy Ley, the size of the mission was trimmed, requiring only 400 launches to put together two ships, still carrying a winged landing vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/vonn1956.htm |title=Von Braun Mars Expedition – 1956 |work=astronautix.com |accessdate=12 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116234605/http://astronautix.com/craft/vonn1956.htm |archivedate=16 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions of the mission proposal, featured in the [[Disney]] "Man In Space" film series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/disney_article.html|title=Article on Von Braun and Walt Disney|website=History.msfc.nasa.gov|accessdate=16 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211155223/https://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/disney_article.html|archive-date=11 February 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed [[nuclear power|nuclear-powered]] [[ion propulsion|ion-propulsion]] vehicles for the interplanetary cruise.

==== U.S. proposals (1950s to 1970s) ====
[[File:Mars Excursion Module.jpg|thumb|Artist's conception of the [[Mars Excursion Module]] (MEM) proposed in a NASA study in 1963. Crew wear [[Mars suit]]s on surface EVA from the module.]]
From 1957 to 1965, work was done by [[General Atomics]] on [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]], a proposal for a [[nuclear pulse propulsion]] spacecraft. Orion was intended to have the ability to transport extremely large payloads compared to chemical rocketry, making crewed missions to Mars and the outer planets feasible. One of the early vehicle designs was intended to send an 800-ton payload to Mars orbit. The [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]] of 1963 made further development unviable, and work ended in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dyson |first1=George |title=Project Orion: The Atomic Spaceship 1957-1965 |date=2002 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-140-27732-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Aeronutronic Ford,&lt;ref name="dixon"&gt;Franklin Dixon, "Summary Presentation: Study of a Manned Mars Excursion Module," in ''Proceedings of the Symposium on Manned Planetary Missions: 1963/1964 Status'', NASA TM X-53049 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; General Dynamics and the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company made studies of Mars mission designs as part of NASA Marshall Spaceflight Center "Project EMPIRE".&lt;ref name="platoff" /&gt; These studies indicated that a Mars mission (possibly including a Venus fly-by) could be done with a launch of eight [[Saturn V]] boosters and assembly in low Earth orbit, or possibly with a single launch of a hypothetical "post Saturn" heavy-lift vehicle. Although the EMPIRE missions were never proposed for funding, they were the first detailed analyses of what it would take to accomplish a human voyage to Mars using data from actual NASA spaceflight, laying the basis for future studies, including significant mission studies by TRW, North American, Philco, Lockheed, Douglas, and General Dynamics, along with several in-house NASA studies.&lt;ref name="platoff" /&gt;

Following the success of the [[Apollo Program]], von Braun advocated a crewed mission to Mars as a focus for NASA's crewed space program.&lt;ref&gt;Wernher von Braun, "Manned Mars Landing Presentation to the Space Task Group," presentation materials, August 1969 (referenced by Portree'', 2001 op cit''.&lt;/ref&gt; Von Braun's proposal used [[Saturn V]] boosters to launch [[NERVA]]-powered upper stages that would propel two six-crew spacecraft on a dual mission in the early 1980s. The proposal was considered by President [[Richard Nixon]] but passed over in favor of the [[Space Shuttle]].

In 1975, von Braun discussed the mission architecture that emerged from these Apollo-era studies in a recorded lecture and while doing so suggested that multiple [[Space Shuttle|Shuttle]] launches could instead be configured to lift the two Nuclear Thermal Rocket engine equipped spacecraft in smaller parts, for assembly in-orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPYYw8Qcy-o&amp;t=5m47s|title=Von Braun about Mars.wmv|last=Artemis Westenberg|date=15 July 2012|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Soviet mission proposals (1956 through 1969) ====
{{Main|Martian Piloted Complex|TMK}}
The [[Martian Piloted Complex]] or "'MPK'" was a proposal by [[Mikhail Tikhonravov]] of the Soviet Union for a crewed Mars expedition, using the (then proposed) N1 rocket, in studies from 1956 to 1962. The Soviets sent many probes to Mars with some noted success stories including Mars atmospheric entry, but the overall rate of success was low.{{citation_needed|date=June 2019}} (see [[Mars 3]])

[[TMK|Heavy Interplanetary Spacecraft]] (known by the Russian acronym '''TMK''') was the designation of a Soviet Union space exploration proposal in the 1960s to send a crewed flight to Mars and Venus (TMK-MAVR design) without landing. The TMK spacecraft was due to launch in 1971 and make a three-year-long flight including a Mars fly-by at which time probes would have been dropped. The project was never completed because the required [[N1 rocket]] never flew successfully. The ''Mars Expeditionary Complex'', or "'MEK"' (1969) was another Soviet proposal for a Mars expedition that would take a crew from three to six to Mars and back with a total mission duration of 630 days.

==== Case for Mars (1981–1996) ====
Following the [[Viking program|Viking]] missions to Mars, between 1981 and 1996 a series of conferences named The Case for Mars were held at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. These conferences advocated human exploration of Mars, presented concepts and technologies, and held a series of workshops to develop a baseline concept for the mission. It proposed use of [[in-situ resource utilization]] to manufacture rocket propellant for the return trip. The mission study was published in a series of proceedings volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope J. Boston, ed., ''AAS Science and Technology Series Volume 57, Proceedings of the Case for Mars I'', 1984 (second printing 1987),  {{ISBN|0-87703-197-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher P.

Hard cover: {{ISBN|0-87703-219-X}}, Soft cover: {{ISBN|0-87703-220-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later conferences presented alternative concepts, including the "Mars Direct" concept of [[Robert Zubrin]] and David Baker; the "Footsteps to Mars" proposal of [[Geoffrey A. Landis]],&lt;ref name="footstepstomars"&gt;Geoffrey A. Landis, "Footsteps to Mars: an Incremental Approach to Mars Exploration," ''Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, Vol. 48,'' pp. 367-342 (1995); presented at Case for Mars V, Boulder CO, 26–29 May 1993; appears in ''From Imagination to Reality: Mars Exploration Studies'', R. Zubrin, ed., ''AAS Science and Technology Series Volume 91'' pp. 339-350 (1997). (text available as [http://www.sff.net/people/Geoffrey.Landis/Footsteps.pdf Footsteps to Mars pdf file]&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed intermediate steps before the landing on Mars, including human missions to Phobos; and the "Great Exploration" proposal from [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], among others.

==== NASA Space Exploration Initiative (1989) ====
{{Main|Space Exploration Initiative}}
[[File:Mars mission.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's conception of a human mission on the surface of Mars&lt;br /&gt;(1989 painting by Les Bossinas of [[Lewis Research Center]] for NASA)]]
In response to a presidential initiative, NASA made a study of a project for human lunar- and Mars exploration as a proposed follow-on to the [[International Space Station]]. This resulted in a report, called the ''90-day study'',&lt;ref&gt;NASA, ''Report of the 90-day study on human exploration of the Moon and Mars'', published 11/1989; [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989STIN...9127055. abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the agency proposed a long-term plan consisting of completing the Space Station as "a critical next step in all our space endeavors," returning to the Moon and establishing a permanent base, and then sending astronauts to Mars. This report was widely criticized as too elaborate and expensive, and all funding for human exploration beyond Earth orbit was canceled by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Dwayne Day, "Aiming for Mars, grounded on Earth," ''The Space Review'' February 16, 2004 [http://www.thespacereview.com/article/102/1 link]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mars Direct (early 1990s) ====
{{Main|Mars Direct}}
Because of the greater distance, the Mars mission would be much more risky and expensive than past Moon flights. Supplies and fuel would have to be prepared for a 2-3 year round trip and the spacecraft would need at least partial shielding from ionizing radiation. A 1990 paper by [[Robert Zubrin]] and David A. Baker, then of [[Martin Marietta]], proposed reducing the mission mass (and hence the cost) by using [[in situ resource utilization#Mars|in situ resource utilization]] to manufacture propellant from the Martian Atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Zubrin, D. A. Baker and O. Gwynne, "Mars Direct: A Simple, Robust, and Cost Effective Architecture for the Space Exploration Initiative," paper AAS 90-168, in ''The Case for Mars IV: The International Exploration of Mars, Part I, MISSION STRATEGY &amp; ARCHITECTURES,'' AAS Science and Technology Series Volume 89, Proceedings of the Case for Mars Conference, ed. Thomas R. Meyer, 1997 ({{ISBN|0-87703-418-4}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Zubrin and D. A. Baker, "Mars Direct: Humans to the Red Planet by 1999," 41st Congress of the [[International Astronautical Federation]] (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal drew on concepts developed by the former "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080621011517/http://spot.colorado.edu/~marscase/Home.html Case for Mars]" conference series. Over the next decade, Zubrin developed it into a mission concept, [[Mars Direct]], which he presented in a book, ''[[The Case for Mars]]'' (1996). The mission is advocated by the [[Mars Society]], which Zubrin founded in 1998, as practical and affordable.

==== International Space University (1991) ====
In 1991 in Toulouse, France, the International Space University studied an international human Mars mission.&lt;ref name=mendell&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/HumanExplore/Exploration/EXLibrary/Docs/EIC036.HTML|title=ISU Manned Mars Mission|date=19 April 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419185049/http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/HumanExplore/Exploration/EXLibrary/Docs/EIC036.HTML|archivedate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They proposed a crew of 8 traveling to Mars in a nuclear-powered vessel with artificial gravity provided by rotation.&lt;ref name=mendell /&gt; On the surface, 40 tonne habitats pressurized to {{convert|10|psi|abbr=on}} were powered by a 40&amp;nbsp;kW photovoltaic array.&lt;ref name=mendell /&gt;

The idea of a one-way trip to Mars has been proposed several times. In 1988, space activist Bruce Mackenzie proposed a one-way trip to Mars in a presentation at the [[International Space Development Conference]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Mackenzie, One Way to Mars – a Permanent Settlement on the First Mission," presented at the 1998 International Space Development Conference, May 21–25, Milwaukee WI; [http://archivist.nss.org/Public/ISDC/ISDC1999_Houston/ConferenceMisc-DaleAmonPapers/ISDC99-Abstracts_CD/AIAA%20Abstracts/One%20Way%20to%20Mars.pdf Abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113111102/http://archivist.nss.org/Public/ISDC/ISDC1999_Houston/ConferenceMisc-DaleAmonPapers/ISDC99-Abstracts_CD/AIAA%20Abstracts/One%20Way%20to%20Mars.pdf |date=2013-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the mission could be done with less difficulty and expense without a return to Earth. In 2006, former NASA engineer James C. McLane III proposed a scheme to initially colonize Mars via a one-way trip by only one human. Papers discussing this concept appeared in ''[[The Space Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;James C. McLane III, "Spirit of the Lone Eagle": an audacious program for a manned Mars landing, ''The Space Review'' July 31, 2006 [http://www.thespacereview.com/article/669/1 link]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;James C.

====Mars orbit by the mid-2030s (2010)====
In a [[Barack Obama space policy speech at Kennedy Space Center|major space policy speech]] at Kennedy Space Center on 15 April 2010, [[Barack Obama]] predicted a crewed Mars mission to orbit the planet by the mid-2030s, followed by a landing. This proposal was mostly supported by Congress, which approved cancelling [[Project Constellation]] in favor of a 2025 [[Asteroid Redirect Mission]] and orbiting Mars in the 2030s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/09/congress-mostly-approves-new.html |title=Congress Mostly Approves New Direction for NASA |work=sciencemag.org |accessdate=12 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513234741/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2010/09/congress-mostly-approves-new.html |archivedate=13 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Asteroid Redirect Mission was cancelled in June 2017 and "closed out" in September of the same year.{{citation_needed|date=June 2019}}

==== Russian mission proposals (2011) ====
A number of Mars mission concepts and proposals have been put forth by [[Russia]]n scientists. Stated dates were for a launch sometime between 2016 and 2020. The Mars probe would carry a crew of four to five cosmonauts, who would spend close to two years in space.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In late 2011, Russian and European space agencies successfully completed the ground-based [[MARS-500]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rian.ru/science/20090714/155522543.html |title=Mars-500 crew report good health after experiment |author=Sputnik |date=14 July 2009 |work=rian.ru |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biomedical experiment simulating crewed flight to Mars was completed in Russia in July 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/spacecraft_manned_mars.html|title=Russia's plans for manned Mars missions|website=Russianspaceweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2-4-2 concept (2011–2012) ====
In 2012, Jean-Marc Salotti published a new proposal for a crewed Mars mission. The '2-4-2' concept is based on a reduction of the crew size to 2 astronauts and the duplication of the entire mission. There are 2 astronauts in each space vehicle, there are 4 on the surface of Mars and there are 2 once again in each return vehicle. If one set of hardware runs into trouble, there are 2 astronauts ready to help the 2 others (2 for 2). This architecture simplifies the entry, descent and landing procedures by reducing the size of the landing vehicles. It also avoids the assembly of huge vehicles in LEO. The author claims that his proposal is much cheaper than the NASA reference mission without compromising the risks and can be undertaken before 2030.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marc Salotti, Acta Astronautica, Volume 69, Issues 5–6, September–October 2011, Pages 266–279.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Marc Salotti, Acta Astronautica, Volume 81, Issue 1, December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Boeing Conceptual Space Vehicle Architecture (2012) ====
In 2012, a conceptual architecture was published by [[Boeing]], [[United Launch Alliance]], and RAL Space in Britain, laying out a possible design for a crewed Mars mission. Components of the architecture include various spacecraft for the Earth-to-Mars journey, landing, and surface stay as well as return. Some features include several uncrewed cargo landers assembled into a base on the surface of Mars. The crew would land at this base in the "Mars Personnel Lander", which could also take them back into Mars orbit. The design for the crewed interplanetary spacecraft included artificial gravity and an artificial magnetic field for radiation protection. Overall, the architecture was modular to allow for incremental R&amp;D.&lt;ref name=mars&gt;{{Cite book |title= Conceptual Space Vehicle Architecture for Human Exploration of Mars, with Artificial Gravity and Mini-Magnetosphere Crew Radiation Shield |doi= 10.2514/6.2012-5114|year = 2012|last1 = Benton|first1 = Mark|last2=Kutter |first2=Bernard |last3=Bamford |first3=Ruth |last4=Bingham |first4=Bob |last5=Todd |first5=Tom |last6=Stafford-Allen |first6=Robin |isbn=978-1-60086-940-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial concept included an orbiter and small robotic lander in 2018, followed by a rover in 2020, and the base components in 2024.&lt;ref name=adario /&gt; The first crew of four astronauts were to land on Mars in 2025. Then, every two years, a new crew of four would arrive. Financing was intended to come from selling the broadcasting rights of the entire training and of the flight as a [[reality television]] show, and that money would be used to contract for all hardware and launch services. In April 2015, Mars One's CEO Bas Lansdorp admitted that their 12-year plan for landing humans on Mars by 2027 is "mostly fiction".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iflscience.com/space/mars-one-torn-shreds-mit-debate Mars One Torn To Shreds In MIT Debate].

==== NASA Moon to Mars (2017-) ====
{{update section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Sls block1 on-pad sunrisesmall.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's rendering of SLS Block 1/Orion]]
On October 8, 2015, NASA published its strategy for human exploration and colonization of Mars. The concept operates through three distinct phases leading up to fully sustained colonization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=NASA Releases Plan Outlining Next Steps in the Journey to Mars |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-releases-plan-outlining-next-steps-in-the-journey-to-mars |website=NASA |accessdate=2015-10-12 |first=Erin |last=Mahoney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stage, already underway, is the "Earth Reliant" phase. This phase continues using the [[International Space Station]] until 2024; validating deep space technologies and studying the effects of long duration space missions on the human body.

The second stage, "Proving Ground," moves away from Earth reliance and ventures into [[cislunar space]] for most of its tasks. The proposed [[Lunar Gateway]] would test deep space habitation facilities, and validate capabilities required for human exploration of Mars.

Finally, phase three is the transition to independence from Earth resources. The "Earth Independent" phase includes long term missions on the lunar surface with surface habitats that only require routine maintenance, and the harvesting of Martian resources for fuel, water, and building materials. NASA is still aiming for human missions to Mars in the 2030s, though Earth independence could take decades longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/journey-to-mars-next-steps-20151008_508.pdf

A number of nations and organizations have long-term intentions to send humans to Mars.
* The [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] has several robotic missions currently exploring Mars, with a sample-return planned for the future. The [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle]] (MPCV) is intended to serve as the launch/splashdown crew delivery vehicle, with a [[Deep Space Habitat]] module providing additional living-space for the 16-month-long journey.

== Technological innovations and hurdles ==
[[File:Mars Food Production - Bisected.jpg|thumb|Depiction of plants growing in a Mars base. NASA plans to grow plants for [[space food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/meals_ready_to_eat|title=Crew Members Sample Leafy Greens Grown on Space Station|first=Kristine|last=Rainey|date=7 August 2015|website=Nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Robonaut 2.jpg|thumb|NASA has stated that robots will prepare an underground base for a human surface mission.&lt;ref name=bolden /&gt;]]

Significant technological hurdles need to be overcome for human spaceflight to Mars.

Entry into the thin and shallow Martian atmosphere will pose significant difficulties with re-entry and for a spacecraft of the weight needed to carry humans, along with life support, supplies and other equipment. Should a heat shield be used, it would need to be very large. Retro rockets could be used, but would add significant further weight.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

A return mission to Mars will need to land a rocket to carry crew off the surface. Launch requirements mean that this rocket would be significantly smaller than an Earth-to-orbit rocket. Mars-to-orbit launch can also be achieved in single stage. Despite this, landing an ascent rocket on Mars will be difficult. Reentry for a large rocket will be difficult.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 2014 NASA proposed the Mars Ecopoiesis Test Bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/mars-ecopoiesis-test-bed|title=Mars Ecopoiesis Test Bed|last=Hall|first=Loura|date=2017-03-24|work=NASA|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Intravenous fluid
One of the medical supplies that might be needed is a considerable mass of [[intravenous fluid]], which is mainly water but contains other substances so it can be added directly to the human blood stream. If it could be created on the spot from existing water, this would reduce mass requirements. A prototype for this capability was tested on the [[International Space Station]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=ivegen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/IVGEN.html |title=A Solution for Medical Needs and Cramped Quarters in Space IVGEN Undergoes Lifetime Testing in Preparation For Future Missions |work=NASA |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
;Breathing gases
While it is possible for humans to breathe pure oxygen, usually additional gases like nitrogen are included in the breathing mix. One possibility is to take in-situ [[nitrogen]] and [[argon]] from the [[atmosphere of Mars]]; however, they are hard to separate from each other.&lt;ref name=gas /&gt; As a result, a Mars habitat may use 40% argon, 40% nitrogen, and 20% oxygen.&lt;ref name=gas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highmars.org/niac/niac02.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070724100724/http://www.highmars.org/niac/niac02.html |title=The Caves of Mars – Martian Air Breathing Mice |archivedate=24 July 2007 |work=highmars.org |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An idea for keeping carbon dioxide out of the breathing air is to use re-usable [[Carbon dioxide scrubber#Amine scrubbing|amine bead carbon dioxide scrubbers]].&lt;ref name="spectrum.ieee.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/suiting-up-for-the-red-planet|title=Suiting Up for the Red Planet|website=Ieee.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; While one carbon dioxide scrubber filters the astronaut's air, the other is vented to the Mars atmosphere.&lt;ref name="spectrum.ieee.org" /&gt;

== Precursor missions ==
Some missions may be considered a "Mission to Mars" in their own right, or they may only be one step in a more in-depth program. An example of this is missions to Mars' moons, or flyby missions.

=== Missions to Deimos or Phobos ===
Many Mars mission concepts propose precursor missions to the moons of Mars, for example a sample return mission to the Mars moon Phobos&lt;ref name="authors.library.caltech.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/59437/|title=Manned sample return mission to Phobos: A technology demonstration for human exploration of Mars|first1=Bosanac|last1=Natasha|first2=Diaz|last2=Ana|first3=Dang|last3=Victor|first4=Ebersohn|last4=Frans|first5=Gonzalez|last5=Stefanie|first6=Qi|last6=Jay|first7=Sweet|last7=Nicholas|first8=Tie|last8=Norris|first9=Valentino|last9=Gianluca|first10=Fraeman|last10=Abigail|first11=Gibbings|last11=Alison|first12=Maddox|last12=Tyler|first13=Nie|last13=Chris|first14=Rankin|last14=Jamie|first15=Rebelo|last15=Tiago|first16=Taylor|last16=Graeme|date=1 March 2014|website=Authors.library.caltech.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; – not quite Mars, but perhaps a convenient stepping stone to an eventual Martian surface mission. Lockheed Martin, as part of their "Stepping stones to Mars" project, called the "Red Rocks Project", proposed to explore Mars robotically from Deimos.&lt;ref name="footstepstomars" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larry Page [http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/604658main_5%20-%20Orion_MPCV_-_Human_Space_Exploration_Workshop_-_San_Diego1%201.pdf Deep Space Exploration – Stepping Stones] builds up to "Red Rocks : Explore Mars from Deimos"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/11437-mars-moons-exploration-astronauts-red-rocks.html |title=One Possible Small Step Toward Mars Landing: A Martian Moon |work=Space.com |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of fuel produced from water resources on Phobos or Deimos has also been proposed.

=== Mars sample return missions ===
[[File:Scim br.jpg|thumb|Artist concept of SCIM gathering a sample of the Martian atmosphere.]]
[[File:Mars sample returnjpl.jpg|thumb|Sample return mission concept]]

An uncrewed [[Mars sample return mission]] (MSR) has sometimes been considered as a precursor to crewed missions to Mars' surface.&lt;ref name="esa.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/Mars_Sample_Return_bridging_robotic_and_human_exploration|title=Mars Sample Return: bridging robotic and human exploration
 |last=esa|website=Esa.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[European Space Agency|ESA]] called a sample return "essential" and said it could bridge the gap between robotic and human missions to Mars.&lt;ref name="esa.int" /&gt; An example of a Mars sample return mission is [[Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars]] (SCIM).&lt;ref name="USRA-2008"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jones, S.M. |display-authors=etal

 |date=2008 |publisher=[[Universities Space Research Association|USRA]] |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mars sample return was the highest priority Flagship Mission proposed for NASA by the ''Planetary Decadal Survey 2013–2022: The Future of Planetary Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such missions have been hampered by complexity and expense, with one ESA proposal involving no less than five different uncrewed spacecraft.&lt;ref name="ESA – Mars Sample Return"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Exploration/Mars_Sample_Return2
 |title=Mars Sample Return|website=Esa.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample return plans raise the concern, however remote, that an infectious agent could be brought to Earth.&lt;ref name="ESA – Mars Sample Return" /&gt; Regardless, a basic set of guidelines for extraterrestrial sample return have been laid out depending on the source of sample (e.g. asteroid, Moon, Mars surface, etc.)&lt;ref name="congrexprojects.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.congrexprojects.com/docs/default-source/13c06_docs/session-1-rebuffat.pdf?sfvrsn=0 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117020758/http://www.congrexprojects.com/docs/default-source/13c06_docs/session-1-rebuffat.pdf?sfvrsn=0 |archive-date=2015-11-17 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the dawn of the 21st century, NASA crafted four potential pathways to Mars human missions.&lt;ref name=marsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/mars-future-05f.html|title=Next On Mars|website=Spacedaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those four, three included a Mars sample return as a prerequisite to human landing; however one did not.&lt;ref name=marsd /&gt;

=== Crewed orbital missions ===
Starting in 2004, NASA scientists have proposed to explore Mars via [[telepresence]] from human astronauts in orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landis | first1 = G.A. | year = 2008| title = Teleoperation from Mars Orbit: A Proposal for Human Exploration | doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.12.049 | journal = Acta Astronautica | volume = 62 | issue = 1| pages = 59–65 | bibcode = 2008AcAau..62...59L }}; presented as paper IAC-04-IAA.3.7.2.05, 55th International Astronautical Federation Congress, Vancouver BC, Oct. 4-8 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lupisella"&gt;M.

LPI Contribution No. 1089.  (accessed 11/15/2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar idea was the proposed "Human Exploration using Real-time Robotic Operations" (HERRO) mission.&lt;ref&gt;George R. Schmidt, Geoffrey A. Landis, and Steven R.
