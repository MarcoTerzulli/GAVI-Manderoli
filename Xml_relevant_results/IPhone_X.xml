It was available to pre-order on October 27, 2017 and was released on November 3, 2017.

The iPhone X was intended to showcase what Apple considered the technology of the future. Using a glass and stainless-steel form factor and "[[bezel (screen)|bezel-less]]" design, shrinking the bezels, and not having a "chin", unlike many Android phones.  It was the first iPhone to use an [[OLED]] screen. The home button was replaced with a new type of authentication called [[Face ID]], which used sensors to [[Facial recognition system|scan the user's face]] to unlock the device. This face-recognition capability also enabled emojis to be animated following the user's expression (Animoji). With a bezel-less design, iPhone user interaction changed significantly, using gestures to navigate the operating system rather than the home button used in all previous iPhones. At the time of its November 2017 launch, its price tag of $999 USD also made it the most expensive iPhone ever, with even higher prices internationally due to additional local sales and import taxes.

The iPhone X received generally positive reviews. Its display and build quality were widely praised, and the camera also scored positively on tests. The phone received polarized reception due to the sensor housing "[[notch (engineering)|notch]]" at the top of the screen and the introduction of an all-new authentication method. The notch was heavily mocked by users on social media, although app developers responded either neutrally or positively to the changes it brought to the user experience in their apps and games. Reviewers had mixed reactions, with some condemning it and others acknowledging it as unusual in the first moments of use before getting accustomed to its presence. [[Face ID]] facial recognition was praised for its simple setup, but criticized for requiring direct eyes on the screen, though that option can be disabled within the [[system preferences]].

Along with the [[iPhone 6s]], its Plus variant, and the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone SE]], the iPhone X was discontinued on September 12, 2018 following the announcement of the [[iPhone XS|iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max]] and [[iPhone XR]] devices. As a result, with a shelf life of just over 10 months, the iPhone X had the shortest ever tenure as the flagship device in the history of the iPhone.

On November 22, 2018, Apple reportedly resumed production of the iPhone X due to weak sales of its successors. The iPhone X remains discontinued,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/11/22/18107795/iphone-x-production-resumed-weak-demand-2018-models-rumor|title=Apple resumes iPhone X production in face of weak XS sales, report claims|website=www.theverge.com|language=en|accessdate=2018-11-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124054926/https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2018/11/22/18107795/iphone-x-production-resumed-weak-demand-2018-models-rumor|archive-date=November 24, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as of February 2019, Apple started selling refurbished models starting at $769.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/2/4/18211100/apple-iphone-x-refurbished-xr-store|title=Apple is selling refurbished iPhone X models starting at $769|website=theverge.com|date=4 February 2019|language=en|accessdate=4 February 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2019, Apple reduced the price to $599.

Due to its different screen layout, iOS developers are required to update their apps to make full use of the additional screen real estate. Such changes include rounded corners, sensor "notch" at the top of the screen, and an indicator area at the bottom for accessing the home screen. Apple published a "Human Interface Guidelines" document to explain areas of focus, and discouraged developers from attempting to mask or call special attention to any of the new changes. Additionally, text within the app needs to be configured to properly reference Face ID rather than Touch ID where the authentication technology is used on iPhone X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Juli |last=Clover |title=Apple Encourages Developers to Update Their Apps for iPhone X |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/10/27/apple-developer-update-apps-iphone-x/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=October 27, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205194546/https://www.macrumors.com/2017/10/27/apple-developer-update-apps-iphone-x/ |archive-date=December 5, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In anticipation of the release of the phone, most major apps were quickly updated to support the new changes brought by iPhone X,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=iPhone X Apps Now Widely Rolling Out on App Store Ahead of Device's Launch Tomorrow |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/02/iphone-x-ready-apps-list/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=November 2, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205194600/https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/02/iphone-x-ready-apps-list/ |archive-date=December 5, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the required changes did cause delayed app updates for some major apps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chaim |last=Gartenberg |title=Google updates Docs, Slides, and Sheets for iPhone X and iOS 11 |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/27/16705020/google-docs-slides-sheets-update-iphone-x-ios-11-drag-drop-support |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 27, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203120635/https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/27/16705020/google-docs-slides-sheets-update-iphone-x-ios-11-drag-drop-support |archive-date=December 3, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Mitchel |last=Broussard |title=Google Introduces iPhone X Support for Docs, Sheets, and Slides iOS Apps |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/27/google-iphone-x-docs-sheets/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=November 27, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205194558/https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/27/google-iphone-x-docs-sheets/ |archive-date=December 5, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chaim |last=Gartenberg |title=Google Maps gets updated for iPhone X |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/30/16721040/google-maps-apple-iphone-x-update-finally |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 30, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203051632/https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/30/16721040/google-maps-apple-iphone-x-update-finally |archive-date=December 3, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nilay Patel of ''The Verge'' praised the display, calling it "polished and tight and clean" and "bright and colorful". He criticized the repeated lack of a headphone jack, the device's fragility despite Apple's claims of durability, and the sensor notch, calling it "ugly". Patel highlighted the fact that apps required updates to fit the new screen, writing that not all popular apps had received updates by the time of the review, resulting in some apps with "huge black borders" resembling iPhone 8. He especially criticized the positioning of the sensor notch while holding the phone in landscape mode, causing the notch to go "from being a somewhat forgettable element in the top status bar to a giant interruption on the side of the screen". The cameras were given positive feedback for maintaining detail in low-light. Patel particularly praised Animoji, calling it "probably the single best feature on the iPhone X", writing that "they just work, and they work incredibly well". Finally, he wrote that Face ID was the whole foundation of iPhone X, and stated that it "generally works great", though acknowledging the occasional misstep, in which users must "actively move the phone closer to your face to compensate". He specifically criticized the limited range of Face ID, with authentication only working when holding the phone 25–50 centimeters away from the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nilay |last=Patel |title=iPhone X review: face the future |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16579748/apple-iphone-x-review |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 3, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205194545/https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16579748/apple-iphone-x-review |archive-date=December 5, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Velazco of ''Engadget'' also praised the display, writing that, in his experience, the sensor "notch" goes from being "weird at first" to not being noticeable due to action in videos usually happening in the center. The build quality was given particular acclaim, being called "a beautifully made device" with a construction that "seamlessly" connects the front and back glass with the stainless-steel frame. Velazco noted that the new gesture-based interaction takes time getting used to, particularly the Control Center being moved from the bottom to the top right of the display. The camera, processor performance, and battery life were also given positive thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Velazco |title=iPhone X review: Embrace the new normal |url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/03/apple-iphone-x-review/ |website=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[Oath Inc.]] |date=November 3, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203225232/https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/03/apple-iphone-x-review/ |archive-date=December 3, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of repairing an iPhone is also very large compared to its predecessors. If the iPhone X is damaged by user damage (not a manufacturing defect), screen repairs cost USD$279, and other repairs like replacing iPhone X batteries &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=replacing iPhone X batteries|url=https://chamsocdidong.com/thay-pin-iphone-x/ |website=[[BVDT24h]] |accessdate=17 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; are more expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=iPhone Screen Repair |url=https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement |website=support.apple.com |accessdate=17 April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a heavily negative review, Dennis Green of ''Business Insider'' significantly criticized the impossible one-handed use of iPhone X, writing that the new gestures to use the phone, such as swiping from the top down to access notifications and the Control Center, did not work when using the phone with only one hand due to not being able to reach the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dennis |last=Green |title=I've been using my iPhone X for nearly a month, and I've decided I hate it |url=http://nordic.businessinsider.com/iphone-x-negative-review-2017-11 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=November 24, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171129045946/http://nordic.businessinsider.com/iphone-x-negative-review-2017-11 |archive-date=November 29, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His review sparked outrage among [[Twitter]] users, many of whom used condescending tones, which Green reasoned as "I don't know whether the anger was directed toward me out of loyalty to Apple or to justify their own choice to spend $1,000 on a phone. It was obvious that much of the criticism came from people who had never used the phone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dennis |last=Green |title=I wrote about how much I hate my iPhone X — and an army of Apple fans attacked me online |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/negative-iphone-x-review-sparks-uproar-2017-11 |website=[[Business Insider]] |publisher=[[Axel Springer SE]] |date=November 30, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203235834/http://www.businessinsider.com/negative-iphone-x-review-sparks-uproar-2017-11 |archive-date=December 3, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Macworld''{{'}}s Roman Loyola praised the Face ID authentication system, writing that the setup process was "easy" and that its system integration was "more seamless" than the Touch ID fingerprint authentication of the past. That said, Loyola did note the "half-second" slower unlocking time than Touch ID as well as needing to look directly at the screen, making it impossible to unlock with the phone next to the user on a desk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roman |last=Loyola |title=iPhone X review: The thrill is back |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/3236870/iphone-ipad/iphone-x-review.html |website=[[Macworld]] |publisher=[[International Data Group]] |date=November 14, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205194620/https://www.macworld.com/article/3236870/iphone-ipad/iphone-x-review.html |archive-date=December 5, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Face ID security and privacy concerns===
Face ID has raised concerns regarding the possibility of law enforcement accessing an individual's phone by pointing the device at the user's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Madison Malone |last=Kircher |title=Yes, You Can Unlock the New iPhone With Your Face.

However, despite Apple's promise of increased security of Face ID compared to the Touch ID fingerprint authentication system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Warren |title=Apple's Face ID struggles detailed in new iPhone X report |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542614/apple-iphone-x-face-id-manufacturing-issues-report |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=October 25, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204223019/https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/25/16542614/apple-iphone-x-face-id-manufacturing-issues-report |archive-date=December 4, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; there have been multiple media reports indicating otherwise. ''The Verge'' noted that courts in the United States have granted different Fifth Amendment rights in the United States Constitution to biometric unlocking systems as opposed to keycodes. Keycodes are considered "testimonial" evidence based on the contents of users' thoughts, whereas fingerprints are considered physical evidence, with some suspects having been ordered to unlock their phones via fingerprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adi |last=Robertson |title=Why Face ID won't give you the legal protection of a passcode |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16298192/apple-iphone-face-id-legal-security-fifth-amendment |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 12, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204223017/https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16298192/apple-iphone-face-id-legal-security-fifth-amendment |archive-date=December 4, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many attempts to break through Face ID with sophisticated masks have been attempted, though most have failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |title=We tried really hard to beat Face ID - and failed (so far) |url=https://www.wired.com/story/tried-to-beat-face-id-and-failed-so-far/ |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=November 3, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205042120/https://www.wired.com/story/tried-to-beat-face-id-and-failed-so-far/ |archive-date=December 5, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A week after iPhone X was released, Vietnamese security firm Bkav announced in a blog post that it had successfully created a $150 mask that tricked Face ID, though ''WIRED'' noted that Bkav's technique was more of a "proof-of-concept" rather than active exploitation risk, with the technique requiring a detailed measurement or digital scan of the iPhone owner's face, putting the real risk of danger only to targets of espionage and world leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |title=Hackers say they've broken Face ID a week after iPhone X release |url=https://www.wired.com/story/hackers-say-broke-face-id-security/ |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=November 12, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205042015/https://www.wired.com/story/hackers-say-broke-face-id-security/ |archive-date=December 5, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Thuy |last=Ong |title=This $150 mask beat Face ID on the iPhone X |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/13/16642690/bkav-iphone-x-faceid-mask |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 13, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204223014/https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/13/16642690/bkav-iphone-x-faceid-mask |archive-date=December 4, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, ''Reuters'' reported in early November 2017 that Apple would share certain facial data on users with third-party app developers for more precise selfie filters and for fictional game characters to mirror real-world user facial expressions. Although developers are required to seek customer permission, are not allowed to sell the data to others nor create profiles on users nor use the data for advertising, and are limited to a more "rough map" rather than full capabilities, they still get access to over 50 kinds of facial expressions. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Center for Democracy and Technology raised privacy questions about Apple's enforcement of the privacy restrictions connected to third-party access, with Apple maintaining that its App Store review processes were effective safeguards. The "rough map" of facial data third-parties can access is also not enough to unlock the device, according to ''Reuters''. However, the overall idea of letting developers access sensitive facial information was still not satisfactorily handled, according to Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the ACLU, with Stanley telling ''Reuters'' that "the privacy issues around of the use of very sophisticated facial recognition technology for unlocking the phone have been overblown. … The real privacy issues have to do with the access by third-party developers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stephen |last=Nellis |title=App developer access to iPhone X face data spooks some privacy experts |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone-privacy-analysis/app-developer-access-to-iphone-x-face-data-spooks-some-privacy-experts-idUSKBN1D20DZ |website=[[Reuters]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |date=November 2, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205093114/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone-privacy-analysis/app-developer-access-to-iphone-x-face-data-spooks-some-privacy-experts-idUSKBN1D20DZ |archive-date=December 5, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Statt |title=Apple will share face mapping data from the iPhone X with third-party app developers |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16599592/apple-iphone-x-face-id-data-share-app-developers-privacy |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=November 2, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204223015/https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16599592/apple-iphone-x-face-id-data-share-app-developers-privacy |archive-date=December 4, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensor housing controversy===
Much of the debate about the iPhone X has revolved around the design of the sensor housing, dubbed "notch" by the media, at the top of the display. ''The Outline'' described it as "a visually disgusting element",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joshua |last=Topolsky |title=Apple is really bad at design |url=https://theoutline.com/post/2352/apple-is-really-bad-at-design |website=[[The Outline (website)|The Outline]] |date=September 29, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206005836/https://theoutline.com/post/2352/apple-is-really-bad-at-design |archive-date=December 6, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Verge'' posted a report focusing on public criticism and people mocking Apple's "odd design choice",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tom |last=Warren |title=Apple's iPhone X notch is an odd design choice |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16306298/apple-iphone-x-screen-notch |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=September 14, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204223008/https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16306298/apple-iphone-x-screen-notch |archive-date=December 4, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but not every reviewer was equally negative in their opinions. Third-party iOS developers interviewed by ''Ars Technica'' said that, despite the work of restructuring design elements in their apps, the notch did not cause any problems, with some even arguing that the notch was a good push to simplify their designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Samuel |last=Axon |title=How app developers and designers feel about the iPhone X—and the notch |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/how-devs-updated-their-apps-for-the-iphone-xs-screen-and-the-notch/2/ |website=[[Ars Technica]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast]] |date=November 25, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205143534/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/how-devs-updated-their-apps-for-the-iphone-xs-screen-and-the-notch/2/ |archive-date=December 5, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two weeks after iPhone X's release, Apple approved a "notch remover" app through the App Store, that places black bars across the top of the home screen to make the notch visually disappear.

In November 2017, early adopters of the new phone reported that they were experiencing activation issues on certain cellular carriers, most notably [[AT&amp;T]].

===Cellular modem differences===
Apple has been engaged in a legal battle with [[Qualcomm]] over allegedly anti-competitive practices and has been dual-sourcing cellular modem chips to reduce reliance on the semiconductor manufacturer. Starting with iPhone 7 in 2016, Apple has used about half Qualcomm modem chips and half Intel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Aaron |last=Pressman |title=What Qualcomm Chips Do and Why Apple Ditching Them Would Be Important |url=http://fortune.com/2017/10/31/qualcomm-chips-apple-iphone-ditch/ |website=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |date=October 31, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111041833/http://fortune.com/2017/10/31/qualcomm-chips-apple-iphone-ditch/ |archive-date=November 11, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buy unlocked"&gt;{{cite web |first=Sascha |last=Segan |title=Why You Should Buy an Unlocked or Verizon iPhone 8, iPhone X |url=http://uk.pcmag.com/news/91205/why-you-should-buy-an-unlocked-or-verizon-iphone-8-iphone-x |website=[[PC Magazine]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=September 18, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201102132/http://uk.pcmag.com/news/91205/why-you-should-buy-an-unlocked-or-verizon-iphone-8-iphone-x |archive-date=December 1, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional measurement tests performed by wireless signal testing firm ''Cellular Insights'' indicated that, as in the previous-gen [[iPhone 7#Performance differences|iPhone 7]], Qualcomm's chips outperform Intel's in LTE download speeds, up to 67% faster in very weak signal conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=iPhone X Models With Qualcomm Modem Still Have Faster LTE Speeds Than Those With Intel Modems |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/01/qualcomm-iphone-x-still-faster-than-intel/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |date=December 1, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203203157/https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/01/qualcomm-iphone-x-still-faster-than-intel/ |archive-date=December 3, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dan |last=Dziedzic |title=Every iPhone X is not created equal, new study says |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/not-all-iphone-xs-are-created-equal/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=December 1, 2017 |accessdate=December 4, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203051723/https://www.cnet.com/news/not-all-iphone-xs-are-created-equal/ |archive-date=December 3, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in some sources recommending the purchase of an unlocked iPhone X or one bought through cellular carrier [[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]], in order to get the models featuring the faster Qualcomm modem.&lt;ref name="Buy unlocked" /&gt; Additionally, ''[[CNET]]'' reported in September 2017 that the new iPhone models, including X, [[iPhone 8|8 and 8 Plus]], do not have the ability to connect to the next-generation of [[LTE (telecommunication)|wireless LTE data connection]], despite 10 new [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, including flagships from main smartphone competitor [[Samsung]], all having the capability to do so. While Apple's new smartphones have support for "[[LTE Advanced]]", with a theoretical peak speed of 500 [[megabit]]s per second, the Android models have the ability to connect to "Gigabit LTE", allowing theoretical speeds up to 1 [[gigabit]] per second, doubling Apple's speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roger |last=Cheng |title=Apple's iPhone X, iPhone 8 lack a feature the Galaxy S8 rocks |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-iphone-x-iphone-8-lack-one-feature-on-the-galaxy-s8/ |website=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=September 20, 2017 |accessdate=December 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208175058/https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-iphone-x-iphone-8-lack-one-feature-on-the-galaxy-s8/ |archive-date=December 8, 2017 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NFC problems===
After releasing the iPhone X in Japan and China, customers experienced issues related to the phone's [[Near-field communication|NFC]] while trying to access public transit [[contactless smart card|smart card readers]]. In April 2018, Apple released a revision to the iPhone X, that included a vastly improved NFC chip. This solved the problem of NFC reader errors in most cases. Previously around 1 out of 3 NFC attempts would fail after initial reports. This issue also affected users in America.&lt;ref name="Breckinridge Bassett"/&gt;

===Display Module Replacement Program===
Apple has determined an issue with certain iPhone X devices where the display wouldn't respond to the user's touch, due to a component that might fail on the display module. Apple stated that they will repair the affected devices, free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/iphone-x-display-module-replacement-program|title=iPhone X Display Module Replacement Program for Touch Issues - Apple Support|website=support.apple.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
