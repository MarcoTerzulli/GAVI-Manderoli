Biel landed her first feature film role as [[Peter Fonda]]'s granddaughter in the critically acclaimed drama ''[[Ulee's Gold]]'', released in 1997. Her performance earned her a [[Young Artist Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Young Artist Award winners|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topiclist/Young-Artist-Award-winners|work=The Times of India|publisher=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

In 2002, she starred as [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] college student, Lara, in the ensemble film ''[[The Rules of Attraction (film)|The Rules of Attraction]]'', an adaptation of the [[Bret Easton Ellis]] [[The Rules of Attraction|novel]].

Biel starred in the thriller film ''[[Emanuel and the Truth About Fishes]]'', which premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 18, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Francesca Gregorini Channels Personal Plight in Making Emanuel and the Truth About Fishes |url=http://www.sundance.org/festival/article/francesca-gregorini-dispels-demons-in-emanuel-and-the-truth-about-fishes/ |accessdate=September 19, 2013 |publisher=sundance.org |date=April 23, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053853/http://www.sundance.org/festival/article/francesca-gregorini-dispels-demons-in-emanuel-and-the-truth-about-fishes/ |archivedate=September 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, Biel began working on the political satire ''[[Nailed (film)|Nailed]]'', with [[Jake Gyllenhaal]]. The film centers around a woman who accidentally gets a nail lodged in her head and travels to Washington, D.C. to fight for better health care. In May 2009, Biel spoke about the film's production turmoil, saying: "That was definitely an experience, something I could not say no to. I am a huge David O. Russell fan. It's just heartbreaking that so many people put so much work into this particular project only to have it sit there, unfinished."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/jessica-biel-mourns-david-o-russells-nailed/|title=Jessica Biel Mourns David O.

In 2015, Biel starred in the independent drama ''[[Bleeding Heart (film)|Bleeding Heart]]'', in which she plays a yoga instructor named May who meets her biological sister, Shiva ([[Zosia Mamet]]), a sex worker, for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=April 17, 2015 |title=Zosia Mamet, Jessica Biel Play Femmes On The Edge In 'Bleeding Heart' – Tribeca |url=https://deadline.com/2015/04/bleeding-heart-jessica-biel-zosia-mamet-girls-tribeca-film-festival-1201411724/ |accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film premiered on April 17, 2015, at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]], receiving mixed reviews, though Biel earned praise for her performance. Richard Lawson of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' commented that, "Though she's not given too much to work with in terms of character, Biel plays May with appealing nuance, creating a low-key, bliss-based Angeleno, all light and airy and gentle and poised, who discovers within herself an untapped hardness and anger and strength... when Biel has to conjure up more profound emotions, she proves adept, and surprisingly subtle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Richard|last=Lawson |title=Maybe It's Finally Time for Jessica Biel |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2015/04/bleeding-heart-jessica-biel-tribeca-review |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|location=New York City|date=April 17, 2015|accessdate=April 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clayton Davis of ''AwardsCircuit.com'' also praised her performance, writing, "With an internalized and very subtle performance, Biel excels in her ability to find the very motivation of May."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Clayton|last=Davis|date=April 20, 2015 |title=Film Review: Bleeding Heart |url=http://www.awardscircuit.com/2015/04/20/film-review-bleeding-heart-%E2%98%85%E2%98%85%E2%98%85/ |website=awardscircuit.com|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
