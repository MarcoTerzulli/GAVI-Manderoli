'''''Apocalypto''''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˌ|p|ɒ|k|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|p|t|oʊ}}) is a 2006 American [[epic film|epic]] [[historical drama|historical]] [[adventure film]] co-produced, co-written, and directed by [[Mel Gibson]]. The film features a cast of Native American and Indigenous Mexican actors consisting of [[Rudy Youngblood]], [[Raoul Trujillo]], [[Mayra Sérbulo]], Dalia Hernández, Ian Uriel, [[Gerardo Taracena]], Rodolfo Palacios, Bernardo Ruiz Juarez, Ammel Rodrigo Mendoza, Ricardo Diaz Mendoza, and [[Israel Contreras]]. Similar to Gibson's earlier film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', all dialogue is in a modern approximation of the ancient language of the setting. Here, the Indigenous [[Yucatec Maya language]] is spoken, with subtitles, which sometimes refer to the language as [[Mayan languages|Mayan]]. This was the last film Gibson directed until 2016's ''[[Hacksaw Ridge]]'' ten years later.

Set in [[Yucatán]], [[Mexico]], around the year [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|1502]], ''Apocalypto'' portrays the [[hero's journey]] of a young man named Jaguar Paw, a late [[Mesoamerica]]n hunter and his fellow tribesmen who are captured by an invading force after the devastation of their village and brought on a perilous journey to a [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] city for [[human sacrifice in Maya culture|human sacrifice]] at a time when the Maya civilization is in decline. The film was a box office success, grossing over $120 million worldwide, and received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising Gibson's direction, [[Dean Semler]]'s cinematography, the performances of the cast, and the portrayal of [[Mayan civilization]].

All of the ethnic tribes and peoples depicted in the film were [[Maya peoples|Maya]], as Gibson wanted to depict the Maya city built for the story as an "Unknown world" to the character. 

==Plot==
While hunting in the [[Mesoamerican]] rainforest, Jaguar Paw, his father Flint Sky, and their fellow tribesmen encounter a procession of refugees fleeing warfare. The group's leader explains that their lands were ravaged and they seek a new beginning. He asks for permission to pass through the jungle. Flint Sky comments to his son that the visitors were sick with fear and urges him to never allow fear to infect him.

At sunrise the next morning, the tribe's village is raided by a group led by Zero Wolf. Huts are set on fire, many villagers are killed, and the rest of the adults are taken captive. Jaguar Paw nearly kills the sadistic raider Middle Eye, who kills the captive Flint Sky in retaliation and names Jaguar Paw "Almost". Jaguar Paw's heavily pregnant wife Seven and their young son Turtles Run escape by hiding in a small natural [[pit cave]] that also serves as a water reservoir, but are left trapped when Jaguar Paw is captured. The raiders then lead the captives on a long forced march through the jungle, leaving the children behind to fend for themselves.

On the journey, Cocoa Leaf, a badly wounded captive, is killed by Middle Eye, eliciting anger from Zero Wolf, who threatens his fellow raider with death if he kills another captive without permission. As the party approaches the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]n city from which the raiders come, they encounter razed forests and failed maize crops, along with villages decimated by an unknown disease. A little girl infected with the illness prophesies Zero Wolf's death and the end of the Mayan world. Once the raiders and captives reach the city the females are sold as slaves while the males are escorted to the top of a [[Mesoamerican pyramids#Maya|step pyramid]] to be [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]] before the Mayan King and Queen.

As a result of a solar eclipse and the superstitions surrounding it, Jaguar Paw and the remaining captives are spared from being sacrificed. Instead, they are taken to be used as target practice by Zero Wolf and his men, and offered their freedom if they can run to safety before being killed. Jaguar Paw is injured but kills Zero Wolf's son Cut Rock, and escapes into the jungle. Zero Wolf and eight of his comrades chase after him in vengeance. Back in his native jungle, Jaguar Paw now has the advantage and taunts his pursuers. Most of the hunters—including Zero Wolf and Middle Eye—are gradually killed off via natural hazards and traps laid out by Jaguar Paw, until there are only two left.

The drought breaks and heavy rain begins to fall, threatening to drown Jaguar Paw's family, who are still trapped in the pit cave despite their attempts to escape. Seven gives birth to another son, who is born into the now dangerously rising water. Meanwhile, the two remaining raiders chase Jaguar Paw out of the undergrowth towards the coast. As they reach the beach, all three are stopped in their tracks by the sight of [[conquistador]] ships anchored off the coast and Spaniards making their way ashore, holding up a large [[Christian cross|cross]]. Jaguar Paw flees while the two raiders remain, seemingly mesmerized at the conquerors' presence. Jaguar Paw returns in time to save his family from the flooded pit and is overjoyed at the sight of his new baby son.

Sometime later, as the reunited family looks out over the water at the Spanish ships, Jaguar Paw decides not to risk approaching the conquerors, insisting his family head back into the jungle. They depart in search of a new home and a new beginning.

==Production==

===Screenplay===
[[File:Mel Gibson Cannes 2016 3.jpg|thumb|[[Mel Gibson]] directed ''Apocalypto'' after he made ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'']]

Screenwriter and co-producer [[Farhad Safinia]] first met [[Mel Gibson]] while working as an assistant during the post-production of ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''. Eventually, Gibson and Safinia found time to discuss "their mutual love of movies and what excites them about moviemaking".&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/15/AR2006121500342.html|author=Nicole Sperling|title=With help from a friend, Mel cut to the chase |work=The Washington Post |date=December 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|We started to talk about what to do next, but we specifically spent a lot of time on the action-chase genre of filmmaking. Those conversations essentially grew into the skeleton of ('Apocalypto'). We wanted to update the chase genre by, in fact, not updating it with technology or machinery but stripping it down to its most intense form, which is a man running for his life, and at the same time getting back to something that matters to him.&lt;br&gt;{{emdash}}Farhad Safinia&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;}}

Gibson said they wanted to "shake up the stale action-[[adventure film|adventure]] genre", which he felt was dominated by [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], stock stories and shallow characters and to create a footchase that would "feel like a car chase that just keeps turning the screws."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1174684,00.html |title=Apocalypto Now |author=Tim Padgett |work=Time Magazine |date=March 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson and Safinia were also interested in portraying and exploring an ancient culture as it existed before the arrival of the Europeans. Considering both the [[Aztecs]] and the Maya, they eventually chose the Maya for their high sophistication and their eventual decline.

{{cquote|The Mayas were far more interesting to us. You can choose a civilization that is bloodthirsty, or you can show the Maya civilization that was so sophisticated with an immense knowledge of medicine, science, archaeology and engineering ... but also be able to illuminate the brutal undercurrent and ritual savagery that they practiced. It was a far more interesting world to explore why and what happened to them.&lt;br&gt;{{emdash}}Farhad Safinia&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;}}

The two researched ancient Maya history, reading both [[creation myth|creation]] and [[eschatology|destruction myth]]s, including sacred texts such as the ''[[Popul Vuh]].''&lt;ref name="wildaboutmovies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/movies/ApocalyptoMovieTrailerPosterMelGibson.php |title=''Apocalypto'' First Look |publisher=WildAboutMovies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the audio commentary of the film's first DVD release, Safinia states that the old [[shaman]]'s story (played by [[Espiridion Acosta Cache]], a modern-day Maya storyteller&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://video.movies.go.com/apocalypto/ |title=Official ''Apocalypto'' DVD Website |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611220458/http://video.movies.go.com/apocalypto/ |archivedate=June 11, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was modified from an authentic Mesoamerican tale that was re-translated by [[Hilario Chi Canul]], a professor of Maya, into the [[Yucatec Maya language]] for the film. He also served as a dialogue coach during production. As they researched the script, Safinia and Gibson traveled to Guatemala, Costa Rica and the [[Yucatán peninsula]] to scout filming locations and visit Maya ruins.

Striving for a degree of historical accuracy, the filmmakers employed a consultant, [[Richard D. Hansen]], a specialist in the Maya and assistant professor of archaeology at [[Idaho State University]]. As director of the [[Mirador Basin]] Project, he works to preserve a large swath of the Guatemalan rain forest and its Maya ruins. Gibson has said of Hansen's involvement: "Richard's enthusiasm for what he does is infectious. He was able to reassure us and make us feel secure that what we were writing had some authenticity as well as imagination."&lt;ref name="wildaboutmovies"/&gt;

Other scholars of Mesoamerican history criticized the film for what they said were numerous inaccuracies.&lt;ref name="natlgeo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/12/061208-apocalypto-mel_2.html |title="Apocalypto" Tortures the Facts, Expert Says |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=October 28, 2010 |accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pack"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGuire |first=Mark |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061212/news_1c12mel.html |title='Apocalypto' a pack of inaccuracies &amp;#124 |work=The San Diego Union-Tribune |publisher=Signonsandiego.com |date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of scholars have also risen to defend the film citing ignorance or political correctness as the primary motivator for the criticisms.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} A recent essay by Hansen on the film and a critical commentary on the criticisms of the film is now published.&lt;ref name=Chacon&gt;Hansen, Richard D. "Relativism, Revisionism, Aboriginalism and Emic/Etic Truth: The Case Study of ''Apocalypto''." Book chapter in: "[https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-1065-2 The Ethics of Anthropology and Amerindian Research]", edited by Richard J. Chacon and Ruben G. Mendoza, pp.&amp;nbsp;147–190. Springer Press, New York, Dordrecht, Heidelberg, London 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson decided that all the dialogue would be in the [[Yucatec Maya language]].&lt;ref name="boxofficeprophets"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficeprophets.com/tickermaster/listing.cfm?tmID=2835 |title=Prophets-Apoc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson explains: "I think hearing a different language allows the audience to completely suspend their own reality and get drawn into the world of the film. And more importantly, this also puts the emphasis on the cinematic visuals, which are a kind of universal language of the heart."&lt;ref name="wildaboutmovies"/&gt;

===Costumes and makeup===
{{See also|Maya textiles}}
The production team consisted of a large group of make-up artists and costume designers who worked to recreate the Maya look for the large cast. Led by [[Aldo Signoretti]], the make-up artists daily applied the required tattoos, scarification, and earlobe extensions to all of the on-screen actors. According to advisor [[Richard D. Hansen]], the choices in body make-up were based on both artistic license and fact: "I spent hours and hours going through the pottery and the images looking for tattoos. The scarification and tattooing was all researched, the inlaid jade teeth are in there, the [[earspool|ear spools]] are in there. There is a little doohickey that comes down from the ear through the nose into the [[Nasal septum|septum]] – that was entirely their artistic innovation."&lt;ref name="archaeology701"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.archaeology.org/0701/etc/conversation.html |title=Mel Gibson's Maya |journal=Archaeology |volume=60 |issue=1 |date=January–February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of attention to detail is the left arm tattoo of Seven, Jaguar Paw's wife, which is a horizontal band with two dots above – the [[Maya numerals|Mayan symbol for the number seven]].

Simon Atherton, an English [[armorer]] and weapon-maker who worked with Gibson on ''[[Braveheart]]'', was hired to research and provide reconstructions of Maya weapons. Atherton also has a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] as the cross-bearing [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] who appears on a Spanish ship at the end of the film.

===Set design===
{{See also|Maya architecture}}
[[File:Tikal6.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Pyramid]]s like this at [[Tikal]] were reproduced for the film]]
[[Mel Gibson]] wanted ''Apocalypto'' to feature sets with buildings rather than relying on [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated images]]. Most of the step [[pyramids]] seen at the Maya city were models designed by [[Thomas E. Sanders]]. Sanders explained his approach: "We wanted to set up the Mayan world, but we were not trying to do a documentary. Visually, we wanted to go for what would have the most impact. Just as on ''Braveheart'', you are treading the line of history and cinematography. Our job is to do a beautiful movie."&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{Cite news|title=''Apocalypto's'' look mixes fact and fiction |author=Susan King |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while many of the architectural details of Maya cities are correct,&lt;ref name="pack"/&gt; they are blended from different locations and eras,&lt;ref name="pack" /&gt; a decision [[Farhad Safinia]] said was made for aesthetic reasons.&lt;ref name="globalheritagefund"&gt;{{cite web

 |quote       = About 25 members of the Maya community in Los Angeles were invited to an advance screening of Gibson's film last week. Two of those who attended came away impressed, but added that they too wished Gibson had shown more of the Maya civilization. "It was a great action film that kept me on the edge of my seat," said Sara Zapata Mijares, president and founder of Federacion de Clubes Yucatecos-USA. "I think it should have had a little bit more of the culture", such as the pyramids. "It could have shown a little more why these buildings were built.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Apocalypto'' is set during the terminal post-classic period of Maya civilization, the central pyramid of the film comes from the classic period, which ended in A.D. 900,&lt;ref name="globalheritagefund"/&gt; such as those found in the Postclassic sites of Muyil, Coba, and others in Quintana Roo, Mexico, where later cities are built around earlier pyramids. The temples are in the shape of those of [[Tikal]] in the central lowlands [[Mesoamerican chronology|classic]] style but decorated with the [[Puuc]] style elements of the northwest Yucatán centuries later. [[Richard D. Hansen]] comments, "There was nothing in the post-classic period that would match the size and majesty of that pyramid in the film. But Gibson ... was trying to depict opulence, wealth, consumption of resources."&lt;ref name="globalheritagefund"/&gt; The mural in the arched walkway combined elements from the [[Maya codices]], the [[Bonampak]] murals (over 700 years earlier than the film's setting), and the [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]] murals (some 1500 years earlier than the film's setting).{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Filming===
Gibson filmed ''Apocalypto'' mainly in [[Catemaco]], [[San Andrés Tuxtla]] and [[Paso de Ovejas]] in the Mexican state of [[Veracruz]]. The waterfall scene was filmed at [[Eyipantla Falls]], located in San Andrés Tuxtla. Other filming by second-unit crews took place in [[El Petén]], Guatemala. The film was originally slated for an August 4, 2006, release, but [[Touchstone Pictures]] delayed the release date to December 8, 2006, due to heavy rains and two hurricanes interfering with filming in Mexico. Principal photography ended in July 2006.

''Apocalypto'' was shot on [[High-definition video|high-definition]] [[digital video]], using the [[Genesis (Panavision)|Panavision Genesis]] camera.&lt;ref name="cinematech"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematech.blogspot.com/2006/06/dion-beebe-dean-semler-tom-sigel-and.html |title=Dion Beebe, Dean Semler, Tom Sigel, and others on Digital Cinematography |date=June 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During filming, Gibson and cinematographer [[Dean Semler]] employed [[Spydercam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spydercam.com/info-work.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040602045424/http://www.spydercam.com/info-work.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2004-06-02 |title=spydercam: Info – Work History }}&lt;/ref&gt; a suspended camera system allowing shooting from above. This equipment was used in a scene in which Jaguar Paw leaps off a waterfall.

{{cquote|sign=|source=|We had a Spydercam shot from the top of [the] 150-foot [46 m] waterfall, looking over an actor's shoulder and then plunging over the edge{{emdash}}literally in the waterfall. I thought we'd be doing it on film, but we put the Genesis [camera] up there in a light-weight water housing. The temperatures were beyond 100 degrees [38 °C] at [the] top, and about 60 degrees [15 °C] at the bottom, with the water and the mist. We shot two fifty-minute tapes without any problems{{emdash}}though we [did get] water in there once and fogged up.&lt;ref name="cinematech"/&gt;}}

A number of animals are featured in ''Apocalypto'', including a [[Baird's tapir]] and a [[Black panther|black jaguar]]. [[Animatronics]] or puppets were employed for the scenes injurious to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tapirs.org/news/interviews/apocalypto-interview.html |title=The First Tapir Movie Star? |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215153155/http://www.tapirs.org/news/interviews/apocalypto-interview.html |archivedate=February 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
{{Further|Apocalypto (soundtrack)}}
The soundtrack to ''Apocalypto'' was composed by [[James Horner]] in his third collaboration with director [[Mel Gibson]]. The soundtrack lacks a traditional orchestral score and instead features a large array of exotic instruments and vocals by Pakistani singer [[Rahat Fateh Ali Khan]].

==Distribution and marketing==
While [[Mel Gibson]] financed the film through his [[Icon Productions]], [[List of assets owned by Disney#Studio Entertainment|Disney]] signed on to [[film distribution|distribute]] ''Apocalypto'' for a fee in certain markets under the [[Touchstone Pictures]] label. The publicity for the film started with a December 2005 teaser trailer that was filmed before the start of principal photography and before [[Rudy Youngblood]] was cast as Jaguar Paw. As a joke, Gibson inserted a subliminal cameo of the bearded director in a plaid shirt with a cigarette hanging from his mouth posing next to a group of dust-covered Maya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Suddenly, Next Summer| author = Caryn James |work=New York Times |date=December 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clean-shaven Gibson also filmed a Mayan-language segment for the introduction of the 2006 [[Academy Awards]] in which he declined to host the ceremony.
On September 23, 2006, Gibson pre-screened the unfinished film to two predominantly Native American audiences in the [[U.S. state|US state]] of [[Oklahoma]], at the [[Riverwind Casino]] in [[Goldsby, Oklahoma|Goldsby]], owned by the [[Chickasaw Nation]], and at [[Cameron University]] in [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gibson takes 'Apocalypto' to Oklahoma |agency=Associated Press |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060923/ap_en_mo/people_gibson;_ylt=At.UMCekCL7XVfunzQLqJiqs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3YXYwNDRrBHNlYwM3NjI- |archivedate=September 28, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928090615/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060923/ap_en_mo/people_gibson%3B_ylt%3DAt.UMCekCL7XVfunzQLqJiqs0NUE%3B_ylu%3DX3oDMTA3YXYwNDRrBHNlYwM3NjI- |url-status=live |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also did a pre-screening in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Texas, on September 24 in conjunction with one of the film's stars, [[Rudy Youngblood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Mel campaigns for new movie, against war in Iraq |publisher=Reuters |date=September 24, 2006 |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&amp;storyid=2006-09-25T031220Z_01_N24227883_RTRUKOC_0_US-GIBSON.xml&amp;src=rss&amp;rpc=22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908235719/http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=entertainmentNews |archivedate=September 8, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Los Angeles, Gibson screened ''Apocalypto'' and participated in a Q&amp;A session for Latin Business Association&lt;ref name="RWWelkos"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/13/entertainment/et-apocalypto13 |title=Gibson dives in |author=Robert W.

==Themes==
According to [[Mel Gibson]], the Mayan setting of ''Apocalypto'' is "merely the backdrop" for a more universal story of exploring "civilizations and what undermines them".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mel Gibson's latest passion: Maya culture |author=Reed Johnson |work=Los Angeles Times |date=October 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The background to the events depicted is the terminal Postclassic period, immediately prior to the arrival of the Spanish, ca. 1511, which the filmmakers researched before writing. 

The corrosive forces of corruption are illustrated in specific scenes throughout the film. Excessive consumption can be seen in the extravagant lifestyle of the upper-class Maya, their vast wealth contrasted with the sickly, the extremely poor, and the enslaved. Environmental degradation is portrayed both in the exploitation of natural resources, such as the over-mining and farming of the land, but also through the treatment of people, families and entire tribes as resources to be harvested and sold into slavery. Political corruption is seen in the leaders' manipulation, the [[human sacrifice]] on a large scale, and the slave trade. The film shows slaves being forced to create the lime [[stucco]] cement that covered the temples, an act that some historians consider a major factor in the Maya decline. One calculation estimates that it would take five tons of jungle forestry to make one ton of [[quicklime]]. Historical consultant [[Richard D. Hansen]] explains, "I found one pyramid in [[El Mirador]] that would have required nearly 650 hectares (1,600 acres) of every single available tree just to cover one building with lime stucco... Epic construction was happening... creating devastation on a huge scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemareview.com/production.asp?prodid=3773 |title=Production Notes: The Heart of Apocalypto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmakers intended this depiction of the [[Maya collapse]] to have relevance for contemporary society. The problems "faced by the Maya are extraordinarily similar to those faced today by our own civilization," co-writer Safinia stated during production, "especially when it comes to widespread environmental degradation, excessive consumption and political corruption".&lt;ref name="wildaboutmovies"/&gt; Gibson has stated that the film is an attempt at illustrating the parallels between a great fallen empire of the past and the great empires of today, saying "People think that modern man is so enlightened, but we're susceptible to the same forces – and we are also capable of the same heroism and transcendence."&lt;ref name="wildaboutmovies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.today.com/id/15001985 |title=Mel Gibson criticizes Iraq war at film fest – Troubled filmmaker draws parallels to collapsing Mayan civilization |agency=Associated Press |date=September 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film serves as a cultural critique – in Hansen's words, a "social statement" – sending the message that it is never a mistake to question our own assumptions about morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6216414.stm |title=Gibson film angers Mayan groups |date=December 8, 2006 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main purpose of the movie has a lot to do with a quote from Will Durant at the very beginning of the movie "A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within", the fighting between tribes, and  the arrival of the Conquerors aboard the ships at the end of the movie.

However, Gibson has also stated that he wanted the film to be hopeful rather than entirely negative. Gibson has defined the title as "a new beginning or an unveiling – a revelation"; he says "Everything has a beginning and an end, and all civilizations have operated like that".&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/Story?id=2670750&amp;page=1 |title=Lost Kingdom: Mel Gibson's ''Apocalypto'' |publisher=[[ABC Primetime]] |date=November 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀποκαλύπτω|ἀποκαλύπτω]]}}, ''apokaluptō'') is in fact a [[verb]] meaning "I uncover", "disclose", or "reveal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languagehat.com/archives/002165.php |title=Making Yucatec Maya "cool again" |date=November 7, 2005 |publisher=[[Language Log]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson has also said a theme of the film is the exploration of primal fears.&lt;ref name="abc"/&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''Apocalypto'' received generally positive reviews from critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 66%, based on 198 reviews, with an average rating of 6.34/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Apocalypto'' is a brilliantly filmed, if mercilessly bloody, examination of a once great civilization."&lt;ref name = "rottentomatoes"&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/apocalypto/ | title = Apocalypto | publisher = Rotten Tomatoes | accessdate = July 19, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 68 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".

[[Richard Roeper]] and guest critic [[Aisha Tyler]] on the television show ''[[At the Movies with Ebert &amp; Roeper|Ebert &amp; Roeper]]'' gave it "two thumbs up" rating.&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;''Ebert &amp; Roeper'' air date December 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Medved]] gave ''Apocalypto'' four stars (out of four) calling the film "an adrenaline-drenched chase movie" and "a visceral visual experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Apocalypto | url = http://images.michaelmedved.com/images/pdf/apocalypto.doc | type = review | first = Michael | last = Medved | format = [[Microsoft Word]] }}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was released less than six months after [[Mel Gibson DUI incident|Gibson's 2006 DUI incident]], which garnered Gibson much negative publicity and magnified concerns some had over alleged antisemitism in his previous film, ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]''.&lt;ref name=Guard0408&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/29/news.melgibson | title = Gibson takes first starring role in six years | place = UK | newspaper = The Guardian | date = April 29, 2008 | accessdate = January 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several key film critics alluded to the incident in their reviews of ''Apocalypto'': In his positive review, ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[A.

''Apocalypto'' gained some passionate champions in the Hollywood community. Actor [[Robert Duvall]] called it "maybe the best movie I've seen in 25 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://idyllist.idyllspress.com/2007/02/10/robert-duvall-on-apocalypto/ |title=Robert Duvall interview |journal=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]] |date=March 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211234607/http://idyllist.idyllspress.com/2007/02/10/robert-duvall-on-apocalypto/ |archivedate=December 11, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://carpetbagger.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/02/12/apocalyptos-biggest-fan/ |title=Apocalypto's Biggest Fan |author=David Carr |date=February 12, 2007 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Quentin Tarantino]] said, "I think it's a masterpiece. It was perhaps the best film of that year. I think it was the best artistic film of that year."&lt;ref&gt;''Interview with Quentin Tarantino, [[FILMINK Magazine]]'', August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Scorsese]], writing about the film, called it "a vision," adding, "Many pictures today don't go into troubling areas like this, the importance of violence in the perpetuation of what's known as civilization. I admire ''Apocalypto'' for its frankness, but also for the power and artistry of the filmmaking."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/global/contentPage.jsp?assetId=P4480016 |title=The Naked Prey ({{sic|1966|expected=1965|nolink=yes}}) and Apocalypto (2006) |journal=[[DIRECTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Edward James Olmos]] said, "I was totally caught off guard. It's arguably the best movie I've seen in years.

On release in Mexico the film registered a wider number of viewers than ''[[Perfume: The Story of a Murderer (film)|Perfume]]'' and ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''. It even displaced memorable Mexican premieres such as ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Poseidon (film)|Poseidon]]''.&lt;ref name="reforma"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Califican con 7.6 a Apocalypto |publisher=Reforma |date=January 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to polls performed by the newspaper ''[[Reforma]]'', 80% of polled Mexicans labeled the film as "very good" or "good".&lt;ref name="reforma"/&gt;

===Awards===
For his role as producer and director of the film, [[Mel Gibson]] was given the Trustee Award by the [[First Americans in the Arts]] organization. Gibson was also awarded the Latino Business Association's Chairman's Visionary Award for his work on ''Apocalypto'' on November 2, 2006, at the Beverly [[Hilton Hotel]] in Los Angeles. At the ceremony, Gibson said that the film was a "badge of honor for the Latino community."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-11-02-gibson-latino-honor_x.htm |title=Gibson honored by Latino business group |work=USA Today | date=November 3, 2006 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson also stated that ''Apocalypto'' would help dismiss the notion that "history only began with Europeans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todoexito.com/events/view/309 |title=TodoExito.com&amp;nbsp;– Events |access-date=May 26, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029225053/http://www.todoexito.com/events/view/309 |archive-date=October 29, 2007 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Representation of the Maya===

Many writers felt that Gibson's film was relatively accurate about the Maya, since it depicts the era of decline and division that followed the civilization's peak, collapse, re-settlement, and proto-historic societal conditions. One Mexican reporter, Juan E. Pardinas, wrote that "this historical interpretation bears some resemblances with reality .... Mel Gibson's characters are more similar to the Mayas of the [[Bonampak]]'s murals than the ones that appear in the Mexican school textbooks."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|quote=Translation from the original in Spanish: "La mala noticia es que esta interpretación histórica tiene alguna dosis de realidad... Los personajes de Mel Gibson se parecen más a los mayas de los murales de Bonampak que a los que aparecen en los libros de la SEP" |journal=[[Reforma]] |title=Nacionalismo de piel delgada |date=February 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The first researchers tried to make a distinction between the 'peaceful' Maya and the 'brutal' cultures of central Mexico", [[David Stuart (Mayanist)|David Stuart]] wrote in a 2003 article. "They even tried to say human sacrifice was rare among the Maya." But in carvings and mural paintings, Stuart said: "we have now found more and greater similarities between the Aztecs and Mayas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevenson |first=Mark |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6853177 |title=A fresh look at tales of human sacrifice&amp;nbsp;– Technology &amp; science&amp;nbsp;– Science&amp;nbsp;– NBC News |publisher=NBC News |date=January 24, 2005 |accessdate=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard D. Hansen]], who was a historical consultant on the film, stated that the effect the film will have on Maya archaeology will be beneficial:
"It is a wonderful opportunity to focus world attention on the ancient Maya and to realize the role they played in world history."&lt;ref name="archaeology701"/&gt; However, in an interview with ''The Washington Post'', Hansen stated the film "give[s] the feeling they're a sadistic lot", and said, "I'm a little apprehensive about how the contemporary Maya will take it."&lt;ref name="Culture Shocker"/&gt;

Some observers were more cautious. William Booth of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that the film depicts the Maya as a "super-cruel, psycho-sadistic society on the skids, a ghoulscape engaged in widespread slavery, reckless sewage treatment and bad rave dancing, with a real lust for human blood."&lt;ref name="Culture Shocker"&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/08/AR2006120801815_pf.html | title=Culture Shocker | work=Washington Post | date=December 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson compared the savagery in the film to the Bush administration, telling British film magazine ''Hotdog'', "The fear-mongering we depict in the film reminds me of President Bush and his guys."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/05/12/mel_gibson_compares_president_bush_to_ba |title=Mel Gibson Compares President Bush to Barbaric Mayans |accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just prior to its release, ''Apocalypto'' was criticized by activists in Guatemala, including Lucio Yaxon, who charged that the [[Film trailer|trailer]] depicts Maya as savages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6216414.stm |title=Gibson film angers Mayan groups |publisher=BBC |date=December 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review of the film, anthropologist Traci Ardren wrote that ''Apocalypto'' was biased because "no mention is made of the achievements in science and art, the profound spirituality and connection to agricultural cycles, or the engineering feats of Maya cities".&lt;ref name="Archaeology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/reviews/apocalypto.html |title=Is "Apocalypto" Pornography? |publisher=Archaeology Magazine |date=December 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comment is in spite of a scene in the film of a solar eclipse being used by the Maya upper-class in a ruse, which shows very strong astronomical knowledge. ''Apocalypto'' also sparked a strong condemnation from art history professor Julia Guernsey, a Mesoamerican specialist, who said, "I think it's despicable. It's offensive to Maya people. It's offensive to those of us who try to teach cultural sensitivity and alternative world views that might not match our own 21st century Western ones but are nonetheless valid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.statesman.com/search/content/shared/movies/stories/2006/12/history.html |title=''Apocalypto'' is an insult to Maya culture, one expert says |author=Chris Garcia |publisher=[[American-Statesman]] |date=December 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human sacrifice===
{{details|Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|Human sacrifice in Maya culture}}
[[File:Codex Magliabechiano (141 cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|Critics claim that [[human sacrifice]]s depicted in the film are more similar to [[Aztec]] practices (as seen here) than to Mayan.]]
''Apocalypto'' has been criticized for portraying a type of human sacrifice which was more typical of the [[Aztecs]] than of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. [[Archaeologist]] Lisa Lucero said, "the classic Maya really didn't go in for mass sacrifice. That was the Aztecs."&lt;ref name="globalheritagefund"/&gt; [[Anthropology]] professor [[Karl Taube]] argued that, "We know the Aztecs did that level of killing. Their accounts speak of 20,000."&lt;ref name="WmBooth"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/08/AR2006120801815_pf.html |title=Culture Shocker |author=William Booth |work=Washington Post |date=December 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the film's technical advisor, the film was meant to describe the post-classic period of the Maya when fiercer influences like the [[Toltecs]] and Aztecs arrived. According to Hansen, "We know warfare was going on. The Postclassic center of [[Tulum]] is a walled city; these sites had to be in defensive positions. There was tremendous Aztec influence by this time. The Aztecs were clearly ruthless in their conquest and pursuit of sacrificial victims, a practice that spilled over into some of the Maya areas."&lt;ref name="archaeology701"/&gt; Anthropology professor [[Stephen Houston]] made the criticism that sacrifice victims were more likely to be royalty and elites rather than common forest dwellers, as shown in ''Apocalypto''.&lt;ref name="WmBooth" /&gt; Anthropology professor [[Karl Taube]] criticized the film's apparent depiction of widespread [[slavery]], saying, "We have no evidence of large numbers of slaves."&lt;ref name="WmBooth" /&gt; Another disputed scene, when Jaguar Paw and the rest of the captives are used as target practice, was acknowledged by the filmmakers to be invented as a plot device for igniting the chase sequence.&lt;ref name="globalheritagefund"/&gt; Some [[anthropologists]] objected to the presence of a huge pit filled with rotting corpses near the fields of the Maya.&lt;ref name="pack of inaccuracies"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061212/news_1c12mel.html |title=''Apocalypto'' a pack of inaccuracies |publisher=San Diego Union Tribune |author=Mark McGuire |date=December 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen states that this is "conjecture", saying that "all [Gibson was] trying to do there is express the horror of it".&lt;ref name="globalheritagefund"/&gt;

The ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that the famous [[Bonampak]] murals were digitally altered to show a warrior holding a dripping human heart, which is not present in the original.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/08/AR2006120801815_pf.html Culture Shocker], ''Washington Post'', December 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ending===
According to the DVD commentary track by [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Farhad Safinia]], the ending of the film was meant to depict the first contact between the Spaniards and Mayas that took place in 1511 when [[Pedro De Alvarado]] arrived on the coast of the [[Yucatan]] and [[Guatemala]], and also during the fourth voyage of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1502.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.athenapub.com/coluvoy4.htm |title=The Fourth Voyage of Christopher Columbus (1502) |journal=Athena Review |volume=2 |issue=1 |access-date=July 14, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527185333/http://www.athenapub.com/coluvoy4.htm |archive-date=May 27, 2008 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thematic meaning of the arrival of the Europeans is a subject of disagreement. Traci Ardren wrote that the Spanish arrivals were Christian [[missionaries]] and that the film had a "blatantly colonial message that the Mayas needed saving because they were 'rotten at the core.'" According to Ardren, the Gibson film "replays, in glorious big-budget technicolor, an offensive and racist notion that Maya people were brutal to one another long before the arrival of Europeans and thus they deserved, in fact they needed, rescue. This same idea was used for 500 years to justify the subjugation of Maya people."&lt;ref name="Archaeology" /&gt; On the other hand, David van Biema questions whether the Spaniards are portrayed as saviors of the Mayas, since they are depicted ominously and Jaguar Paw decides to return to the woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1570108,00.html |title= What Has Mel Gibson Got Against the Church? | first =David | last = van Biema |work=Time Magazine |date= December 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is supported by the reference of the Oracle Girl to those who would "Scratch out the earth. Scratch you out. And end your world." However, recalling the opening quote to the film ("A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within"), professors David Stuart and Stephen Houston have written the implication is that Postclassic Mayans had become so corrupt that they were "a civilization ... that deserves to die."&lt;ref name="Culture Shocker" /&gt;
