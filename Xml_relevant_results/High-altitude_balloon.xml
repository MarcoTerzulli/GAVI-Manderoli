'''High-altitude balloons''' are manned or unmanned [[balloon]]s, usually filled with [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]], or in some cases [[methane]], that are released into the [[stratosphere]], generally attaining between {{cvt|18|and|37|km|mi ft}} above [[sea level]]. In 2002, a balloon named BU60-1 reached a record [[altitude]] of {{cvt|53.0|km|mi ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/e/special/2003/yamagami/03.shtml |title=Research on Balloon to Float over 50km Altitude |publisher=Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, [[JAXA]] |access-date=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common type of high-altitude balloons are [[weather balloon]]s. Other purposes include use as a platform for experiments in the upper atmosphere. Modern balloons generally contain electronic equipment such as radio [[transmitter]]s, [[camera]]s, or [[satellite navigation]] systems, such as [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers.

These balloons are launched into what is termed "[[near space]]", defined as the area of [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] between the [[Armstrong limit]] ({{cvt|18-19|km|mi}} above sea level), where pressure falls to the point that a human being could not survive without a pressurised suit, and the [[Mesopause]] ({{cvt|85|km|mi}} above sea level), where astrodynamics must take over from aerodynamics in order to maintain flight.

Due to the low cost of GPS and communications equipment, high-altitude ballooning is a popular [[hobby]], with organizations such as UKHAS assisting the development of payloads.&lt;ref name="boing-boing"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boingboing.net/2007/10/26/diy-balloon-sent-up.html |title=DIY balloon sent up 30km |publisher=[[Boing Boing]] |date=26 October 2007 |access-date=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McDermott"&gt;{{cite web |last=McDermott |first=Vincent |url=http://vincentmcdermott.com/2011/08/08/space-race-for-diyers/ |title=Space race for DIYers |work=[[National Post]] |date=8 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228111142/http://vincentmcdermott.com/2011/08/08/space-race-for-diyers/ |archive-date=2013-02-28 |access-date=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The first hydrogen balloon===
In France during 1783, the first public experiment with hydrogen-filled balloons involved [[Jacques Charles]], a French professor of physics, and the [[Robert brothers]], renowned constructors of physics instruments.

Charles provided large [[Hydrogen production|quantities of hydrogen]], which had only been produced in small quantities previously, by mixing {{convert|540|kg|abbr=on}} of iron and {{convert|270|kg|abbr=on}} of [[sulfuric acid]]. The balloon, called Charlière, took 5 days to fill and was launched from [[Champ de Mars]] in Paris where 300,000 people gathered to watch the spectacle. The balloon was launched and rose through the clouds. The expansion of the gas caused the balloon to tear and it descended 45 minutes later {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} away from Paris.&lt;ref&gt;G. Pfotzer, "[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/seri/SSRv./0013//0000198.000.html History of the use of Balloons in Scientific Experiments]", ''Space Science Reviews'' 13:2 pp.200 (1972). Recovered on 11 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manned high-altitude balloons===
Manned high-altitude balloons were used from the 1930s to 1960s for research and in seeking [[flight altitude record]]s.&lt;ref name="spaceflight"&gt;{{cite web|last1=López-Urdiales|first1=José Mariano|title=The Role of Balloons in the Future Development of Space Tourism|url=http://www.pddnet.com/sites/pddnet.com/files/legacyfiles/PDD/News_And_Editorials/Editorials/2010-08/IAC-02-IAA%201%203%2001.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2015|location=Houston, Texas|date=October 19, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable manned high altitude balloon flights include three records set for highest skydive, the first set by [[Joseph Kittinger]] in 1960 at 31,300m for [[Project Excelsior]], followed by [[Felix Baumgartner]] in 2012 at 38,969m for [[Red Bull Stratos]] and most recently [[Alan Eustace]] in 2014 at 41,419m.

==Uses==
Unmanned high-altitude balloons are used as [[research balloon]]s. Common uses include weather balloons, as well as atmospheric and climate research. They are also widely used to collect data and imagery from near space. High-altitude ballooning is used for scientific applications such as [[Submillimetre astronomy#Submillimetre astronomy from near-space|submillimetre astronomy]].

High-altitude balloons have been considered for use in [[telecommunications]]&lt;ref name="wired 2013-06"&gt;{{cite web|last=Levy|first=Steven|title=How Google Will Use High-Flying Balloons to Deliver Internet to the Hinterlands|url=https://www.wired.com/business/2013/06/google_internet_balloons/all/google.com/loon|date=June 14, 2013|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[space tourism]].&lt;ref name="spaceflight"/&gt; Private companies such as [[zero2infinity]] and [[World View Enterprises]] are developing both manned and unmanned high-altitude balloons for scientific research, commercial purposes, and space tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Betancourt|first1=Mark|title=See The World From 100,000 Feet|journal=Air &amp; Space|date=July 2015|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/space/see-world-100000-feet-180955329/|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wall, M. (2014). World View to Loft Experiments on Balloon Test Flights This Year. "Space.com." Retrieved from http://www.space.com/26658-world-view-balloon-research-flights.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[High-altitude platform station]]s have been proposed for applications such as communications relays.

==Amateur high-altitude ballooning==
High-altitude balloons are often flown by students and by amateur groups to altitudes on the order of {{convert|30,000|m|abbr=on}} for both scientific and educational purposes,&lt;ref name="boing-boing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McDermott" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GSBC, [http://community.balloonchallenge.org/t/what-is-a-high-altitude-balloon-hab/678 What is a High Altitude Balloon].

Retrieved August 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and have become popular among educational institutions and enthusiasts as they do not require many resources for conducting launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to High Altitude Balloons |url=http://www.diyspaceexploration.com/introduction-to-high-altitude-balloons/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901013526/http://www.diyspaceexploration.com/introduction-to-high-altitude-balloons/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 September 2013 |website=DIY Space Exploration |accessdate=13 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amateur radio high-altitude ballooning===
Testing radio range is often a large component to these hobbies. [[Amateur radio]] is often used with packet radio to communicate with 1200 [[baud]], using a system called [[Automatic Packet Reporting System]] back to the ground station. Smaller packages called ''micro'' or ''pico'' trackers are also built and run under smaller balloons. These smaller trackers have used [[Morse code]], [[Hellschreiber|Field Hell]], and [[Radioteletype|RTTY]] to transmit their locations and other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amateur Radio Astronomy and weather reporting|url=http://arawr.ca/?page=payload}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded amateur radio high-altitude balloon launches are recorded to have taken place in Finland by the Ilmari program on May 28, 1967, and in Germany in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funkzentrum.de/technik-historie-mainmenu-616/dezmber/7834-06-dezember-1964-erster-ballonstart-mit-amateurfunk-last-in-der-ddr.html 06. Dezember 1964 - Erster Ballonstart mit Amateurfunk-Last in der DDR] (in German), accessed August 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

====ARHAB program====
[[File:near space.jpg|frame|Image of the Earth's horizon taken from {{cvt|26|km|mi}} on an ARHAB flight.]]
'''Amateur radio high-altitude ballooning''' ('''ARHAB''') is the application of analog and digital [[amateur radio]] to [[weather balloon]]s and was the name suggested by Ralph Wallio (amateur radio callsign W0RPK) for this hobby. Often referred to as "The Poorman's Space Program", ARHAB allows amateurs to design functioning models of spacecraft and launch them into a space-like environment. Bill Brown (amateur radio callsign WB8ELK) is considered to have begun the modern ARHAB movement with his first launch of a balloon carrying an amateur radio transmitter on 15 August 1987.

An ARHAB flight consists of a balloon, a recovery parachute, and a payload of one or more packages. The payload normally contains an amateur radio transmitter that permits tracking of the flight to its landing for recovery. Most flights use an [[Automatic Packet Reporting System]] (APRS) tracker which gets its position from a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) receiver and converts it to a digital radio transmission. Other flights may use an analog beacon and are tracked using [[Radio direction finder|radio direction finding]] techniques. Long duration flights frequently must use [[high frequency]] custom built transmitters and slow data protocols such as [[radioteletype]] (RTTY), [[Hellschreiber]], [[Morse code]] and [[PSK31]], to transmit data over great distances using little battery power. Use of amateur radio transmitters on an ARHAB flight requires an amateur radio license, but non-amateur radio transmitters are possible to use without a license.

In addition to the tracking equipment, other payload components may include sensors, data loggers, cameras, [[amateur television]] (ATV) transmitters or other scientific experiments. Some ARHAB flights carry a simplified payload package called [[High-altitude balloon#BalloonSat|BalloonSat]].

A typical ARHAB flight uses a standard latex weather balloon, lasts around 2–3 hours, and reaches {{cvt|25–35|km|mi}} in altitude. Experiments with zero-pressure balloons, superpressure balloons, and valved latex balloons have extended flight times to more than 24 hours. A zero-pressure flight by the [[Spirit of Knoxville|Spirit of Knoxville Balloon Program]] in March 2008 lasted over 40 hours and landed off the coast of Ireland, over {{cvt|5400|km|mi}} from its launch point. On December 11, 2011, the California Near Space Project flight number CNSP-11 with the call sign K6RPT-11 launched a record-breaking flight traveling {{cvt|6,236|mi|km}} from [[San Jose, California]], to a splashdown in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The flight lasted 57 hours and 2 minutes. It became the first successful U.S. transcontinental and the first successful transatlantic amateur radio high-altitude balloon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Amateur Radio Balloon Flight Crosses Atlantic, Sets Records|publisher=[[American Radio Relay League]]|date=2011-12-15|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/amateur-radio-balloon-flight-crosses-atlantic-sets-records|doi=|access-date=2011-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fernandez|first=Lisa|authorlink=|title=Two Silicon Valley high-altitude ballooning groups vie for record|work=[[The Mercury News|San Jose Mercury News]]|date=2011-12-15|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/peninsula/ci_19547555|doi=|access-date=2011-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyle|first=Rebecca|author-link=|title=Amateur Radio Balloon Flies From California to Algeria|work=[[Popular Science]]|date=2011-12-15|url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-12/amateur-radio-balloon-makes-record-transcontinental-transatlantic-flight|doi=|access-date=2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meadows|first=Ron|author-link=|title=CNSP-11, K6RPT-11 Flight information|publisher=California Near Space Project | date=2011-12-12 | url=http://www.californianearspaceproject.com/CNSP-11_info.html|doi=|access-date=2011-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, a number of flights have circumnavigated the Earth using superpressure plastic film balloons. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/balloons-carrying-amateur-radio-payloads-still-circling-earth|title=Balloons Carrying Amateur Radio Payloads Still Circling the Earth|website=www.arrl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/party-balloon-carrying-ham-radio-payload-circles-southern-hemisphere-a-second-time|title=Party Balloon Carrying Ham Radio Payload Circles Southern Hemisphere a Second Time|website=arrl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year in the United States, the Great Plains Super Launch (GPSL) hosts a large gathering of ARHAB groups.

====BEAR program====
[[Balloon Experiments with Amateur Radio]] (BEAR) is a series of Canadian-based high-altitude balloon experiments by a group of Amateur Radio operators and experimenters from Sherwood Park and Edmonton, Alberta. The experiments started in the year 2000 and continued with BEAR-9 in 2012, reaching {{cvt|36.010|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=canadianart&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tousley|first=Nancy|title=Kevin Schmidt: High Hopes|journal=Canadian Art|date=1 March 2012|url=http://www.canadianart.ca/features/2012/03/01/kevin_schmidt/|access-date=8 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501181032/http://canadianart.ca/features/2012/03/01/kevin_schmidt/|archive-date=1 May 2015|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bearsite&gt;{{cite web|last=Sloan|first=Barry|title=BEAR Home Page|url=http://bear.sbszoo.com/|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[balloon]]s are made of [[latex]] filled with either [[helium]] or [[hydrogen]]. All of the BEAR payloads carry a tracking system comprising a [[GPS]] receiver, an [[Automatic Packet Reporting System|APRS]] encoder, and a radio transmitter module. Other experimental payload modules include an [[Amateur Radio]] crossband repeater, and a [[digital camera]], all of which is contained within an insulated foam box suspended below the balloon.

===BalloonSat===
[[File:Balloonsats in flight.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Image of five BalloonSats shortly after launch on an ARHAB flight.]]
A BalloonSat is a simple package designed to carry lightweight experiments into near space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://explorersposts.grc.nasa.gov/post632/Year2004/EP632_OpenHouse.pdf|title=Exporer Scouts 632 BalloonSat slide show|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a popular introduction to engineering principles in some high school and college courses. BalloonSats are carried as secondary payloads on ARHAB flights. One reason BalloonSats are simple is because they do not require the inclusion of tracking equipment; as secondary payloads, they already are being carried by tracking capsules.

Space Grant started the BalloonSat program in August 2000. It was created as a hands on way to introduce new science and engineering students interested in space studies to some fundamental engineering techniques, team working skills and the basics of space and Earth science. The BalloonSat program is part of a course taught by Space Grant at the University of Colorado at Boulder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koehler|first1=Chris|title=BalloonSat: Missions to the Edge of Space|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1947&amp;context=smallsat|website=Utah State University|publisher=16th Annual/USU Conference on Small Satellites|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the design of a BalloonSat is under weight and volume constraints. This encourages good engineering practices, introduces a challenge, and allows for the inclusion of many BalloonSats on an [[ARHAB]] flight. The airframe material is usually [[Styrofoam]] or Foamcore, as they are lightweight, easy to machine, and provide reasonably good insulation.

Most carry sensors, data loggers and small cameras operated by timer circuits. Popular sensors include air temperature, relative humidity, tilt, and acceleration. Experiments carried inside BalloonSats have included such things as captive insects and food items.

Before launch, most BalloonSats are required to undergo testing. These tests are designed to ensure the BalloonSat will function properly and return science results. The tests include a cold soak, drop test, function test, and weighing. The cold soak test simulates the intense cold temperatures the BalloonSat will experience during its mission. A launch and landing can be traumatic, therefore the drop test requires the BalloonSat to hold together and still function after an abrupt drop. The function test verifies the BalloonSat crew can prep the BalloonSat at the launch site.

==Geostationary balloon satellite==

[[File:High Altitude Airship.JPG|thumb|[[High-altitude platform station|High-altitude airship satellite ]] ]]
'''Geostationary balloon satellites''' ('''GBS''') are proposed high-altitute balloons that would float in the [[stratosphere]] ({{convert|60,000|to|70,000|ft|km}} above sea level) at a fixed point over the Earth's surface and thereby act as atmosphere analogues to satellites. At that altitude, [[air density]] is 1/10 of what it is at [[sea level]]. The average wind speed at these levels is less than that at the surface.{{cn|date=January 2017|reason=Is it?}} A propulsion system would allow the balloon to move into and maintain its position. The GBS would be powered with solar panels en route to its location and then receive laser power from a cell tower it hovers over.

A GBS could be used to provide [[broadband Internet access]] over a large area. Laser broadband would connect the GBS to the [[Wide area network|network]], which could then provide a large area of coverage because of its wider line of sight over the curvature of the Earth and unimpeded [[Fresnel zone]].&lt;ref name="ieeexplore"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=A low cost alternative for satellites- tethered ultra-high altitude balloons|publisher=ieeexplore.ieee.org|doi = 10.1109/RAST.2011.5966806|title = Proceedings of 5th International Conference on Recent Advances in Space Technologies - RAST2011|pages = 13–16|year = 2011|last1 = Izet-Unsalan|first1 = Kunsel|last2 = Unsalan|first2 = Deniz|isbn = 978-1-4244-9617-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=books-google&gt;{{cite book|title=The Use of Balloons for Physics and Astronomy|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uDDWjN4DtawC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=what+are+Geostationary+balloon+satellite#v=onepage&amp;q=what%20are%20Geostationary%20balloon%20satellite&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 March 2014|isbn = 9789027726360|last1 = Zee|first1 = Chong-Hung|date = 1989-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=noaasis&gt;{{cite web|title=NOAA's Geostationary and Polar-Orbiting Weather Satellites|url=http://noaasis.noaa.gov/NOAASIS/ml/genlsatl.html|publisher=noaasis.noaa.gov|accessdate=24 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825050114/http://noaasis.noaa.gov/NOAASIS/ml/genlsatl.html|archive-date=25 August 2018|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;
