[[File:Arctic_food_web_degrees_of_separation.svg|thumb|250px|An arctic [[food web]] showing the number of degrees of separation of the animals from phyto-plankton &amp;ndash; for example, capelin are 4 connections away from phyto-plankton]]
'''Six degrees of separation''' is the idea that all people are six, or fewer, social connections away from each other. Also known as the 6 Handshakes rule. As a result, a chain of "[[friend of a friend|a friend of a friend]]" statements can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of six steps. It was originally set out by [[Frigyes Karinthy]] in 1929 and popularized in an eponymous [[Six Degrees of Separation (play)|1990 play]] written by [[John Guare]]. It is sometimes generalized to the average [[Path length|social distance]] being [[logarithm]]ic in the size of the population.

== Early conceptions ==

=== Shrinking world ===
Theories on optimal design of cities, city traffic flows, neighborhoods, and demographics were in vogue after [[World War I]]. These{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;!--What does statism have to do with this? Has some paranoic Libertarian been at work even here? ... Formally, I'm requesting a citation for the claim that the Karinthy story is connected to "statism" in city design.--&gt; conjectures were expanded in 1929 by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] author [[Frigyes Karinthy]], who published a volume of short stories titled ''Everything is Different.'' One of these pieces was titled "Chains," or "Chain-Links." The story investigated{{snd}} in abstract, conceptual, and fictional terms{{snd}} many of the problems that would captivate future generations of mathematicians, sociologists, and physicists within the field of network theory.&lt;ref name=newman&gt;Newman, Mark, Albert-László Barabási, and Duncan J. Watts. 2006. ''The Structure and Dynamics of Networks.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bara/&gt; Due to technological advances in communications and travel, friendship networks could grow larger and span greater distances. In particular, Karinthy believed that the modern world was 'shrinking' due to this ever-increasing connectedness of human beings. He posited that despite great physical distances between the globe's individuals, the growing density of human networks made the actual social distance far smaller.&lt;ref&gt;[https://djjr-courses.wdfiles.com/local--files/soc180%3Akarinthy-chain-links/Karinthy-Chain-Links_1929.pdf Karinthy, Frigyes. (1929) "Chain Links."]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this hypothesis, Karinthy's characters believed that any two individuals could be connected through at most five acquaintances. In his story, the characters create a game out of this notion. He wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A fascinating game grew out of this discussion. One of us suggested performing the following experiment to prove that the population of the Earth is closer together now than they have ever been before. We should select any person from the 1.5 billion inhabitants of the Earth – anyone, anywhere at all. He bet us that, using no more than ''five'' individuals, one of whom is a personal acquaintance, he could contact the selected individual using nothing except the network of personal acquaintances.&lt;ref name=karinthy&gt;Karinthy, Frigyes. ''Chain-Links.'' Translated from Hungarian and annotated by Adam Makkai and Enikö Jankó.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This idea both directly and indirectly influenced a great deal of early thought on [[social network]]s. Karinthy has been regarded as the originator of the notion of six degrees of separation.&lt;ref name=bara&gt;[http://www.nd.edu/~alb/ Barabási, Albert-László] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050304041427/http://www.nd.edu/~alb/ |date=2005-03-04 }}. 2003. ''[http://www.nd.edu/%7Enetworks/Linked/index.html Linked: How Everything is Connected to Everything Else and What It Means for Business, Science, and Everyday Life.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103151518/http://www.nd.edu/%7Enetworks/Linked/index.html |date=2007-01-03 }}'' New York: Plume.&lt;/ref&gt;
A related theory deals with the quality of connections, rather than their existence. The theory of [[three degrees of influence]] was created by Nicholas A. Christakis and James H. Fowler.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

=== Small world ===
{{Main|Small-world experiment}}
Michael Gurevich conducted seminal work in his empirical study of the structure of social networks in his 1961 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] PhD dissertation under [[Ithiel de Sola Pool]].&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich, M (1961) The Social Structure of Acquaintanceship Networks, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematician [[Manfred Kochen]], an Austrian who had been involved in urban design, extrapolated these empirical results in a mathematical manuscript, ''[[Contacts and Influences]]'',&lt;ref&gt;de Sola Pool, Ithiel, Kochen, Manfred (1978–1979)."Contacts and influence." ''Social Networks'' 1(1): 42&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that in a U.S.-sized population without social structure, "it is practically certain that any two individuals can contact one another by means of at most two intermediaries. In a [socially] structured population it is less likely but still seems probable. And perhaps for the whole world's population, probably only one more bridging individual should be needed." They subsequently constructed [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] simulations based on Gurevich's data, which recognized that both weak and strong acquaintance links are needed to model social structure. The simulations, carried out on the relatively limited computers of 1973, were nonetheless able to predict that a more realistic three degrees of separation existed across the U.S. population, foreshadowing the findings of American psychologist [[Stanley Milgram]].{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

Milgram continued Gurevich's experiments in acquaintanceship networks at [[Harvard University]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. Kochen and de Sola Pool's manuscript, ''Contacts and Influences'',&lt;ref&gt;de Sola Pool, Ithiel, Kochen, Manfred (1978–1979)."Contacts and Influence." ''Social Networks'' 1(1): 5–51&lt;/ref&gt; was conceived while both were working at the [[University of Paris]] in the early 1950s, during a time when Milgram visited and collaborated in their research. Their unpublished manuscript circulated among academics for over 20 years before publication in 1978. It formally articulated the mechanics of social networks, and explored the mathematical consequences of these (including the degree of connectedness). The manuscript left many significant questions about networks unresolved, and one of these was the number of degrees of separation in actual social networks. Milgram took up the challenge on his return from [[Paris]], leading to the experiments reported in ''The Small World Problem'' &lt;ref name="Stanley Milgram 1968"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Milgram | first1 = Stanley | year = 1967 | title = The Small World Problem | url = | journal = Psychology Today | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 60–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in popular science journal ''[[Psychology Today]]'', with a more rigorous version of the paper appearing in [[Social Psychology Quarterly|Sociometry]] two years later.&lt;ref&gt;Travers, Jeffrey, and Stanley Milgram, [http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns/teaching/NetworkedLife/travers_milgram.pdf "An Experimental Study of the Small World Problem"], Sociometry 32(4, Dec. 1969):425–443&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Psychology Today'' article generated enormous publicity for the experiments, which are well known today, long after much of the formative work has been forgotten.

Milgram's article made famous&lt;ref name="Stanley Milgram 1968" /&gt; his 1967 set of experiments to investigate de Sola Pool and Kochen's "small world problem." Mathematician [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], born in [[Warsaw]], growing up in [[Poland]] then [[France]], was aware of the Statist [[rule of thumb]], and was also a colleague of de Sola Pool, Kochen and Milgram at the University of Paris during the early 1950s (Kochen brought Mandelbrot to work at the Institute for Advanced Study and later IBM in the U.S.). This circle of researchers was fascinated by the interconnectedness and "social capital" of human networks. Milgram's study results showed that people in the [[United States]] seemed to be connected by approximately three friendship links, on average, without speculating on global linkages; he never actually used the term "six degrees of separation." Since the ''Psychology Today'' article gave the experiments wide publicity, Milgram, Kochen, and [[Karinthy]] all had been incorrectly attributed as the origin of the notion of six degrees; the most likely popularizer of the term "six degrees of separation" would be [[John Guare]], who attributed the value '6' to [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]].&lt;ref name=SDS-R-01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/exhibitions/peggy-bacon|title= The concept of Six degrees of separation stretches back to Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi |accessdate=16 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued research: Small World Project ===
In 2003, [[Columbia University]] conducted an analogous experiment on social connectedness amongst Internet email users. Their effort was named the Columbia Small World Project, and included 24,163 e-mail chains, aimed at 18 targets from 13 countries.&lt;ref name="dodds"&gt;Dodds, Muhamad, Watts (2003)."Small World Project," Science Magazine. pp.827-829, 8 August 2003 https://www.sciencemag.org/content/301/5634/827&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 100,000 people registered, but only 384 (0.4%) reached the final target. Amongst the successful chains, while shorter lengths were more common some reached their target after only 7, 8, 9 or 10 steps. Dodds et al. noted that participants (all of whom volunteers) were strongly biased towards existing models of Internet users{{#tag:ref|"More than half of all participants resided in North America and were middle class, professional, college educated, and Christian, reflecting commonly held notions of the Internet-using population"&lt;ref name="dodds"/&gt;|group=Note}} and that connectedness based on professional ties was much stronger than those within families or friendships. The authors cite "lack of interest" as the predominating factor in the high attrition rate,{{#tag:ref|"suggesting lack of interest ... was the main reason" for the "extremely low completion rate"&lt;ref name="dodds"/&gt;|group=Note}} a finding consistent with earlier studies.&lt;ref name="kleinfeld"/&gt;

== Research ==
Several studies, such as [[Small world experiment|Milgram's small world experiment]], have been conducted to measure this connectedness empirically. The phrase "six degrees of separation" is often used as a synonym for the idea of the "small world" phenomenon.&lt;ref name=AFC-NA-21&gt;[[Steven Strogatz]], [[Duncan J. Watts]] and [[Albert-László Barabási]] {{cite web |first =  |last =  |title =  explaining synchronicity, network theory, adaption of complex systems, Six Degrees, Small world phenomenon in the BBC Documentary |work = BBC  |url=http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/six-degrees-of-separation/|page =  |accessdate=11 June 2012}} "Unfolding the science behind the idea of six degrees of separation"&lt;/ref&gt;

However, detractors argue that Milgram's experiment did not demonstrate such a link,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/more_or_less/5176698.stm BBC News: More Or Less: Connecting With People In Six Steps] 13 July 2006, "Judith Kleinfeld ... told us, that 95% of the letters sent out had failed to reach the target."&lt;/ref&gt; and the "six degrees" claim has been decried as an "academic [[urban myth]]".&lt;ref name="kleinfeld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~fienberg/Stat36-835/Kleinfeld_SWP.pdf|title=The Small World Problem|publisher=[[Society (journal)|Society (Springer)]], Social Science and Public Policy|author=[[Judith Kleinfeld|Judith S. Kleinfeld]], [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]]|date=January–February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pt2002"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200203/six-degrees-urban-myth|magazine=Psychology Today|date=March 1, 2002|title=Six Degrees: Urban Myth? Replicating the small world of Stanley Milgram. Can you reach anyone through a chain of six people.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the existence of isolated groups of humans, for example the [[Korubo people|Korubo]] and other native Brazilian populations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/uncontacted-brazil The Uncontacted Indians of Brazil] Survivalinternational&lt;/ref&gt; would tend to invalidate the strictest interpretation of the hypothesis.

===Computer networks===
In 2001, [[Duncan Watts]], a professor at [[Columbia University]], attempted to recreate Milgram's experiment on the Internet, using an e-mail message as the "package" that needed to be delivered, with 48,000 senders and 19 targets (in 157 countries). Watts found that the average (though not maximum) number of intermediaries was around six.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Duncan J Watts, Steven H Strogatz |year=1998 |title=Collective dynamics of 'small-world' networks |journal=Nature |pages=440–442 |doi=10.1038/30918 |pmid=9623998 |volume=393 |issue=6684|bibcode=1998Natur.393..440W }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2007 study by [[Jure Leskovec]] and [[Eric Horvitz]] examined a data set of instant messages composed of 30 billion conversations among 240 million people. They found the average path length among Microsoft Messenger users to be 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| arxiv=0803.0939| title=Planetary-Scale Views on an Instant-Messaging Network| author=Jure Leskovec and Eric Horvitz|date=June 2007| bibcode=2008arXiv0803.0939L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested by some commentators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masternewmedia.org/news/2006/03/20/the_power_of_open_participatory.htm|title=The Power Of Open Participatory Media And Why Mass Media Must Be Abandoned|author=Robin Good|work=Robin Good's Master New Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; that interlocking networks of computer mediated lateral communication could diffuse single messages to all interested users worldwide as per the 6 degrees of separation principle via Information Routing Groups, which are networks specifically designed to exploit this principle and lateral diffusion.

===An optimal algorithm to calculate degrees of separation in social networks===
Bakhshandeh ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Reza Bakhshandeh, Mehdi Samadi, Zohreh Azimifar, Jonathan Schaeffer, "[http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SOCS/SOCS11/paper/view/4031 Degrees of Separation in Social Networks]", Fourth Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Search, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; have addressed the search problem of identifying the degree of separation between two users in social networks such as Twitter. They have introduced new search techniques to provide optimal or near optimal solutions. The experiments are performed using Twitter, and they show an improvement of several orders of magnitude over greedy approaches. Their optimal algorithm finds an average degree of separation of 3.43 between two random Twitter users, requiring an average of only 67 requests for information over the Internet to Twitter. A near-optimal solution of length 3.88 can be found by making an average of 13.3 requests.

== Popularization ==
No longer limited strictly to academic or philosophical thinking, the notion of six degrees recently has become influential throughout [[popular culture]]. Further advances in communication technology – and particularly the Internet – have drawn great attention to social networks and human interconnectedness. As a result, many popular media sources have addressed the term. The following provide a brief outline of the ways such ideas have shaped popular culture.

===Popularization of offline practice===

====John Guare's ''Six Degrees of Separation''====
{{Main|Six Degrees of Separation (play)|Six Degrees of Separation (film)}}
American playwright [[John Guare]] wrote a play in 1990 and released a 1993 film that popularized it; it is Guare's most widely known work. {{Citation needed|date = July 2016}} The play ruminates upon the idea that any two individuals are connected by at most five others. As one of the characters states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I read somewhere that everybody on this planet is separated by only six other people. Six degrees of separation between us and everyone else on this planet. The President of the United States, a gondolier in Venice, just fill in the names. I find it A) extremely comforting that we're so close, and B) like [[Chinese water torture]] that we're so close because you have to find the right six people to make the right connection... I am bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six people.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;Memorable quotes from ''Six Degrees of Separation.'' Accessed Nov. 11, 2006 from [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108149/quotes IMDB.com].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Guare, in interviews, attributed his awareness of the "six degrees" to Marconi.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}} Although this idea had been circulating in various forms for decades, it is Guare's piece that is most responsible for popularizing the phrase "six degrees of separation."{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}} Following Guare's lead, many future television and film sources would later incorporate the notion into their stories.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

[[J. J. Abrams]], the executive producer of television series ''[[Six Degrees]]'' and ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', played the role of Doug in the film adaptation of this play.{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}} Many of the play's themes are apparent in his television shows (see below).{{Citation needed|date = July 2016}}

====Kevin Bacon game====
The game "[[Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon]]"&lt;ref name=SDS-T-02&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/8704891/Six-degrees-of-separation-theory-tested-on-Facebook.html|title=Six degrees of separation' theory tested on Facebook|work=Telegraph|accessdate=7 May 2012|date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was invented as a play on the concept: the goal is to link any actor to [[Kevin Bacon]] through no more than six connections, where two actors are connected if they have appeared in a movie or commercial together. It was created by three students at [[Albright College]] in Pennsylvania,&lt;ref name=SDS-T-03&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8560483/Actors-Hollywood-career-spawned-Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon.html|title=Actor's Hollywood career spawned 'Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon'|work=Telegraph|accessdate=7 May 2012|date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who came up with the concept while watching ''[[Footloose (1984 film)|Footloose]]''. On September 13, 2012, Google made it possible to search for any given actor's 'Bacon Number' through their search engine.

Upon the arrival of the 4G mobile network in the United Kingdom, Kevin Bacon appears in several commercials for the [[EE (telecommunications company)|EE]] Network in which he links himself to several well known celebrities and TV shows in the UK.

====John L. Sullivan====
An early version involved former world Heavyweight boxing champion, [[John L. Sullivan]], in which people would ask others to "shake the hand that shook the hand that shook the hand that shook the hand of 'the great John L.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/component/content/article/41-articles-of-2005/1514-the-great-john-l-sullivan |title=The Great John L.

* The Israeli TV program ''Cultural Attache'', presented by [[Dov Alfon]], is based on the concept of Six Degrees of Separation. The first guest is asked to name a cultural figure with which he has an unexpected connection, and this person is interviewed and gives yet another name as connection, till the 6th person on the show, who is then asked about a possible connection to the first guest. Such connection is found in about 50% of the interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Israel's Channel 2 website [http://www.rashut2.org.il/prod_self.asp?pgId=18625&amp;sttsId=3&amp;year=2005&amp;catId=100&amp;arc=1] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]])&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Jorden runt på 6 steg]]'' is a three-episode infotainment series produced by [[Nexiko Media]] which aired in Swedish [[Kanal 5 (Sweden)|Kanal 5]] in 2015. For each episode, hosts [[Filip Hammar and Fredrik Wikingsson]] selected one random person (in [[Bolivia]], [[Nepal]] and [[Senegal]]) and traced their relationships to three respective celebrities: [[Leif G. W. Persson]], [[Gordon Ramsay]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] within a week of travelling. They reached Persson within seven steps, and Ramsay and Aldrin within six steps. The second season features [[Michael Bolton]], [[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[Pamela Anderson]], and [[Charlie Sheen]].
* ''[[Jorden rundt på seks steg]]'' is an ongoing Norwegian TV-series produced by NRK. In each episode, a pair of Norwegian celebrities are placed in one of the world's most remote areas and from there, asked to get in touch with a certain celebrity through a chain of six people. They are usually successful: In Season 1, three out of six pairs managed to get to their chosen celebrity in six steps; two of the pairs managed it in seven, and one pair managed it in five. In Season 2, all six pairs reached their target in six steps. https://tv.nrk.no/serie/jorden-rundt-paa-seks-steg

===Website and application===
==== Internet ====
In 2013, Hungarian physicist [[Albert-László Barabási]] discovered that, on average, there are 19 degrees of separation between any two web pages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcworld.com/article/2028714/any-two-web-pages-are-separated-by-just-19-clicks-study-finds.html /any two web pages are separated by just 19 clicks study finds]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Six Degrees of Wikipedia ====
In late February 2018, the website [https://www.sixdegreesofwikipedia.com www.SixDegreesOfWikipedia.com] was published by Jacob Wenger. This site takes any two Wikipedia articles and finds the various hyperlink paths that interconnect the two in the least number of clicks. It then shows each of the steps that were taken to do so and also presents a graphical display of the connections. On March 14, 2018, the site stated that among searches up to that date (~half a million), there have been an average separation of 3.0190°. From these, the number of searches that required six or more degrees was 1.417 percent. It also stated that searches with no connection found was 1.07%, and this was attributed to certain articles being dead ends or having very few links.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sixdegreesofwikipedia.com/blog/search-results-analysis Insights On Hitler And More From The First 500,000 Searches] by Jacob Wenger, March 14, 2018 (Searches with the same start and end page were not included in this average, and neither were articles in which no connection was found.)&lt;/ref&gt; (Wenger's open source code is available on GitHub, and this enabled other sites to copy the concept, such as [http://degreesofwikipedia.com/ degreesofwikipedia.com].)

==== Facebook ====
A [[Facebook]] platform application named "Six Degrees" was developed by Karl Bunyan, which calculates the degrees of separation between people. It had over 5.8 million users, as seen from the group's page. The average separation for all users of the application is 5.73 degrees, whereas the maximum degree of separation is 12. The application has a "Search for Connections" window to input any name of a [[Facebook]] user, to which it then shows the chain of connections. In June 2009, Bunyan shut down the application, presumably due to issues with Facebook's caching policy; specifically, the policy prohibited the storing of friend lists for more than 24 hours, which would have made the application inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.karlbunyan.com/2009/06/24/six-degrees-come-in-your-time-is-up/|title=Six Degrees: come in, your time is up|work=K! - the blog of Karl Bunyan}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new version of the application became available at Six Degrees after Karl Bunyan gave permission to a group of developers led by Todd Chaffee to re-develop the application based on Facebook's revised policy on caching data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.facebook.com/sixdegreesearch|title=Six Degrees on Facebook - Facebook|work=facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidefacebook.com/2010/04/21/facebook-removing-24-hour-caching-policy-on-user-data-for-developers/|title=Facebook Removing 24 Hour Caching Policy on User Data for Developers|work=insidefacebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial version of the application was built at a Facebook Developers Garage London [[hackathon]] with [[Mark Zuckerberg]] in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.mikamai.co.uk/2010/06/mikamai-participates-with-zuck-in-london-facebook-hackathon/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707013246/http://blog.mikamai.co.uk/2010/06/mikamai-participates-with-zuck-in-london-facebook-hackathon/ |archivedate=2012-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yahoo! Research Small World Experiment has been conducting an experiment and everyone with a Facebook account can take part in it. According to the research page, this research has the potential of resolving the still unresolved theory of six degrees of separation.&lt;ref name=SDS-T-02/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smallworld.sandbox.yahoo.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926141619/http://smallworld.sandbox.yahoo.com/ |archivedate=2011-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook's data team released two papers in November 2011 which document that amongst all Facebook users at the time of research (721 million users with 69 billion friendship links) there is an average distance of 4.74.&lt;ref name=SDS-T-01&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/8906693/Facebook-cuts-six-degrees-of-separation-to-four.html|title=Facebook cuts six degrees of separation to four|work=Telegraph|accessdate=7 May 2012|first=Emma|last=Barnett|date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="facebook2016" /&gt; Probabilistic algorithms were applied on statistical metadata to verify the accuracy of the measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1111.4570|title=Four Degrees of Separation|last=Backstrom|first=Lars |author2=Boldi, Paolo |author3=Rosa, Marco |author4=Ugander, Johan |author5=Vigna, Sebastiano|date=2011-11-19|class=cs.SI}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also found that 99.91% of Facebook users were interconnected, forming a large connected component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1111.4503|title=The Anatomy of the Facebook Social Graph|last=Ugander|first=Johan|author2=Karrer, Brian |author3=Backstrom, Lars |author4= Marlow, Cameron |class=cs.SI|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== LinkedIn ====
The [[LinkedIn]] professional networking site operates the degree of separation one is away from a person with which he or she wishes to communicate. On [[LinkedIn]], one's network is made up of 1st-degree, 2nd-degree, and 3rd-degree connections and fellow members of LinkedIn Groups. In addition, LinkedIn notifies the user how many connections they and any other user have in common.

==== SixDegrees.com ====
[[SixDegrees.com]] was an early social-networking website that existed from 1997 to 2001. It allowed users to list friends, family members and acquaintances, send messages and post bulletin board items to people in their first, second, and third degrees, and see their connection to any other user on the site. At its height, it had 3,500,000 fully registered members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kirkpatrick |first1=David |title=The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company That Is Connecting the World | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster

==== Twitter ====
Users on Twitter can follow other users creating a network. According to a study of 5.2 billion such relationships by social media monitoring firm [[Sysomos]], the average distance on Twitter is 4.67. On average, about 50% of people on Twitter are only four steps away from each other, while nearly everyone is five steps or less away.&lt;ref&gt;Apr 30, 2010, [http://www.sysomos.com/insidetwitter/sixdegrees/ Six Degrees of Separation, Twitter Style], from [[Sysomos]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In another work, researchers have shown that the average distance of 1,500 random users in Twitter is 3.435. They calculated the distance between each pair of users using all the active users in Twitter.&lt;ref name=bakhsh&gt;Reza Bakhshandeh, Mehdi Samadi, Zohreh Azimifar, Jonathan Schaeffer ''[http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SOCS/SOCS11/paper/view/4031 Degrees of Separation in Social Networks.]'' Fourth Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Search, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
Mathematicians use an analogous notion of ''[[collaboration distance]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html|title=MR: Collaboration Distance|work=ams.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; two persons are linked if they are coauthors of an article. The collaboration distance with mathematician Paul Erdős is called the [[Erdős number]]. [[Erdős-Bacon number]]s and Erdős-Bacon-Sabbath (EBS) numbers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://erdosbaconsabbath.com/|title=EBS Project|work=erdosbaconsabbath.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724075829/http://erdosbaconsabbath.com/|archivedate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; are further extensions of the same thinking.

[[Watts and Strogatz model|Watts and Strogatz]] showed that the average path length between two nodes in a [[random network]] is equal to {{math|ln ''N'' / ln ''K''}}, where {{math|''N''}} = total nodes and {{math|''K''}} = acquaintances per node. Thus if
{{math|''N''}} = 300,000,000 (90% of the US population) and {{math|''K''}} = 30 then ''Degrees of Separation'' = 19.5 / 3.4 = 5.7 and if {{math|''N''}} = 6,000,000,000 (90% of the World population) and {{math|''K''}} = 30 then ''Degrees of Separation'' = 22.5 / 3.4 = 6.6.
(Assume 10% of population is too young to participate.)

==Psychology==
A 2007 article published in ''The Industrial-Organizational Psychologist'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siop.org/tip/Oct07/Sheridan%20PDFs/452_029to035.pdf (Michel, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; by Jesse S. Michel from Michigan State University, applied Stanley Milgram's small world phenomenon (i.e., “small world problem”) to the field of [[Industrial and organizational psychology|I-O psychology]] through co-author publication linkages. Following six criteria, Scott Highhouse (Bowling Green State University professor and fellow of the Society of Industrial and Organizational Psychology) was chosen as the target. Co-author publication linkages were determined for (1) top authors within the I-O community, (2) quasi-random faculty members of highly productive I-O programs in North America, and (3) publication trends of the target. Results suggest that the small world phenomenon is alive and well with mean linkages of 3.00 to top authors, mean linkages of 2.50 to quasi-random faculty members, and a relatively broad and non-repetitive set of co-author linkages for the target. The author then provided a series of implications and suggestions for future research.
