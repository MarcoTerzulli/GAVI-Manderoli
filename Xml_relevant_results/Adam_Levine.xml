'''Adam Noah Levine''' (born March 18, 1979) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, record producer, entrepreneur, and actor from California. He is the lead singer for the [[pop rock]] band [[Maroon 5]]. Born and raised in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], Levine began his musical career in 1994, when he co-founded the band Kara's Flowers, of which he was the lead vocalist and guitarist. The band split up after their only album, ''[[The Fourth World (album)|The Fourth World]]'' (released in 1997), which did not gain popularity. In 2001, the group was reformed – with guitarist [[James Valentine (musician)|James Valentine]] joining the line-up – and began a new musical chapter, changing their name to Maroon 5. In 2002, the band released their first album, ''[[Songs About Jane]]'', which went multi-platinum in the US. Since then, they have released five more albums: ''[[It Won't Be Soon Before Long]]'' (2007), ''[[Hands All Over (album)|Hands All Over]]'' (2010), ''[[Overexposed (album)|Overexposed]]'' (2012), ''[[V (Maroon 5 album)|V]]'' (pronounced: "five")&lt;!--WARNING!, Do not remove this sentence--&gt; (2014), and ''[[Red Pill Blues]]'' (2017). As part of Maroon 5, Levine has received three [[Grammy Award]]s, three [[American Music Award]]s, an [[MTV Video Music Award]], and a [[World Music Awards|World Music Award]].

From 2011 to 2019, Levine served as a coach on [[NBC]]'s reality talent show ''[[The Voice (American TV series)|The Voice]]'' and won three times with a member of his team (seasons [[The Voice (American season 1)|1]], [[The Voice (American season 5)|5]], and [[The Voice (American season 9)|9]]). In 2012, Levine made his acting debut as a recurring character Leo Morrison in ''[[American Horror Story: Asylum]]'', the second season of the series ''[[American Horror Story]]''. Levine also appeared in the films ''[[Begin Again (film)|Begin Again]]'' (2013), ''[[Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping]]'' (2016), ''[[Fun Mom Dinner]]'' and ''[[The Clapper (film)|The Clapper]]'' (both 2017). As an entrepreneur, Levine launched his own eponymous fragrance line in 2013. The same year, he collaborated with [[Kmart|K-Mart]] and ShopYourWay.com to develop his menswear collection. He also owns a record label, [[222 Records]], and a production company, 222 Productions (which the latter produced ''[[Sugar (2018 TV series)|Sugar]]'' and ''[[Songland]]'', respectively). In 2013, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' reported that "sources familiar with his many business dealings" estimated Levine would earn more than $35&amp;nbsp;million that year.&lt;ref name=lacey&gt;{{cite news | last=Rose| first=Lacey| title=Inside Adam Levine's $35 Million-Plus a Year Empire| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/adam-levine-the-voice-maroon-5-426002?page=show| work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]| accessdate=March 16, 2013|date=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allen, along with his partner [[John DeNicola]], had the band record an 11-track album.&lt;ref name=kimpel/&gt; Owing to a string of industry showcases in Los Angeles, they were signed on to [[Reprise Records]] through producer [[Rob Cavallo]].&lt;ref name=thompson&gt;{{cite web | last=Thompson| first=Stephen| title=Kara's Flowers – The Fourth World| url=https://www.avclub.com/articles/karas-flowers-the-fourth-world,20949/| website=[[The A.V.

By 2006, the band started recording once again, and in May 2007, Maroon 5's second album ''[[It Won't Be Soon Before Long]]'' was released.

After winding down from a [[It Won't Be Soon Before Long Tour|world tour]] in support of ''It Won't Be Soon Before Long'', the band began recording in Switzerland in 2009, in collaboration with record producer and songwriter [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange]].

[[File:Adam Levine2.JPG|thumb|left|Levine performing at the opening night of the Honda Civic Tour 2013]]

In 2014, Maroon 5 continued their collaboration with [[Ryan Tedder]], [[Max Martin]] and others to release their fifth studio album ''[[V (Maroon 5 album)|V]]'' (pronounced: "five"). Levine acknowledged that they followed the same song-writing process that they tried with ''Overexposed'', saying: "We developed a really nice system on the last record — we found songs we were passionate about, developed them and put our stamp on them [...] this time we kept it going but looked for different types of songs."&lt;ref name=mwood&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Mikael|title=Adam Levine talks Maroon 5's 'V,' 'The Voice,' Proactiv, more|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-conversation-adam-levine-20140831-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=June 18, 2015|date=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five singles were released from it.

Levine remembers that listening to "[[Are You That Somebody?]]" by [[Aaliyah]] convinced him to pursue a more soulful sound than that of the band he was performing with at the time, Kara's Flowers.&lt;ref name=appleford/&gt; His move to New York introduced him to a new music scene that involved [[hip-hop]], [[R&amp;B]], [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[soul music]].&lt;ref name=studiocitysun/&gt; He took to changing his musical style, extensively emulating Stevie Wonder.&lt;ref name=michelson/&gt; Subsequently, ''Songs About Jane'' was released, deemed  "bluesy funk"&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=MacKenzie|title=Songs About Jane -Maroon 5 review|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/songs-about-jane-mw0000219815|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar to the sound of English [[pop rock]] band [[Busted (band)|Busted]].&lt;ref name="sullivan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Caroline|title=Maroon 5, Songs About Jane|date=December 5, 2003| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/dec/05/popandrock.shopping6|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also drew comparisons between Levine and [[Jamiroquai]] singer [[Jay Kay]].&lt;ref name=hoard&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoard|first=Christian|title=Maroon 5 – Songs About Jane|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/songs-about-jane-20030311|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=September 1, 2013|date=March 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I haven't figured out a way to use everything yet. As a songwriter, I'm still limited to that one thing."&lt;ref name="appleford" /&gt; He also claims he does not like mincing words, stating in a ''Rolling Stone'' interview: "I was so sick of typical lyrics like 'Ooh, baby' and 'I love you' and all this vague shit.

==Personal life==
In early 2010, while performing at the ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' Swimsuit Issue release party in Las Vegas, Levine met Russian ''Sports Illustrated'' swimsuit cover-model [[Anne Vyalitsyna]].
