The project was rumored to be approved by Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]] in late 2014 and assigned to Vice President Steve Zadesky, a former [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] engineer as project in-charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Chuck |last = Jones |date = February 14, 2015 |title = Hitting the Brakes on Apple's Electric Car |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2015/02/14/hitting-the-brakes-on-apples-electric-car/ |access-date = February 19, 2015 |work = [[Forbes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the project, Apple was rumored to have hired Johann Jungwirth, the former-president and chief executive of [[Mercedes-Benz]] Research and Development North America, as well as at least one transmission engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Will |last = Flanagan |date = February 13, 2015 |title = A Titanic Announcement: Apple's Making Cars |url = http://chicagoinno.streetwise.co/2015/02/13/apple-cars-everything-you-need-to-know-about-project-titan/ |access-date = February 19, 2015 |work = Chicago Inno }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Jordan |last = Kahn |date = February 19, 2015 |title = Revealed: The Experts Apple Hired to Build an Electric Car |url = http://9to5mac.com/2015/02/19/apple-electric-car-team/ |access-date = February 25, 2015 |work = [[9to5Mac]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Tim |last = Higgins |agency = Bloomberg News |date = February 17, 2015 |title = Apple Uniquely Positioned to Be Car Company |url = http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/2015/02/16/apple-car-business/23533933/ |access-date = February 19, 2015 |work = [[The Detroit News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1 = Edward |last1 = Taylor |first2 = Alexei |last2 = Oreskovic |last-author-amp = yes |date = February 14, 2015 |title = Apple Studies Self-Driving Car, Auto Industry Source Says |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/14/us-apple-autos-idUSKBN0LI0IJ20150214 |access-date = February 19, 2015 |publisher = [[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, Apple board member [[Mickey Drexler]] stated that Apple co-founder and CEO [[Steve Jobs]] had plans to design and build a car, and that discussions about the concept surfaced around the time that [[Tesla Motors]] debuted [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|its first car]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = Sam |last = Colt |date = February 9, 2015 |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/mickey-drexler-steve-jobs-was-gonna-design-an-icar-2015-2 |title = Apple Board Member: 'Steve Jobs Was Gonna Design an iCar' |work = [[Business Insider]] |access-date = March 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Former Apple [[iPod]] Senior VP [[Tony Fadell]] confirmed that Steve Jobs was interested in an Apple car back in 2008, shortly after the original iPhone was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-11-04/steve-jobs-considered-building-an-apple-car-in-2008 |title = Steve Jobs Considered Building an Apple Car in 2008 |first = Adam |last = Satariano |date = November 4, 2015 |work = Bloomberg.com |accessdate = January 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Apple investor [[Carl Icahn]] stated that he believed rumors that Apple would enter the automobile market in 2020, and that logically Apple would view this car as "the ultimate [[mobile device]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-18/here-s-why-carl-icahn-thinks-apple-will-surge-to-240-per-share |title = Here's Why Carl Icahn Thinks Apple Will Surge to $240 per Share |first = Luke |last = Kawa |date = May 18, 2015 |work = Bloomberg.com |accessdate = May 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://carlicahn.com/carl-icahn-issues-open-letter-to-tim-cook/ |title = Carl Icahn Issues Open Letter to Tim Cook |first = Carl C. |last = Icahn |date = May 18, 2015 |accessdate = February 9, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that Apple were meeting with officials from [[GoMentum Station]],&lt;ref name="guardian-2015-08-14"/&gt; a testing ground for connected and autonomous vehicles at the former [[Concord Naval Weapons Station]] in [[Concord, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://gomentumstation.net/vision/ |title = Vision: GoMentum Station |accessdate = August 14, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, there were reports that Apple were meeting with self-driving car experts from the [[California Department of Motor Vehicles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/18/apple-meets-california-officials-self-driving-car |title = Apple Meets California Officials to Discuss Self-Driving Car |first = Mark |last = Harris |date = September 18, 2015 |work = The Guardian |location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.techinsider.io/apple-looks-to-get-autonomous-permit-in-california-2015-9 |title = One Big Sign the Apple Self-Driving Car Is Closer than We Thought |first = Cadie |last = Thompson |work = Tech Insider }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2015/09/18/more-evidence-unearthed-that-apple-is-working-on.html |title = More Evidence Unearthed that Apple Is Working on Driverless Car |first = Angela |last = Swartz |date = September 18, 2015 |work = [[San Jose Business Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://thenextweb.com/apple/2015/09/19/apples-meeting-with-california-dmv-suggests-a-driverless-car-could-be-on-the-way/ |title = Apple's Meeting with California DMV Suggests a Driverless Car Could Be on the Way |first = Jackie |last = Dove |work = The Next Web |date = September 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Wall Street Journal'' in September 2015, it will be a [[battery electric vehicle]], initially lacking full [[autonomous driving]] capability, with a possible unveiling around 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nasdaq.com/article/apple-speeds-up-electriccar-effort-sees-2019-shipments-20150921-00713 |title = Apple Speeds Up Electric-Car Effort, Sees 2019 Shipments |first = Daisuke |last = Wakabayashi |date = September 21, 2015 |work = WSJ |accessdate = September 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/09/21/report-apples-electric-car-arriving-2019/72571316/ |title = Report: Apple's Electric Car Arriving in 2019 |date = September 21, 2015 |work = USA Today |accessdate = September 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.macworld.com/article/2985155/car-tech/report-apples-electric-car-to-hit-the-road-in-2019-but-it-wont-be-driverless.html |title = Report: Apple's Electric Car to Hit the Road in 2019 but It Won't Be Driverless |first = Oscar |last = Raymundo |date = September 21, 2015 |work = Macworld |accessdate = September 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, Tim Cook stated about the car industry that: "It would seem like there will be massive change in that industry, massive change. You may not agree with that. That's what I think..."We'll see what we do in the future. I do think that the industry is at an inflection point for massive change." Cook enumerated ways that the modern descendants of the [[Ford Model T]] would be shaken to the very chassis—the growing importance of software in the car of the future, the rise of autonomous vehicles, and the shift from an [[internal combustion engine]] to electrification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://recode.net/2015/10/19/apple-ceo-tim-cook-massive-change-is-coming-to-the-auto-industry/ |title=Apple CEO Tim Cook: 'Massive Change' Is Coming to Cars |first=Dawn |last=Chmielewski |date= |work=Re/code |accessdate=October 20, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020225015/http://recode.net/2015/10/19/apple-ceo-tim-cook-massive-change-is-coming-to-the-auto-industry/ |archivedate=October 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, various websites reported that suspected Apple front SixtyEight Research had attended an auto body conference in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/11/09/shadowy-group-linked-to-apples-project-titan-spotted-at-auto-industry-conference |title = Shadowy Group Linked to Apple's 'Project Titan' Spotted at Auto Industry Conference |date = November 9, 2015 |work = [[Appleinsider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in November 2015, after unknown EV startup [[Faraday Future]] announced a $1 billion U.S. factory project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/faraday-future-electric-car-manufacturing-plant-2015-11 |title = A Mysterious Electric-Car Startup Is Building a $1 Billion Factory in California |first = Justin |last = Pritchard |work = Business Insider |date = November 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; some speculated that it might actually be a front for Apple's secret car project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/11/06/rumor-claims-new-electric-car-maker-faraday-future-is-front-for-apple |title = Rumor Claims New Electric Car Maker Faraday Future Is Front for Apple |first = Roger |last = Fingas |date = November 6, 2015 |publisher = AppleInsider }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimgorzelany/2015/11/09/is-faraday-apples-automotive-beard/ |title = Is Faraday Apple's Automotive 'Beard?' |first = Jim |last = Gorzelany |date = November 9, 2015 |work = [[Forbes]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2015, Apple contracted [[Torc Robotics]] to retrofit two [[Lexus]] SUVs with sensors in a project known internally as Baja.&lt;ref name="NYT May 2018 VW partnership"/&gt;

=== 2016 ===

In 2016, [[Tesla Motors]] CEO [[Elon Musk]] stated that Apple will probably make a compelling electric car: "It's pretty hard to hide something if you hire over a thousand engineers to do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35280633 |title = Tesla Chief Elon Musk Says Apple Is Making an Electric Car |date =  January 11, 2016|publisher = BBC News |accessdate = January 12, 2016 |last1 = Cellan-Jones |first1 = Rory }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, there were reports indicating Apple was interested in electric car [[charging station]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://in.reuters.com/article/apple-charging-idINKCN0YG25R |title = Exclusive: Apple Explores Charging Stations for Electric Vehicles |first1 = Julia |last1 = Love |first2 = Alexandria |last2 = Sage |last-author-amp = yes |date = May 26, 2016 |publisher = Reuters |access-date = May 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported on July 25, 2016 that Apple had convinced retired senior hardware engineering executive [[Bob Mansfield]] to return and take over the Titan project.&lt;ref name=W&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-taps-bob-mansfield-to-oversee-car-project-1469458580|title=Apple Taps Bob Mansfield to Oversee Car Project|author=Daisuke Wakabayashi|date=July 25, 2016|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2016/07/25/apple-car-bob-mansfield/|title=WSJ: Apple recruits retired hardware expert Bob Mansfield to lead Apple Car project|author=Zac Hall|date=July 25, 2016|website=[[9 to 5 Mac]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, on July 29, ''[[Bloomberg Technology]]'' reported that Apple had hired Dan Dodge, the founder and former chief executive officer of [[QNX]], [[BlackBerry Ltd.]]’s automotive software division.  According to ''Bloomberg'', Dodge's hiring heralded a shift in emphasis at Apple's Project Titan, in which the company will give first priority to creating software for autonomous vehicles. However, the story said that Apple would continue to develop a vehicle of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-28/apple-taps-blackberry-talent-as-car-project-takes-software-turn|title=Apple Hires BlackBerry Talent With Car Project Turning to Self-Driving Software|last=atbwebb|first=Mark Gurman markgurman Alex Webb|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date= July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 9, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported dozens of layoffs in an effort to reboot,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/10/technology/apple-is-said-to-be-rethinking-strategy-on-self-driving-cars.html?_r=0 |title = Apple Is Said to Be Rethinking Strategy on Self-Driving Cars |last = Wakabayashi |first = Daisuke |work= [[The New York Times]] |access-date = October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; presumably from a team still numbering around 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macobserver.com/analysis/bob-mansfield-reportedly-shaking-apple-car-project-layoffs/|title=Bob Mansfield Reportedly Shaking Up Apple Car Project With Layoffs|author=Bryan Chaffin|date=September 10, 2016|website=The Mac Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following week, reports surfaced that [[Magna International]], a contract vehicle manufacturer, had a small team working at Apple's Sunnyvale lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-car-magna-steyr-ceo-donald-walker-2016-9|title=This little-known company could be building Apple's car|author=Kif Leswing|date=September 15, 2016|website=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===

After a period of no new reports, car project news flared up again in mid-April, 2017, as word spread that Apple was permitted to test autonomous vehicles on California roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/14/15303338/apple-autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-california|title=Apple just received a permit to test self-driving cars in California|author=Andrew J. Hawkins|date=April 14, 2017|website=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-June, [[Tim Cook]] in an interview with ''[[Bloomberg TV]]'' said Apple was "focusing on autonomous systems" but not necessarily leading to an actual Apple car product, leaving speculation about Apple's role in the convergence of three disruptive "vectors of change": autonomous systems, electric vehicles and ride-sharing services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://9to5mac.com/2017/06/13/apple-car-tim-cook-confirmation/|title= Tim Cook says self-driving car tech 'incredibly exciting,' Apple may or may not make a car|author=Ben Lovejoy|date=June 13, 2017|website=9 to 5 Mac}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-August, various sources reported that the car project was focusing on autonomous systems, now expected to test its technology in the real world using a company-operated inter-campus shuttle service between the main Infinite Loop campus in Cupertino and various Silicon Valley offices, including the new Apple Park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/technology/apple-self-driving-car.html|title=Apple Scales Back Its Ambitions for a Self-Driving Car|author=Daisuke Wakabayashi|date=August 22, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/08/22/self-driving-campus-shuttle-to-rise-from-ashes-of-apples-project-titan-report-says|title=Self-driving campus shuttle to rise from ashes of Apple's 'Project Titan,' report says|author=Mikey Campbell|date=August 22, 2017|website=AppleInsider}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-reportedly-scales-back-car-effort-2017-8|title=Apple reportedly scaled back its car ambitions because nobody could agree on what an Apple Car should do|author=Matt Weinberger|date=August 22, 2017|website=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then at the end of August, around 17 former Titan team members, braking and suspension engineers with Detroit experience, were hired by autonomous vehicle startup Zoox,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/08/30/apple-self-driving-engineers-head-to-startup-zoox/|title=Apple self-driving engineers head to startup Zoox|author=Seung Lee|date=August 30, 2017|newspaper=[[San Jose Mercury News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/08/30/apple-auto-engineers-join-zoox/|title=Autonomous Vehicle Startup Zoox Snags 17 Former Apple Automotive Engineers|author=Juli Clover|date=August 30, 2017|website=[[MacRumors]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; described as "a robotics company pioneering autonomous mobility as-a-service".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zoox#/entity|title=Zoox {{!}} Crunchbase|website=[[CrunchBase]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oct. 2016 reports claimed the Titan project has a 2017 deadline to determine its fate - prove its practicality and viability, set a final direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/10/17/apple-car-project-to-choose-new-direction-in-late-2017---report|title='Apple Car' project to choose new direction in late 2017 - report|author=Roger Fingas|date=October 17, 2016|website=[[Apple Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/17/apple-executives-to-decide-fate-of-self-driving-car-by-late-2017-report.html|title=Apple executives to decide fate of self-driving car by late 2017: Report|author=Berkeley Lovelace Jr.|date=October 17, 2016|website=[[CNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Apple employees Yin Zhou and Oncel Tuzel published a paper on VoxelNet, which uses a [[convolutional neural network]] to detect three dimensional objects using [[lidar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title=VoxelNet: End-to-End Learning for Point Cloud Based 3D Object Detection|author1=Yin Zhou|author2=Oncel Tuzel|year=2017|class=cs.CV|eprint=1711.06396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transportation/tech website ''[[Jalopnik]]'' reported in late November that Apple was recruiting automotive test engineering and tech talent for autonomous systems work, and appeared to be surreptitiously leasing, via third parties, a former Fiat Chrysler proving grounds site in Surprise, Arizona (originally Wittman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Felton|first1=Ryan|title=Apple Might Be Leasing Chrysler's Old Proving Grounds To Test Autonomous Car Technology|url=https://jalopnik.com/apple-might-be-leasing-chryslers-old-proving-grounds-to-1820782763|website=Jalopnik|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 2017, the ''New York Times'' suggested that Apple had stopped developing its own self-driving car.&lt;ref name=J/&gt; In response to such reports, Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged publicly that year that the company was working on autonomous-car technology.&lt;ref name=D/&gt;

===2018===
In January 2018, the company registered 27 self-driving vehicles with California's Department of Motor Vehicles.&lt;ref name=D/&gt;

In May 2018, a ''[[New York Times]]'' article reported on major project news.&lt;ref name="NYT May 2018 VW partnership"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicas|first1=Jack|title=Apple, Spurned by Others, Signs Deal With Volkswagen for Driverless Cars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/technology/apple-bmw-mercedes-volkswagen-driverless-cars.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=24 May 2018|date=23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After proposed partnership arrangements with Germany's high-end brands [[BMW]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] failed,&lt;ref name="NYT May 2018 VW partnership"/&gt; as did potential alliances with [[Nissan]], [[BYD Auto]], [[McLaren Automotive]], and others, Apple reportedly partnered with [[Volkswagen]] to produce an autonomous employee shuttle van based on the [[Volkswagen Transporter (T6)|T6 Transporter]] commercial vehicle platform.&lt;ref name="NYT May 2018 VW partnership"/&gt; The T6 Transports would be transformed into autonomous electric versions at VW's [[Italdesign]] subsidiary in [[Turin, Italy]], with the frame, wheels, and chassis remaining the same.&lt;ref name="NYT May 2018 VW partnership"/&gt;

While Apple does its best to keep its autonomous vehicles plans secret,&lt;ref name=A/&gt;&lt;ref name=B/&gt; regulatory filings do provide some factual insight into its activities. In September 2018, Apple was reportedly in third place in the number of California autonomous vehicle permits with 70, behind [[General Motors|GM]]'s [[Cruise Automation|Cruise]] (175) and [[Alphabet (company)|Alphabet]]'s [[Waymo]] (88).&lt;ref name=B&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/11/apple-autonomous-vehicle-test-fleet-california-70/|title=Apple's autonomous vehicle fleet swells 27% in four months|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
