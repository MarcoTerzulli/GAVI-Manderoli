{{Mac OS X topics}}
'''Apple's Intel Transition''' was the process of changing the [[central processing unit|Central Processing Unit]] (CPU) of [[Macintosh]] [[computers]] from [[PowerPC]] processors to [[Intel]] [[x86]] processors. The transition became public knowledge at the 2005 [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC), when [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] CEO [[Steve Jobs]] made the announcement that the company would make a transition from the use of PowerPC [[microprocessor]]s supplied by [[Freescale]] (formerly [[Motorola]]) and [[IBM]] in its Macintosh computers, to processors designed and manufactured by Intel, a chief supplier for most of Apple's competitors.&lt;ref name="apple-pr-2005"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2005/06/06Apple-to-Use-Intel-Microprocessors-Beginning-in-2006/ |title=Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006 |date=June 6, 2005 |publisher=[[Apple Computer|Apple]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition marked the Macintosh platform's second migration to a new CPU architecture. The first was the switch from the [[Motorola 68000 series|Motorola 68000 ("68k") series architecture]] (used since the original [[Macintosh 128K]]) to the [[PowerPC]] architecture.

Apple's initial press release indicated the transition would begin by June 2006, and finish by the end of 2007, but it actually proceeded much more quickly. The first generation Intel-based Macintoshes were released in January 2006 with [[Mac OS X Tiger|Mac OS X 10.4.4 Tiger]], and Steve Jobs announced the last models to switch in August 2006, with the [[Mac Pro]] available immediately and with the Intel [[Xserve]] available by October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1052233/liveupdate.html|website=[[Macworld]]|title=WWDC Live Keynote Update|first=Peter|last=Cohen|date=August 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xserve servers were available in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://images.apple.com/xserve/pdf/Xserve_TechnologyOverview12202006.pdf |title=Xserve Technology Overview|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple released [[Mac OS X v10.6]] "Snow Leopard" on August 28, 2009 as Intel-only, removing support for the PowerPC architecture. It is also the last Mac OS X version that supports PowerPC based applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/06/09Apple-Previews-Mac-OS-X-Snow-Leopard-to-Developers/ | title=Apple Previews Mac OS X Snow Leopard to Developers | publisher=[[Apple Inc.]] | date=June 9, 2008 | accessdate=2017-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Mac OS X v10.7]] "Lion" dropped support for [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]].

* August 7, 2013: PowerPC hardware reaches "obsolete" status having been discontinued seven years prior, ending all of Apple's service and parts support for PowerPC hardware.

==Product renaming==
The names of some of Apple's desktop and laptop product lines changed between the PowerPC version and the corresponding Intel version. Most notably, the word "Power" was dropped from all product lines.  During the Keynote address at Macworld in 2006, where the first Intel-based Macs, the iMac and MacBook Pro, were announced, Steve Jobs remarked that the new naming schemes for their products reflected their desire to have "Mac" in the name of all of their computers, and because they were "done with power." This was in reference to the fact that the previous PowerPC G5 processors were not energy efficient, and therefore used far too much power to be used in any portable Macs.

==Precedents==
The first known attempt to move to Intel platforms was the [[Star Trek project]] from spring 1992 to 1993, a joint effort with [[Novell]] to port Mac OS 7 to run on ordinary 486 PCs. It was based on Novell's next in-development version of DR&amp;nbsp;DOS with its pre-emptive multitasker, which provided a hybrid 32-bit/16-bit core system similar in architecture to Windows 3.1 in 386 Enhanced Mode, but without a GUI. The ported System 7.1 ran on top of this environment. While the project was successful with running pre-beta versions it was stopped in 1993 after management and strategy changes. The core system (but without the Star Trek-specific components) was later released as part of Novell DOS 7.

The Macintosh line underwent a similar transition between 1994 and about 1996, when Apple switched from Motorola's [[68k]] series of chips to [[IBM]]/Motorola [[PowerPC]] processors, developed jointly by Motorola,  Apple, and IBM. This took several years, during which Apple produced versions of the [[classic Mac OS]] that could run on either platform, introduced fairly low-level emulation of the 68k architecture by the PowerPC models, and encouraged third-party developers to release [[fat binary|fat binaries]] that could run natively on either architecture.

Apple later transitioned the Macintosh from the earlier [[classic Mac OS]] to [[Mac OS X]]. This transition also took a number of years, and was facilitated by the inclusion of [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]], an environment in which an instance of [[Mac OS 9]] could be run, permitting the execution of programs that had not been ported to Mac OS X, as well as the introduction of [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] for Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X, allowing programs to run natively on either system.

Jobs revealed at the 2005 WWDC that every version of Mac OS X had been secretly developed and compiled for Intel processors (as well as PowerPC) as they were developed; the [[cross-platform|portability]] of its predecessor [[NeXTSTEP]] had been maintained. It is not publicly known whether Apple maintains current builds for any other architectures although the related [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] runs on the [[iPhone]]'s [[ARM architecture]].

==Reasons==
[[File:Steve Jobs Presentation 2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Steve Jobs reveals Mac OS X running on [[Pentium 4]] hardware.]]
Steve Jobs stated that Apple's primary motivation for the transition was their disappointment with the progress of IBM's development of PowerPC technology, and their greater faith in Intel to meet Apple's needs. In particular, he cited the [[performance per watt]] projections in the [[Technology roadmapping|roadmap]] provided by Intel.&lt;ref name="macworld.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1046961/intelvsamd.html|title=Analysis: Why Apple picked Intel over AMD|date=September 15, 2005|website=Macworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an especially important consideration in laptop design, which affects the hours of use per battery charge.

In June 2003, Jobs had introduced Macs based on the [[PowerPC 970|PowerPC G5]] processor and promised that within a year, the [[clock speed]] of the part would be up to 3 [[Gigahertz|GHz]]. Two years later, 3&amp;nbsp;GHz G5s were still not available, and rumors continued that IBM's low yields on the [[POWER4]]-derived chip were to blame. Further, the heat produced by the chip proved an obstacle to deploying it in a [[laptop]] computer, which had become the fastest growing segment of the [[personal computer]] industry.

Some observers were surprised that Apple had not made a deal with [[AMD]], which had in recent years become a strong competitor to Intel. AMD had recently released its competitive 64-bit [[Opteron]] platform,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/2664991/amd-s-profits-grow-on-opteron--flash-memory.html|title=AMD's profits grow on Opteron, flash memory|first=Tom|last=Krazit|date=April 15, 2004|website=InfoWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.debian.org/ports/amd64/index.en.html|title=Debian -- AMD64 Port|website=www.debian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by moving straight to [[x86-64]] Apple would have had one less architecture transition. Analysts have speculated that AMD's lack of low-power designs at the time were behind the decision to go with Intel.&lt;ref name="macworld.com"/&gt; However, in 2011, Apple investigated using AMD’s low power [[AMD Fusion#Llano .2832.C2.A0nm.29 2|Llano APU]] for the [[MacBook Air]], but eventually opted for Intel due to AMD's potential inability to supply enough Llano processors to meet demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://semiaccurate.com/2011/11/17/apple-macbook-air-with-amd-processor-dead/ |title=Exclusive: Apple MacBook Air with AMD processor dead |date=2011-11-17 |publisher=[[SemiAccurate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}
Advocates of the transition pointed out the potential for the new Intel Mac systems to run four classes of software at native speeds: Mac OS X binaries, [[Java (programming language)|Java]]/[[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] applications, [[Unix]] applications, and [[Win32]]/x86 applications.

Originally, [[emulator|emulation]] software such as [[DOSBox]] or [[Microsoft Virtual PC]] was required to run x86 software on the Macintosh. Such software could now enjoy much more success with near-native performance through [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]], such as is currently being done by [[Parallels Desktop for Mac]] and [[VMware Fusion]]. For those customers wishing to achieve a more conventional environment, a [[Multi boot|dual boot]] solution is possible on an x86 Apple device using [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] software (which includes Windows drivers for Mac hardware). Some third-party partitioning options can even provide triple, or even quadruple boot.

Although most games depend on the use of [[DirectX]] [[Application programming interface|API]]s not available on Mac OS X (on either processor type), it should be easier to port OS-independent code, such as [[OpenGL]], now that developers no longer have to resolve [[endianness|endian]], and other [[Instruction set|ISA]] dependency issues associated with moving from x86 to PowerPC.

==Drawbacks==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}
===Reaction to the change===

The announcement of Apple's intention to switch to Intel-based Macs caused concern because [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]], the PowerPC dynamic translator, when first announced, emulated a [[PowerPC G3|G3]] at only 60–80% of a similarly powered CPU's clock speed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Apart from this, [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]], the [[Mac OS 9]] virtualization for Mac OS X, was not ported to the x86 architecture, leaving the new Intel-powered Macs incompatible with original Mac OS applications without a proper third-party PowerPC emulator.

The performance of Intel's [[chipset]]s was a concern{{By whom|date=February 2020}}, along with the x86 architecture itself, and whether it would affect system performance and application quality. Other problems include [[endianness]] and reduced floating point performance in real world applications relative to equivalent or contemporary PowerPC processors.

It was also feared{{By whom|date=February 2020}} that it may be possible for Windows and Windows applications to run natively on Mac hardware, possibly killing off Mac OS X and/or applications developed for it. There was concern that the early announcement of the change would cause an [[Osborne effect]], and there was the possibility that Intel could force Apple to use the [[Intel Inside]] branding. In addition, Apple had nurtured a feeling of animosity toward Intel among its loyal base. It would take time and money to convince Apple's most loyal customers that Intel was acceptable.

There were also fears that Intel, which took part in the development and implementation of the [[USB]], would force Apple to drop all development and support of its [[FireWire]] serial bus on all Intel Macs. This did not occur, as FireWire ports continued to be included on all Macs, except certain notebook configurations beginning with the [[MacBook Air]] in 2008, until being replaced by the faster [[Thunderbolt (interface)|Thunderbolt]] port.

Many of these fears were put to rest at Macworld 2006 with the arrival of the first Intel-based Macs. [[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]] was improved to offer much faster speeds than originally demonstrated (though benchmarks suggest that PowerPC code still does not perform as well under emulation on a Core Duo iMac as it does on a G5 iMac&lt;ref&gt;Anandtech, January 30, 2006: [http://www.anandtech.com/mac/showdoc.aspx?i=2685 Apple Makes the Switch: iMac G5 vs. iMac Core Duo]&lt;/ref&gt;). Intel's Core Duo CPUs perform nearly as well as the most powerful [[Power Mac G5]] towers.

Applications native to both PPC and Intel-based Macs such as Safari web browser were found to perform better on the Intel-based Mac than on the PPC-based Mac. However, [[classic Mac OS]] applications will not run directly on Intel Macs. Pre-Mac OS X applications can only be run on Intel Macs by using [[emulator]]s such as [[vMac]], [[Basilisk II]], and [[SheepShaver]], though the lack of stability of these emulators severely limits their functionality.

Fears of an [[Osborne effect]] were dismissed after sales of Macs for the Christmas 2005 quarter saw an increase over the previous Christmas. Unlike Windows-based PC counterparts "Intel Inside" stickers have never been included on any Apple product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2007/08/apple-fan-frenz/ | work=Wired | first=Charlie | last=Sorrel | title=Apple Fan Frenzy: Stickergate | date=August 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardware-oriented===
There were questions over the extent to which Apple would retain control over the non-processor components of the system design. Apple is traditionally a systems builder, and some feared that Apple's [[industrial design]] philosophy may be affected if the company switched to commodity parts. Others noted that Apple has slowly been switching to standard parts since the introduction of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] Power Mac in 1995, and said that using a non-Apple chipset in itself would not harm the Mac's image.

Intel Macs employ a different Intel technology for [[firmware]], [[Extensible Firmware Interface]], not the [[Open Firmware]] Apple had been using. EFI removes the traditional PC reliance on the [[BIOS]] while providing more functionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/universal_binary/universal_binary_diffs/chapter_3_section_10.html|title=Apple's transition documentation: Extensible Firmware Interface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the x86 architecture allows Windows to run natively on Apple hardware, and opens the possibility of using the [[Wine package]] to run Windows executables directly. Some{{Who|date=September 2010}} fear that the change will make Mac OS X a less valuable target for software developers, since [[Mac OS X]] users can use a [[dual boot|dual-boot]] setup or a Wine variant (such as [[CrossOver Mac]] or [[Darwine]]) to run Windows apps instead. Others say that it could be a boon to [[Apple Switch ad campaign|switchers]], since they would not have to leave their Windows applications behind while trying out Mac OS X. The idea of [[Mac OS X]] being available on regular PCs has also been discussed, but Apple has said that they will not allow regular PCs to run Mac OS X.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/05/06/08/apple_vp_says_mac_os_x_wont_run_on_other_pcs|title=Apple VP says Mac OS X won\'t run on other PCs|website=AppleInsider}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[OSx86]] Project, however, is able to install Mac OS X on non-Apple PCs. It was previously thought that since Windows XP is incompatible with the [[Extensible Firmware Interface]], it would not be run on Intel-based Macs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=[[Engadget]]|date=January 11, 2006|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/01/11/no-xp-on-intel-macs-but-vista-is-good-to-go/|title=New Macs not XP friendly, but Vista is good to go|first=Marc|last=Perton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the Boot Camp announcement, a prize contest&lt;ref name=onmac&gt;{{cite web|website=Onmac.net|date=March 16, 2006|url=http://onmac.net/|title=Windows XP on an Intel Mac}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a working solution for dual-booting Windows XP and Mac OS X on an Intel Mac. Microsoft has announced that [[Windows Vista]] will not be EFI-compatible on 32-bit platforms, but the later versions of Boot Camp allow Vista to be installed on any Intel Mac.

Intel was seen among the Mac community as a purveyor of hot-running chips (especially the [[Pentium 4]]). Apple themselves mocked the Pentium range in their "Toasted [[Cleanroom suit|Bunnies]]" advertisements of the late 1990s. However, the [[Pentium M]] chips, which were designed for laptop use, run much cooler than the Pentium 4. Apple claimed the then-new Intel Core chips, which are based on the Pentium M microarchitecture, would have dramatically better performance per watt than the PowerPC G4 and G5.

Finally, the relative quality of the x86 architecture has been discussed. Critics of the switch say that x86 was a poor choice because of its lack of [[hardware register]]s compared to the PowerPC, and the lack of [[AltiVec]] (also known as [[Velocity Engine]]). Proponents have responded by saying that the x86 architecture has evolved greatly since the original 8086 was introduced, and that CPUs in general have combined [[RISC]] and [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] philosophies in their internal designs for some time, making the distinction obsolete. They also point out that improved [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] could equal [[AltiVec]], and that most programmers rarely deal with x86's peculiarities because the [[compiler]] does the work.

The PowerPC G5 was a 64-bit design, although very few applications made use of the increased address space. In contrast the original Core Solo and Core Duo chips were [[32-bit]]. On August 7, 2006, Apple released the [[Mac Pro]] and Intel-based [[Xserve]], introducing Intel 64 (Intel's implementation of [[x86-64]]) architecture into the lineup through the use of the [[Xeon]] processor. By August 7, 2007, all other computers in Apple's product line had been updated with the 64-bit Core 2 Duo; all subsequent Macs have had 64-bit processors.

While the current benchmarks comparing Core Duo to Core 2 Duo processors show very little difference when running in 32 bit, the 64 bit edge has become more of an issue with the release of [[Mac OS X v10.6]] (Snow Leopard), and now users can dual boot Windows 7 in full 64-bit mode.{{Update inline|date=February 2020}}

===Existing PowerPC applications===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Universal Binary Logo.png|thumb|right|125px|The Universal badge indicates software that will run at full speed on both PPC and Intel Macs.]]  --&gt;Java applications (that do not rely on [[Java Native Interface]]), some [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard]] [[Widget (computing)|Widgets]], and [[Scripting programming language|scripts]] that execute inside an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] all work immediately on both processors and are immune to changes.

In [[Mac OS X v10.4|Mac OS X 10.4]] to [[Mac OS X v10.6|Mac OS X 10.6]], PowerPC applications that cannot be migrated ran inside a PowerPC [[Binary translation|dynamic translator]] on Intel called "[[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]]." Rosetta is an instruction translator comparable to the 68k emulator that allows PowerPC Macintoshes to run pre-PowerPC code, rather than a virtual system like [[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]]; it does not require a second operating system to be loaded as a subsystem before the application can work. It was originally limited to a [[PowerPC G3|G3]] instruction set, but later supported [[AltiVec]] and the [[PowerPC G4|G4]] instruction set, leaving only the [[PowerPC G5|G5]] additions unsupported. Rosetta was discontinued in [[Mac OS X v10.7|Mac OS X 10.7]] and is no longer available.

AltiVec itself has been encapsulated since [[Mac OS X v10.3|Mac OS 10.3]] by a vectorization library; this library uses AltiVec on the PowerPC and [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]] (or equivalent regular instructions) on x86.

A new version of [[Xcode]] was released that supported the generation of [[Universal Binaries]] for Intel and PowerPC, the new system's equivalent of the earlier 68k-PowerPC [[fat binary|fat binaries]]. [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] applications can be ported simply by recompiling them and checking for endianness problems. [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] applications required some additional tuning, but not of the complexity of the transition from Mac OS 9. Applications written using [[Metrowerks]] [[CodeWarrior]] suite had to be modified; those that use [[PowerPlant]] required further code changes, described by Apple and Metrowerks.

[[Classic (Mac OS X)|Classic]] is not supported on the x86 architecture. This means that pre-Mac OS X software does not run on Mac OS X out of the box, to which some users running older applications (such as [[QuarkXPress]] 4 and 5) objected.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} However, third-party emulators, such as [[Mini vMac]], [[Basilisk II]], and [[SheepShaver]], have been ported to Intel-based Macs, allowing some pre-Mac OS X software to run.
