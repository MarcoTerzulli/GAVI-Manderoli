[[File: Sunrise at Creation.jpg|thumb|right|The sun rises over the circular mound of creation as goddesses pour out the primeval waters around it]]
'''Ancient Egyptian creation myths''' are the [[ancient Egypt]]ian accounts of the [[Creation myth|creation of the world]]. The [[Pyramid Texts]], tomb wall decorations and writings, dating back to the Old Kingdom (2780–2250 BC) have given us most of our information regarding early Egyptian creation myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In all of these myths, the world was said to have emerged from an infinite, lifeless sea when the sun rose for the first time, in a distant period known as ''zp tpj'' (sometimes transcribed as Zep Tepi), "the first occasion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

While these differing [[Cosmogony|cosmogonies]] competed to some extent, in other ways they were complementary, as different aspects of the Egyptian understanding of creation.  

==Common elements==
The different creation myths have some elements in common. They all held that the world had arisen out of the lifeless waters of chaos, called [[Nu (mythology)|Nu]]. They also included a pyramid-shaped mound, called the ''[[benben]]'', which was the first thing to emerge from the waters. These elements were likely inspired by the flooding of the [[Nile|Nile River]] each year; the receding floodwaters left fertile soil in their wake, and the Egyptians may have equated this with the emergence of life from the primeval chaos. The imagery of the pyramidal mound derived from the highest mounds of earth emerging as the river receded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sun was also closely associated with creation, and it was said to have first risen from the mound, as the general sun-god [[Ra]] or as the god [[Khepri]], who represented the newly-risen sun.&lt;ref name="Allen 144"&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many versions of the sun's emergence, and it was said to have emerged directly from the mound or from a lotus flower that grew from the mound, in the form of a heron, falcon, scarab beetle, or human child.&lt;ref name="Allen 144"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common element of Egyptian cosmogonies is the familiar figure of the [[cosmic egg]], a substitute for the primeval waters or the primeval mound. One variant of the [[cosmic egg]] version teaches that the sun god, as primeval power, emerged from the primeval mound, which itself stood in the chaos of the primeval sea.&lt;ref&gt;Leeming, ''Creation Myths of the World'', p.104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cosmogonies==
The different creation accounts were each associated with the cult of a particular god in one of the major cities of Egypt: [[Hermopolis]], [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], and [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].&lt;ref&gt;Fleming and Lothian, ''Way to Eternity'', pp. 24-28.&lt;/ref&gt; To some degree, these myths represent competing theologies, but they also represent different aspects of the process of creation.&lt;ref name="Allen, p. 126"&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hermopolis===
The creation myth promulgated in the city of Hermopolis focused on the nature of the universe before the creation of the world. The inherent qualities of the primeval waters were represented by a set of eight gods, called the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]]. The god Nu and his female counterpart Naunet represented the inert primeval water itself; [[Huh (god)|Huh]] and his counterpart [[Hauhet]] represented the water's infinite extent; [[Kek (mythology)|Kek]] and [[Kauket]] personified the darkness present within it; and Amun and [[Amaunet]] represented its hidden and unknowable nature, in contrast to the tangible world of the living. The primeval waters were themselves part of the creation process, therefore, the deities representing them could be seen as creator gods.&lt;ref name=" Allen, p. 126" /&gt; According to the myth, the eight gods were originally divided into male and female groups.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming and Lothian, ''Way to Eternity'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; They were symbolically depicted as aquatic creatures because they dwelt within the water: the males were represented as frogs, and the females were represented as [[Snake Goddess|snakes]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, ''Complete Gods and Goddesses'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; These two groups eventually converged, resulting in a great upheaval, which produced the pyramidal mound. From it emerged the sun, which rose into the sky to light the world.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming and Lothian, ''Way to Eternity'', pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heliopolis===
In [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], the creation was attributed to [[Atum]], a deity closely associated with Ra, who was said to have existed in the waters of Nu as an inert potential being. Atum was a self-engendered god, the source of all the elements and forces in the world, and the Heliopolitan myth described the process by which he "evolved" from a single being into this multiplicity of elements.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', p. 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, ''Complete Gods and Goddesses'', pp. 99-100.&lt;/ref&gt; The process began when Atum appeared on the mound and gave rise to the air god [[Shu (Egyptian deity)|Shu]] and his sister [[Tefnut]],&lt;ref&gt;Fleming and Lothian, ''Way to Eternity'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; whose existence represented the emergence of an empty space amid the waters.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; To explain how Atum did this, the myth uses the metaphor of [[masturbation]], with the hand he used in this act representing the female principle inherent within him.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, ''Complete Gods and Goddesses'', pp. 18, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also said to have "sneezed" and "spat" to produce Shu and Tefnut, a metaphor that arose from puns on their names.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; Next, Shu and Tefnut coupled to produce the earth god [[Geb]] and the sky goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], who defined the limits of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Geb and Nut in turn gave rise to four children, who represented the forces of life: [[Osiris]], god of fertility and regeneration; [[Isis]], goddess of motherhood; [[Set (mythology)|Set]], the god of chaos; and [[Nephthys]], the female complement of Set. The myth thus represented the process by which life was made possible. These nine gods were grouped together theologically as the [[Ennead]], but the eight lesser gods, and all other things in the world, were ultimately seen as extensions of Atum.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', pp. 144-145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, ''Complete Gods and Goddesses'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memphis===
The Memphite version of creation centred on [[Ptah]], who was the patron god of craftsmen. As such, he represented the craftsman's ability to envision a finished product, and shape raw materials to create that product. The Memphite theology said that Ptah created the world in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', pp.172-173.&lt;/ref&gt; This, unlike the other Egyptian creations, was not a physical but an intellectual creation by the Word and the Mind of God.&lt;ref&gt;Seton-Williams, ''Egyptian Legends and Stories'', p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The ideas developed within Ptah's heart (regarded by the Egyptians as the seat of human thought) were given form when he named them with his tongue. By speaking these names, Ptah produced the gods and all other things.&lt;ref name="Lothian, p. 25"&gt;Fleming and Lothian, ''Way to Eternity'', p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Memphite creation myth coexisted with that of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], as Ptah's creative thought and speech were believed to have caused the formation of Atum and the Ennead.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Ptah was also associated with [[Tatjenen]], the god who personified the pyramidal mound.&lt;ref name="Lothian, p. 25" /&gt;

===Thebes===
Theban theology claimed that [[Amun]] was not merely a member of the [[Ogdoad (Egyptian)|Ogdoad]], but the hidden force behind all things. There is a conflation of all notions of creation into the personality of [[Amun]], a synthesis which emphasizes how Amun transcends all other deities in his being "beyond the sky and deeper than the underworld".&lt;ref&gt;Hart, ''Egyptian Myths'', p.22&lt;/ref&gt; One Theban myth likened Amun's act of creation to the call of a goose, which broke the stillness of the primeval waters and caused the Ogdoad and Ennead to form.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming and Lothian, ''Way to Eternity'', pp. 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Amun was separate from the world, his true nature was concealed even from the other gods. At the same time, however, because he was the ultimate source of creation, all the gods, including the other creators, were in fact merely aspects of Amun. Amun eventually became the supreme god of the [[Egyptian pantheon]] because of this belief.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, ''Middle Egyptian'', pp.182-183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amun is synonymous with the growth of Thebes as a major religious capital. But it is the columned halls, obelisks, colossal statues, wall-reliefs and hieroglyphic inscriptions of the Theban temples that we look to gain the true impression of Amun's superiority. Thebes was thought of as the location of the emergence of the primeval mound at the beginning of time.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, ''Egyptian Myths'', pp.22-24&lt;/ref&gt;
