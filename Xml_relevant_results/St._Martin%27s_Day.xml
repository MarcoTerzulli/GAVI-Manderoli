'''Saint Martin's day''', also known as the '''Funeral of Saint Martin''', '''Martinstag''' or '''Martinmas''', as well as '''Old Halloween'''  and '''Old Hallowmas Eve''',&lt;ref name="Bulik2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bulik|first=Mark|title=The Sons of Molly Maguire: The Irish Roots of America's First Labor War|date=1 January 2015|publisher=Fordham University Press|language=English |isbn=9780823262243|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carlyle2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlyle|first=Thomas|title=The Works of Thomas Carlyle|date=11 November 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English |isbn=9781108022354|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the Funeral  day of [[Saint Martin of Tours]] (Martin le Miséricordieux) and is celebrated on [[11 November ]] each year. This is the time when autumn wheat seeding was completed, and the annual slaughter of fattened cattle produced "Martinmas beef".&lt;ref&gt;George C. Homans, ''English Villagers of the Thirteenth Century'', 2nd ed. 1991, "The Husbandman's year" p355f.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically, hiring fairs were held where farm laborers would seek new posts.

Saint Martin of Tours was a [[Roman soldier]] who was baptised as an adult and became a bishop in a French town. The most famous legend concerning him was that he had once cut his cloak in half to share with a beggar during a snowstorm, to save the latter from the cold. That night, he dreamt of [[Jesus]], wearing the half-cloak and saying to the angels, "Here is Martin, the Roman soldier who is now baptised; he has clothed me."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.users.csbsju.edu/~eknuth/npnf2-11/sulpitiu/lifeofst.html#tp Sulpicius, ch 2 CSBSJU.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Martin died on November 8, 397, and was buried on November 11, 397.

== Customs ==
St. Martin was known as friend of the children and patron of the poor.&lt;ref name=kaiserlautern/&gt; This holiday originated in France, then spread to the Low Countries, the British Isles, Germany, Scandinavia, and Eastern Europe.  It celebrates the end of the agrarian year and the end of the harvest.&lt;ref&gt;[httpsto supported sites ://www.germansociety.org/event_stmartin.html "Saint Martin's Day Parade", German Society of Pennsylvania]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century, church councils began requiring fasting on all days except Saturdays and Sundays from Saint Martin's Day to [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] (the Feast of the Three Wise Men and the star, c.f. Matthew 2: 1–12) on January 6, a period of 56 days. This was similar to the 40 days fasting of [[Lent]], so this 56-day period was called ''Quadragesima Sancti Martini'' (Saint Martin's Lent).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hfVdAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP42&amp;dq=Ambrosian+Advent&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gWOaVP3QKqqy7Qbg_4GgDg&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ambrosian%20Advent&amp;f=false Philip H. Pfatteicher, ''Journey into the Heart of God'' (Oxford University Press 2013] {{ISBN|978-0-19999714-5}})&lt;/ref&gt; This period of fasting was later shortened and called "[[Advent]]" by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/517764/Saint-Martins-Lent |title = Saint Martin's Lent |last = |first = |publisher = Britannica |date = |website = Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate= 4 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goose became a symbol of St. Martin of Tours because of a legend that when trying to avoid being ordained bishop he had hidden in a goose pen, where he was betrayed by the cackling of the geese. St. Martin's feast day falls in November, when geese are ready for killing. St. Martin's Day was an important medieval autumn feast, and the custom of eating goose spread to Sweden from France. It was primarily observed by the craftsmen and noblemen of the towns. In the peasant community, not everyone could afford to eat goose, so many ate duck or hen instead.&lt;ref name=lilja&gt;[http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Lifestyle/Traditions/Celebrating-the-Swedish-way/St-Martins-Day---or-Martin-Goose/ Lilja, Agneta. "St Martin's Day – or 'Martin Goose'", Sweden.SE]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though no mention of Saint Martin's connection with [[viticulture]] is made by [[Gregory of Tours]] or other early hagiographers, he is nonetheless credited with a prominent role in spreading wine-making throughout the [[Touraine]] region and facilitating the planting of many vines. The Greek myth that [[Aristaeus]] first discovered the concept of [[pruning]] the vines after watching a goat eat some of the foliage has been appropriated to Martin.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, in Hugh Johnson, ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'' 1989, p 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin is also credited with introducing the [[Chenin blanc]] grape varietal, from which most of the white wine of western Touraine and Anjou is made.

As with the word “Christmas”, the term Martinmas literally means "Mass of Martin", or the day when he is honoured in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Martinmas, as a date on the calendar, has two meanings: in the agricultural calendar it marks the beginning of the natural winter, but in the economic calendar it is seen as the end of autumn. The feast coincides not only with the end of the [[Octave]] of All Saints, but with harvest-time, the time when newly produced wine is ready for drinking, and the end of winter preparations, including the butchering of animals. (An old English saying is "His Martinmas will come as it does to every hog," meaning "he will get his comeuppance" or "everyone must die".)  Because of this, St. Martin's Feast is much like the American [[Thanksgiving]] – a celebration of the earth's bounty. Because it also comes before the penitential season of Advent, it is seen as a mini "carnivale", with all the feasting and bonfires. As at [[Michaelmas]] on 29 September, goose is eaten in most places.  Following these holidays, women traditionally moved their work indoors for the winter, while men would proceed to work in the forests.
 
In some countries, Martinmas celebrations begin at the eleventh minute of the eleventh hour of this eleventh day of the eleventh month (that is, at 11:11 am on November 11). In others, the festivities commence on St. Martin's Eve (that is, on November 10). Bonfires are built and children carry lanterns in the streets after dark, singing songs for which they are rewarded with candy.

==Celebrations around the world==
===Austria===
"Martinloben" is celebrated as a collective festival. Events include art exhibitions, wine tastings, and live music. “Martinigansl” (roasted goose) is the traditional dish of the season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austria.info/us/vacation-in-austria/autumn-feast-of-st-martin-1559269.html "Autumn Feast of St. Martin", Austrian Tourism Board]&lt;/ref&gt; In Austria St. Martin's Day is celebrated the same way as in Germany. The nights before and on the night of Nov. 11, children walk in processions carrying lanterns, which they made in school, and sing Martin songs.

=== Belgium ===
The day is celebrated on the evening of November 10 in a small part of Belgium (mainly in the east of Flanders and around Ypres). Children go through the streets with [[paper lantern]]s and candles, and sing songs about St. Martin. Sometimes, a man dressed as St. Martin rides on a horse in front of the procession.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4-uWGLvCIgwC&amp;pg=PT69&amp;lpg=PT69&amp;dq=St.+Martin's+Day+in+Belgium&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WK5I0K-aiw&amp;sig=wgzG7YX5ynnJtdYqxeWIdk6HaPE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigobzRwp3QAhUQcCYKHYPqA0o4ChDoAQgrMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=St.%20Martin's%20Day%20in%20Belgium&amp;f=false Thomson, George William. ''Peeps At Many Lands: Belgium'', Library of Alexandria, 1909]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, there is a traditional goose meal, although in West Flanders there is no specific meal; in other areas it is more a day for children, with toys brought on the night of 10 to 11 November. In the west part of the Belgian province of [[West Flanders]], especially around [[Ypres]], children receive presents from either their friends or family as supposedly coming from St. Martin on November 11. In other areas it is customary that children receive gifts later in the year from either their friends or family as supposedly coming from [[Saint Nicholas]] on December 5 or 6 (called [[Sinterklaas]] in Belgium and the Netherlands) or [[Santa Claus]] on December 25.

In [[Wervik]], children go from door to door, singing traditional "Séngmarténg" songs, sporting a hollow beetroot with a carved face and a candle inside called "Bolle Séngmarténg". Later in the evening there is a bonfire where all of them gather. At the end the beetroots are thrown into the fire, and pancakes are being served.

In the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German speaking parts of Belgium]], notably [[Eupen]] and [[St. Vith|Sankt Vith]], processions similar to those in Germany take place.

===Croatia, Slovenia===
In [[Croatia]], St. Martin's Day (''Martinje'', ''Martinovanje'') marks the day when the [[must]] traditionally turns to [[wine]]. The must is usually considered impure and sinful, until it is baptised and turned into wine. The baptism is performed by someone who dresses up as a [[bishop]] and blesses the wine; this is usually done by the host. Another person is chosen as the godfather of the wine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thedubrovniktimes.com/information/item/1426-saint-martin-s-day-in-croatia Thomas, Mark. "Saint Martin’s Day in Croatia", ''The Dubrovnik Times'', November 13,2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The foods traditionally eaten on the day are [[goose]] and home-made or store bought [[mlinci]].

The biggest event in Slovenia is the St. Martin's Day celebration in Maribor which marks the symbolic winding up of all the wine growers’ endeavours. There is the ceremonial "christening" of the new wine, and the arrival of the Wine Queen. The square Trg Leona Štuklja is filled with musicians and stalls offering autumn produce and delicacies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slovenia.info/en/Ethnological-events/St-Martin%E2%80%99s-Day-Celebrations-in-Maribor.htm?etnografske_prireditve=54859&amp;lng=2 "St. Martin’s Day Celebrations in Maribor", Slovenian Tourist Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Slovakia ===
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}
In [[Slovakia]], the Feast of St. Martin is like a "2nd Birthday" for those named after this saint.  Small presents or money are common gifts for this special occasion.  Tradition says that if it snows on the feast of St. Martin, November 11, then St. Martin came on a white horse and there will be snow on [[Christmas]] day.  However, if it doesn't snow on this day, then St. Martin came on a dark horse and it will not snow at Christmas.

=== Czech Republic ===
A [[Czechs|Czech]] proverb connected with the Feast of St. Martin – ''Martin přijíždí na bílém koni'' (trans. "Martin is coming on a white horse") – signifies that the first half of November in the [[Czech Republic]] is the time when it often starts to snow. St. Martin's Day is the traditional feast day in the run-up to Advent. Roasted goose is usually found on restaurant menus, and the Czech version of Beaujolais nouveau, Svatomartinské víno, a young wine from the recent harvest, which has recently become more widely available and popular. Wine shops and restaurants around Prague pour the first of the St. Martin's wines at 11:11&amp;nbsp;a.m. Many restaurants offer special menus for the day, featuring the traditional roast goose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguepost.com/blogs/food/2011/11/11/111111-st-martin%e2%80%99s-day-specials-at-prague-restaurants/ "St. Martin’s Day specials at Prague restaurants", ''Prague Post'', 11 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In Denmark, ''Mortensaften'', meaning the evening of St. Martin, is celebrated with traditional dinners, while the day itself is rarely recognized. (''Morten'' is the Danish vernacular form of ''Martin''.) The background is the same legend as mentioned above, but nowadays the goose is most often replaced with a duck due to size, taste and/or cost.

===Estonia===
In Estonia, Martinmas signifies the merging of Western European customs with local Finnic [[Paganism|pagan]] traditions. It also contains elements of earlier worship of the dead as well as a certain year-end celebration that predates Christianity. For centuries '''mardipäev''' (Martinmas) has been one of the most important and cherished days in the [[Estonia]]n folk calendar. It remains popular today, especially among young people and the rural population. Martinmas celebrates the end of the agrarian year and the beginning of the winter period.

Among [[Estonia]]ns, Martinmas also marks the end of the period of [[All Souls' Day|All Souls]], as well as the autumn period in the Estonian popular calendar when the souls of ancestors were worshiped, a period that lasted from November 1 to Martinmas (November 11). On this day children disguise themselves as men and go from door to door, singing songs and telling jokes to receive sweets.

In Southern Estonia, November is called ''Märtekuu'' after St. Martin's Day.

===Germany===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 194-0273-38, Sankt Martinszug.jpg|thumb|250px|St. Martin's [[procession]] with children carrying [[paper lantern]]s in [[West Germany]] in 1949]]
[[File:Martinszug und Martinsfeuer Konz 2016.webm|thumb|thumbtime=36|250px|Martin's procession and Martin's [[bonfire]], [[Konz]], [[Germany]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] 2016]]
A widespread custom in Germany is [[bonfire]]s on St. Martin's eve, called "Martinsfeuer."  In recent years, the processions that accompany those fires have been spread over almost a fortnight before Martinmas. At one time, the Rhine River valley would be lined with fires on the eve of Martinmas. In the Rhineland region, Martin's day is celebrated traditionally with a get-together during which a roasted suckling pig is shared with the neighbours.

The nights before and on the night of Nov. 11, children walk in processions carrying lanterns, which they made in school, and sing Martin songs. Usually, the walk starts at a church and goes to a public square. A man on horseback dressed like St. Martin accompanies the children. When they reach the square, Martin's bonfire is lit and Martin's pretzels are distributed.&lt;ref name=kaiserlautern&gt;[http://kaiserslauternamerican.com/st-martins-day-traditions-honor-missionary/ "St. Martin’s Day traditions honor missionary", ''Kaiserlautern American'', 7 November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some regions of Germany (e.g. [[Rhineland]] or [[Bergisches Land]]) in a separate procession the children also go from house to house with their lanterns, sing songs and get candy in return.

The origin of the procession of lanterns is unclear. To some, it is a substitute for the St. Martin bonfire, which is still lit in a few cities and villages throughout Europe. It formerly symbolized the light that holiness brings to the darkness, just as St. Martin brought hope to the poor through his good deeds. Even though the tradition of the large, crackling fire is gradually being lost, the procession of lanterns is still practiced.&lt;ref name=missions&gt;[http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/04__W__t__G/01/08__St__Martin/St__Martin__S.html "Celebrating St. Martin's Day on November 11", German Missions in the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106012241/http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/04__W__t__G/01/08__St__Martin/St__Martin__S.html |date=2012-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of the [[Roast goose|St. Martin's goose]] or "Martinsgans", which is typically served on the evening of St. Martin's feast day following the procession of lanterns, most likely evolved from the well-known legend of St. Martin and the geese. "Martinsgans" is usually served in restaurants, roasted, with red cabbage and dumplings.&lt;ref name=missions/&gt;

In some regions of Germany, the traditional sweet of Martinmas is "Martinshörnchen", a pastry shaped in the form of a [[croissant]], which recalls both the hooves of St. Martin's horse and, by being the half of a [[pretzel]], the parting of his mantle. In parts of western Germany these pastries are instead shaped like men ([[Stutenkerl]] or Weckmänner).

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, St. Martin's Day is known as ''Martinmas'' (or sometimes ''Martlemass''). It is one of the [[Scottish Term Day|term days]] in [[Scotland]], where some schools celebrate St. Martin's day. The ancient Scottish universities' autumn term was traditionally called Martinmas term (now semester at the University of St Andrews), as opposed to Michaelmas in England. Many schools are also named after St. Martin.

Martlemass beef was from cattle slaughtered at Martinmas and salted or otherwise preserved for the winter. The now largely archaic term "St. Martin's Summer" referred to the fact that in Britain people often believed there was a brief warm spell common around the time of St. Martin's Day, before the winter months began in earnest. A similar term that originated in America is "[[Indian summer|Indian Summer]]".

In the United Kingdom, however, St. Martin's day is not widely recognised and November 11 is better known for being [[Remembrance Day]].

===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], on the eve of St. Martin's Day, it is tradition to sacrifice a [[cockerel]] by bleeding it.  The blood was collected and sprinkled on the four corners of the house.  Also in Ireland, no wheel of any kind was to turn on St. Martin's Day, because Martin was thrown into a mill stream and killed by the wheel and so it was not right to turn any kind of wheel on that day.

In [[Northern Ireland]] the village and surrounding parish of [[Desertmartin]] owes its name to [[Columba|Saint Columba]] (also referred to as Colmcille) who visited there in the sixth century.  He erected a church there as a retreat and named it in honour of St. Martin.  Hence the name in [[Irish language|Irish]] ''Díseart Mhartain'' or 'Retreat of Martin'.

===Sicily===
In Sicily, November is the winemaking season. On St. Martin's Day Sicilians eat anise biscuits washed down with Moscato, Malvasia or Passito. More precisely, the hard biscuits are dipped into the Moscato. ''l'Estate di San Martino'' (Saint Martin's Summer) is the traditional Sicilian reference to a period of unseasonably warm weather in early to mid November. Saint Martin's Day is celebrated in a special way in a village near Messina and at a monastery dedicated to him overlooking Palermo beyond Monreale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art357.htm Gangi, Roberta. "The Joys of St Martin's Summer", ''Best of Sicily Magazine'', 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latvia===
'''[[Mārtiņi]]''' (Martin's) is traditionally celebrated by Latvians on November 10, marking the end of the preparations for winter, such as salting meat and fish, storing the harvest and making preserves. Mārtiņi also marks the beginning of masquerading and sledding, among other winter activities.

=== Malta ===
[[File:Borza 1.JPG|thumb|A Maltese "Borża ta' San Martin"]]

St. Martin's Day (''Jum San Martin'' in [[Maltese language|Maltese]]) is celebrated in [[Malta]] on the Sunday nearest to November 11. Children are given a bag full of fruits and sweets associated with the feast, known by the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] as ''Il-Borża ta' San Martin'', "St. Martin's bag". This bag may include [[Walnut#Fruit|walnuts]], [[hazelnut]]s, [[almond]]s, [[Chestnut#Culinary|chestnuts]], [[Common fig#Cultivation and uses|dried or processed figs]], seasonal fruit (like [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[tangerine]]s, [[apple]]s and [[pomegranate]]s) and "[[Maltese cuisine#.C4.A6ob.C5.BCa ta.27 San Martin .28Saint Martin.27s bread roll.29|Saint Martin's bread roll]]" (Maltese: ''Ħobża ta' San Martin''). In old days, nuts were used by the children in their games.

There is a traditional [[rhyme]] associated with this custom:

                   {{quotation|Ġewż, Lewż, Qastan, Tin&lt;br /&gt;
                   Kemm inħobbu lil San Martin.

                   (Walnuts, Almonds, Chestnuts, Figs&lt;br /&gt;
                   I love Saint Martin so much.)}}

A feast is celebrated in the village of [[Baħrija]] on the outskirts of [[Rabat]] ([[Malta]]), including a procession led by the statue of Saint Martin. There is also a fair, and a show for local animals. [[San Anton School]], a private school on the island, organises a walk to and from a cave especially associated with Martin in remembrance of the day.

A number of places in Malta are named after this saint, including San Martin on the outskirts of [[St. Paul's Bay]], and Ġebel San Martin outside of [[Żejtun]].

=== Netherlands ===
[[File:Sunte-Marten.jpg|thumb|Children going door to door with [[paper lantern]]s on St. Martin's Day in the Netherlands]]
The day is celebrated on the evening of the 11th of November (the day [[Saint Martin]] died), where he is known as Sint-Maarten. As soon it gets dark, children up to the age of 11 or 12 (primary school age) go door to door with hand-crafted lanterns made of hollowed-out [[Beta vulgaris|sugar beet]] or, more recently, paper, singing songs such as "Sinte Sinte Maarten," to receive candy or fruit in return. In the past, poor people would visit farms on the 11th of November to get food for the winter. In the 1600s, the city of Amsterdam held boat races on the lake IJ. 400 to 500 light craft, both rowing boats and sailboats, took part under the eyes of a vast crowd on the banks.

===Poland===
[[File:Festive procession of Saint Martin05.jpg|thumb|Procession of Saint Martin in Poznań, 2006]]
In Poland, November 11 is the [[National Independence Day (Poland)|National Independence Day]]. St. Martin's Day is celebrated mainly in the city of [[Poznań]]. On November 11, the people of Poznań buy and eat considerable amounts of "[[St. Martin's Croissant|Rogale]]" (pronounced Ro-gah-leh), locally produced [[croissant]]s, made specially for this occasion, filled with almond paste with white poppy seeds, so-called "[[St. Martin's Croissant|Rogal świętomarciński]]" or ''Martin Croissants'' or ''St. Martin Croissants''. Legend has it this centuries-old tradition commemorates a Poznań baker's dream. His nighttime reveries had St. Martin entering the city on a white horse that lost its golden horseshoe. The very next morning, the baker whipped up horseshoe-shaped croissants filled with almonds, white poppy seeds and nuts, and gave them to the poor. In recent years, competition amongst local bakeries has become fierce for producing the best "Rogale," and very often bakeries proudly display a certificate of compliance with authentic, traditional recipes. Poznanians celebrate with a feast, specially organised by the city. There are different concerts, a St. Martin's [[parade]] and a [[fireworks]] show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/holidaysfestivals/a/stmartinsday.htm "St. Martin's Day Celebrations"]&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Święty Marcin|Saint Martin Street in Poznań]].

===Portugal===
In Portugal, St. Martin's Day is commonly associated with the celebration of the maturation of the year's wine, being traditionally the first day when the new wine can be tasted. It is celebrated, traditionally around a [[bonfire]], eating the ''magusto'', [[chestnuts]] roasted under the embers of the bonfire (sometimes dry [[figs]] and [[walnuts]]), and drinking a local light alcoholic beverage called ''água-pé'' (literally "foot water", made by adding water to the [[pomace]] left after the juice is [[pressed (wine)|pressed]] out of the grapes for wine – traditionally by [[grape stomping|stomping]] on them in vats with bare feet, and letting it ferment for several days), or the stronger ''jeropiga'' (a sweet [[liquor]] obtained in a very similar fashion, with [[aguardente]] added to the water). ''Água-pé'', though no longer available for sale in supermarkets and similar outlets (it is officially banned for sale in Portugal), is still generally available in small local shops from domestic production.

[[José Leite de Vasconcelos|Leite de Vasconcelos]] regarded the ''magusto'' as the vestige of an ancient sacrifice to honor the dead and stated that it was tradition in [[Barqueiros]] to prepare, at midnight, a table with chestnuts for the deceased family members to eat.&lt;ref&gt;Leite de Vasconcelos, Opúsculos Etnologia — volumes VII, Lisboa, Imprensa Nacional, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; The people also mask their faces with the dark wood ashes from the bonfire.
A typical Portuguese saying related to Saint Martin's Day:

{{quotation|É dia de São Martinho;&lt;br /&gt;comem-se castanhas, prova-se o vinho.&lt;br /&gt;(It is St. Martin's Day,&lt;br /&gt;we'll eat chestnuts, we'll taste the wine.)}}

This period is also quite popular because of the usual good weather period that occurs in Portugal in this time of year, called ''Verão de São Martinho'' (St. Martin's Summer). It is frequently tied to the legend since Portuguese versions of St. Martin's legend usually replace the snowstorm with rain (because snow is not frequent in most parts of Portugal, while rain is common at that time of the year) and have Jesus bringing the end of it, thus making the "summer" a gift from God.

===Spain===
In Spain, St. Martin's Day is the traditional day for slaughtering fattened pigs for the winter.  This tradition has given way to the popular saying "''A cada cerdo le llega su San Martín''" from Galician "''A cada porquiño chégalle o seu San Martiño''" , which translates as "Every pig gets its St Martin."  The phrase is used to indicate that wrongdoers eventually get their comeuppance. Saint Martin is widely celebrated in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].

=== Sint Maarten / Saint Martin ===

===Sweden===
St Martin's Day was an important medieval autumn feast, and the custom of eating goose spread to Sweden from France. In early November, geese are ready for slaughter, and on St. Martin's Eve (Mårtensafton), November 10, it is time for the traditional dinner of roast goose. The custom is particularly popular in Skåne in southern Sweden, where goose farming has long been practised, but it has gradually spread northwards. A proper [[Roast goose#European|goose dinner]] also includes svartsoppa (a heavily spiced soup made from geese blood) and apple [[Charlotte (cake)|charlotte]].&lt;ref name=tidholm&gt;[https://sweden.se/culture-traditions/st-martins-day-%e2%88%92-or-marten-gas/ "Mårten Gås", Sweden.SE]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
Its celebration has mainly remained a tradition in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Catholic region of the [[Ajoie]] in the [[canton of Jura]]. The traditional [[gargantua]]n feast, the ''Repas du Saint Martin'', includes all the parts of freshly butchered pigs, accompanied by shots of [[Damassine]], and lasting for at least 5 hours.

===United States===
In the United States, St. Martin's Day celebrations are uncommon, and when they do happen, reflect the ancestral cultural heritage of a local community.

Many German restaurants feature a traditional menu with goose and gluhwein (a mulled red wine). St. Paul, Minnesota celebrates with a traditional lantern procession around Rice Park. The evening includes German treats and traditions that highlight the season of giving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/family-weekend-fun-como-conservatory-centennial-mini-maker-faire-st-martin-s-day/340953751/ "St. Martin's Day", ''St. Paul Star Tribune'', November 5, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;  In Dayton, Ohio the Dayton Liederkranz-Turner organization hosts a St. Martin's Family Celebration on the weekend before with an evening lantern parade to the singing of St. Martin's carols, followed by a bonfire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daytongermanclub.org/? q=node/658 "St. Martin’s Day Family Celebration", Dayton Liederkranz-Turner]&lt;/ref&gt;
