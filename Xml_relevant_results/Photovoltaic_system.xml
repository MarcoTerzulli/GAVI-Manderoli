A '''photovoltaic system''', also '''PV system''' or '''solar power system''', is a [[power system]] designed to supply usable [[solar power]] by means of [[photovoltaics]]. It consists of an arrangement of several components, including [[solar panel]]s to absorb and convert sunlight into electricity, a [[solar inverter]] to convert the output from [[direct current|direct]] to [[alternating current]], as well as [[photovoltaic mounting system|mounting]], [[solar cable|cabling]], and other electrical accessories to set up a working system. It may also use a [[solar tracking system]] to improve the system's overall performance and include an [[rechargeable battery|integrated battery solution]], as prices for storage devices are expected to decline. Strictly speaking, a '''solar array''' only encompasses the ensemble of solar panels, the visible part of the PV system, and does not include all the other hardware, often summarized as [[balance of system]] (BOS). As PV systems convert light directly into electricity, they are not to  be confused with other solar technologies, such as [[concentrated solar power]] or [[Solar thermal energy|solar thermal]], used for heating and cooling.

PV systems range from small, [[rooftop photovoltaic power station|rooftop-mounted]] or [[building-integrated photovoltaics|building-integrated]] systems with capacities from a few to several tens of kilowatts, to large [[photovoltaic power station|utility-scale power station]]s of hundreds of megawatts. Nowadays, most PV systems are [[grid-connected photovoltaic power system|grid-connected]], while off-grid or [[Stand-alone power system|stand-alone systems]] account for a small portion of the market.

Operating silently and without any moving parts or [[Air pollution|environmental emissions]], PV systems have developed from being niche market applications into a mature technology used for mainstream electricity generation. A rooftop system [[Crystalline silicon#Energy payback time|recoups]] the invested energy for its manufacturing and installation within 0.7 to 2 years and produces about 95 percent of net clean [[renewable energy]] over a 30-year service lifetime.&lt;ref name=Fraunhofer-PR-2014 /&gt;{{rp|30}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/legosti/fy97/22572.pdf Service Lifetime Prediction for Encapsulated Photovoltaic Cells/Minimodules], A.W. Czanderna and G.J. Jorgensen, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Golden, CO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Economics-of-PV-Liebreich /&gt;

Due to the [[growth of photovoltaics]], prices for PV systems have rapidly declined since their introduction. However, they vary by market and the size of the system. In 2014, prices for residential 5-kilowatt [[Solar power in the United States|systems in the United States]] were around $3.29 per watt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62558.pdf |title=Photovoltaic System Pricing Trends – Historical, Recent, and Near-Term Projections, 2014 Edition |publisher=NREL |page=4 |date=22 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XOoaSCpl?url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62558.pdf |archivedate=29 March 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the highly penetrated [[Solar power in Germany|German market]], prices for rooftop systems of up to 100&amp;nbsp;kW declined to €1.24 per watt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photovoltaik-guide.de/pv-preisindex |title=Photovoltaik-Preisindex |trans-title=Solar PV price index |publisher=PhotovoltaikGuide |quote=Turnkey net-prices for a solar PV system of up to 100 kilowatts amounted to Euro 1,240 per kWp. |access-date=30 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710020014/http://www.photovoltaik-guide.de/pv-preisindex |archive-date=10 July 2017 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, solar PV modules account for less than half of the system's overall cost,&lt;ref&gt;Fraunhofer ISE [http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/publications/veroeffentlichungen-pdf-dateien-en/studien-und-konzeptpapiere/study-levelized-cost-of-electricity-renewable-energies.pdf Levelized Cost of Electricity] Study, November 2013, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the rest to the remaining BOS-components and to soft costs, which include customer acquisition, permitting, inspection and interconnection, installation labor and financing costs.&lt;ref name=IEA-roadmap-PV-2014 /&gt;{{rp|14}}

=== Overview ===
[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|Diagram of the possible components of a photovoltaic system]]

A [[photovoltaic]] system converts the sun's [[solar radiation|radiation]], in the form of light, into usable [[electricity]]. It comprises the solar array and the balance of system components. PV systems can be categorized by various aspects, such as, [[Grid-connected photovoltaic power system|grid-connected]] vs. [[Stand alone power system|stand alone]] systems, building-integrated vs. rack-mounted systems, residential vs. utility systems, [[Distributed generation|distributed]] vs. centralized systems, rooftop vs. ground-mounted systems, tracking vs. fixed-tilt systems, and new constructed vs. [[retrofitted]] systems. Other distinctions may include, systems with microinverters vs. central inverter, systems using [[crystalline silicon]] vs. [[thin-film solar cell|thin-film technology]], and systems with modules from Chinese vs. European and U.S.-manufacturers.

About 99 percent of all European and 90 percent of all U.S. solar power systems are connected to the [[electrical grid]], while off-grid systems are somewhat more common in Australia and South Korea.&lt;ref name=epia-outlook-2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Market Outlook for Photovoltaics 2014-2018|url=http://www.epia.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/EPIA_Global_Market_Outlook_for_Photovoltaics_2014-2018_-_Medium_Res.pdf|website=www.epia.org|publisher=EPIA - European Photovoltaic Industry Association|accessdate=12 June 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QGSvAF7w?url=http://www.epia.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Publications/EPIA_Global_Market_Outlook_for_Photovoltaics_2014-2018_-_Medium_Res.pdf|archivedate=12 June 2014|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} PV systems rarely use battery storage. This may change, as government incentives for distributed energy storage are implemented and investments in storage solutions gradually become economically viable for small systems.&lt;ref name=ethz-harvard&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A typical residential solar array is rack-mounted on the roof, rather than integrated into the roof or facade of the building, which is significantly more expensive. Utility-scale [[Photovoltaic power station|solar power station]]s are ground-mounted, with fixed tilted solar panels rather than using expensive tracking devices.

=== Grid-connection ===
{{Main|Grid-connected photovoltaic power system}}
[[File:PV-system-schematics-residential-Eng.png|thumb|240px|Schematics of a typical residential PV system]]

A grid connected system is connected to a larger independent grid (typically the public electricity grid) and feeds energy directly into the grid. This energy may be shared by a residential or commercial building before or after the revenue measurement point, depending on whether the credited energy production is calculated independently of the customer's energy consumption ([[feed-in tariff]]) or only on the difference of energy ([[net metering]]). These systems vary in size from residential (2–10&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) to solar power stations (up to 10s of MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;). This is a form of [[decentralized electricity generation]]. Feeding electricity into the grid requires the transformation of DC into AC by a special, synchronising [[grid-tie inverter]]. In kilowatt-sized installations the DC side system voltage is as high as permitted (typically 1000 V except US residential 600&amp;nbsp;V) to limit ohmic losses. Most modules (60 or 72 crystalline silicon cells) generate 160&amp;nbsp;W to 300&amp;nbsp;W at 36 volts. It is sometimes necessary or desirable to connect the modules partially in parallel rather than all in series. An individual set of modules connected in series is known as a 'string'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.homepower.com/view/?file=HP113_pg106_WordPower |title=Photovoltaic... Cell, Module, String, Array |format=PDF |work=WordPower—Ian Woofenden |date=2006 |accessdate=December 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scale of system ===

Photovoltaic systems are generally categorized into three distinct market segments: residential rooftop, commercial rooftop, and ground-mount utility-scale systems. Their capacities range from a few kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts. A typical residential system is around 10 kilowatts and mounted on a sloped roof, while commercial systems may reach a megawatt-scale and are generally installed on low-slope or even flat roofs. Although rooftop mounted systems are small and have a higher [[cost per watt]] than large utility-scale installations, they account for the largest share in the market. There is, however, a growing trend towards bigger utility-scale power plants, especially in the "sunbelt" region of the planet.&lt;ref name=epia-outlook-2014 /&gt;{{rp|43}}&lt;ref&gt;NREL.gov [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/53347.pdf Residential, Commercial, and Utility-Scale Photovoltaic (PV) System Prices in the United States], p.6 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

; Utility-scale

[[File:Perovosolarstation.jpg|thumb|[[Perovo Solar Park]] in Ukraine]]

: Large utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station|solar parks or farms]] are [[power station]]s and capable of providing an energy supply to large numbers of consumers. [[Electricity generation|Generated electricity]] is fed into the transmission grid powered by central generation plants (grid-connected or grid-tied plant), or combined with one, or many, domestic electricity generators to feed into a small [[electrical grid]] (hybrid plant). In rare cases generated electricity is stored or used directly by island/standalone plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/consumer/solar_electricity/basics/types_of_pv.htm Types of PV systems]. Florida Solar Energy Center (FSEC), a research institute of the University of Central Florida.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rahmani, R.; Fard, M.; Shojaei, A.A.; Othman, M.F.; Yusof, R., A complete model of stand-alone photovoltaic array in MATLAB-Simulink environment, 2011 IEEE Student Conference on Research and Development (SCOReD), pp 46–51, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; PV systems are generally designed in order to ensure the highest energy yield for a given investment. Some large photovoltaic power stations such as [[Solar Star]], [[Waldpolenz Solar Park]] and [[Topaz Solar Farm]] cover tens or hundreds of hectares and have power outputs up to hundreds of [[megawatt]]s.

: A small PV system is capable of providing enough AC electricity to power a single home, or an isolated device in the form of AC or DC electric.

Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[electric aircraft]] may contain integrated photovoltaic systems to provide a primary or [[Emergency power system|auxiliary power]] source in the form of AC or DC power, depending on the design and power demands. In 2013, rooftop systems accounted for 60 percent of worldwide installations. However, there is a trend away from rooftop and towards utility-scale PV systems, as the focus of new PV installations is also shifting from Europe to countries in the sunbelt region of the planet where opposition to ground-mounted solar farms is less accentuated.&lt;ref name=epia-outlook-2014 /&gt;{{rp|43}} Portable and mobile PV systems provide electrical power independent of utility connections, for "off the grid" operation.

=== Performance ===

Uncertainties in revenue over time relate mostly to the evaluation of the solar resource and to the performance of the system itself. In the best of cases, uncertainties are typically 4% for year-to-year climate variability, 5% for solar resource estimation (in a horizontal plane), 3% for estimation of irradiation in the plane of the array, 3% for power rating of modules, 2% for losses due to dirt and soiling, 1.5% for losses due to snow, and 5% for other sources of error. Identifying and reacting to manageable losses is critical for revenue and O&amp;M efficiency. Monitoring of array performance may be part of contractual agreements between the array owner, the builder, and the utility purchasing the energy produced. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} A method to create "synthetic days" using readily available weather data and verification using the [[Open Solar Outdoors Test Field]] make it possible to predict photovoltaic systems performance with high degrees of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2012.04.016 |bibcode=2012SoEn...86.2240A |title=Improved parametric empirical determination of module short circuit current for modelling and optimization of solar photovoltaic systems |journal=Solar Energy |volume=86 |issue=9 |pages=2240 |year=2012 |last1=Andrews |first1=Rob W |last2=Pollard |first2=Andrew |last3=Pearce |first3=Joshua M |url=https://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/materials_fp/25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method can be used to then determine loss mechanisms on a local scale - such as those from snow&lt;ref name="open access"/&gt;&lt;ref name="snow2"/&gt; or the effects of surface coatings (e.g. [[hydrophobic]] or [[hydrophilic]]) on soiling or snow losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2013.01.032 |title=A new method to determine the effects of hydrodynamic surface coatings on the snow shedding effectiveness of solar photovoltaic modules |journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells |volume=113 |pages=71–78 |year=2013 |last1=Andrews |first1=Rob W |last2=Pollard |first2=Andrew |last3=Pearce |first3=Joshua M |url=https://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/materials_fp/26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Although in heavy snow environments with severe ground interference can result in annual losses from snow of 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/JPHOTOV.2015.2466448 |title=Impact of Snow and Ground Interference on Photovoltaic Electric System Performance |journal=IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=1680 |year=2015 |last1=Heidari |first1=Negin |last2=Gwamuri |first2=Jephias |last3=Townsend |first3=Tim |last4=Pearce |first4=Joshua M |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02113582/file/Impact_of_Snow_and_Ground_Interference_o.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

For solar PV systems that use [[microinverters]] (panel-level DC to AC conversion), module power data is automatically provided. Some systems allow setting performance alerts that trigger phone/email/text warnings when limits are reached. These solutions provide data for the system owner and the installer.

[[File:Balance of System.svg|thumb|The [[balance of system]] components of a PV system (BOS) balance the power-generating subsystem of the solar array (left side) with the power-using side of the AC-household devices and the utility grid (right side).]]

A photovoltaic system for residential, commercial, or industrial energy supply consists of the solar array and a number of components often summarized as the [[balance of system]] (BOS). This term is synonymous with "[[Balance of plant]]" q.v. BOS-components include power-conditioning equipment and structures for mounting, typically one or more DC to [[alternating current|AC]] power converters, also known as [[Power inverter|inverters]], an energy storage device, a racking system that supports the solar array, electrical wiring and interconnections, and mounting for other components.

Optionally, a balance of system may include any or all of the following: [[renewable energy credit]] revenue-grade meter, [[maximum power point tracker]] (MPPT), [[Rechargeable battery|battery]] system and [[battery charger|charger]], [[GPS]] [[solar tracker]], [[energy management software]], [[solar irradiance]] sensors, [[anemometer]], or task-specific accessories designed to meet specialized requirements for a system owner. In addition, a [[Concentrated photovoltaics|CPV]] system requires [[optical lens]]es or mirrors and sometimes a cooling system.

The terms "solar array" and "PV system" are often incorrectly used interchangeably, despite the fact that the solar array does not encompass the entire system. Moreover, "solar panel" is often used as a synonym for "solar module", although a panel consists of a string of several modules. The term "[[solar system]]" is also an often used [[misnomer]] for a PV system.

=== Solar array ===
{{further|PV module}}

The building blocks of a photovoltaic system are solar cells. A solar cell is the electrical device that can directly convert photons energy into electricity. There are three technological generations of solar cells: the first generation (1G) of [[Crystalline silicon|crystalline silicon cells]] (c-Si), the second generation (2G) of [[Thin-film solar cell|thin-film]] cells (such as [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe]], [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cells|CIGS]], [[Amorphous silicon|Amorphous Silicon]], and [[Gallium arsenide|GaAs]]), and the third generation (3G) of [[Organic solar cell|organic]], [[Dye-sensitized solar cell|dye-sensitized]], [[Perovskite solar cell|Perovskite]] and [[Multi-junction solar cell|multijunction cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:gbv:46-00106546-15|title=Forging Ahead: Technology Development and Emerging Economies|last=Shubbak|first=Mahmood|date=2018|publisher=Universität Bremen|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shubbak|first=Mahmood H.|date=2019-11-01|title=Advances in solar photovoltaics: Technology review and patent trends|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|language=en|volume=115|pages=109383|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2019.109383|issn=1364-0321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional [[Crystalline silicon|c-Si]] [[solar cell]]s, normally wired in series, are encapsulated in a solar module to protect them from the weather. The module consists of a [[tempered glass]] as cover, a soft and flexible [[ethylene vinyl acetate|encapsulant]], a rear backsheet made of a weathering and fire-resistant [[Polyvinyl fluoride|material]] and an aluminium frame around the outer edge. Electrically connected and mounted on a supporting structure, solar modules build a string of modules, often called solar panel. A solar array consists of one or many such panels.&lt;ref&gt;PV Education.org [http://pveducation.org/pvcdrom/modules/module-materials Module Materials]&lt;/ref&gt; A photovoltaic array, or solar array, is a linked collection of solar modules. The power that one module can produce is seldom enough to meet requirements of a home or a business, so the modules are linked together to form an array. Most PV arrays use an [[solar inverter|inverter]] to convert the DC power produced by the modules into [[alternating current]] that can power [[light]]s, motors, and other loads. The modules in a PV array are usually first connected in [[Series circuits|series]] to obtain the desired [[voltage]]; the individual strings are then connected in [[Parallel circuits|parallel]] to allow the system to produce more [[Electric current|current]]. Solar panels are typically measured under STC (standard test conditions) or PTC (PVUSA test conditions), in [[watt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millenniumplanet.com/solar-buyers-guide.html Key Factors in selecting solar components]&lt;/ref&gt; Typical panel ratings range from less than 100 watts to over 400 watts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gosolarcalifornia.ca.gov/equipment/pv_modules.php List of Eligible SB1 Guidelines Compliant Photovoltaic Modules]&lt;/ref&gt; The array rating consists of a summation of the panel ratings, in watts, kilowatts, or megawatts.

; Module and efficiency

A typical 150 watt [[PV module]] is about a square meter in size. Such a module may be expected to produce 0.75&amp;nbsp; [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh) every day, on average, after taking into account the weather and the latitude, for an insolation of 5 sun hours/day. In the last 10 years{{when|date=October 2019}}, the efficiency of average commercial wafer-based [[crystalline silicon]] modules increased from about 12% to 16% and CdTe module efficiency increased from 9% to 13% during same period. Module output and life degraded by increased temperature. Allowing ambient air to flow over, and if possible behind, PV modules reduces this problem. Effective module lives are typically 25 years or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.agr.gc.ca/AAFC-AAC/display-afficher.do?id=1187620075153&amp;lang=eng|title=Solar Power (Photovoltaic, PV)|work=Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada|accessdate=5 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916201728/http://www4.agr.gc.ca/AAFC-AAC/display-afficher.do?id=1187620075153&amp;lang=eng|archive-date=16 September 2010|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; The payback period for an investment in a PV solar installation varies greatly and is typically less useful than a calculation of [[return on investment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/blog/post/2010/04/the-worst-metric-in-renewables-the-payback-period The Worst Metric in Renewables: 'The Payback Period'].

Due to the low voltage of an individual [[solar cell]] (typically ca. 0.5V), several cells are wired ''(also see [[Copper in renewable energy#Solar photovoltaic power generation|copper used in PV systems]])'' in series in the manufacture of a "laminate". The laminate is assembled into a protective weatherproof enclosure, thus making a photovoltaic module or [[solar panel]]. Modules may then be strung together into a photovoltaic array. In 2012, solar panels available for consumers have an efficiency of up to about 17%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sroeco.com/solar/most-efficient-solar-panels|title=Solar Panel Comparison Table |accessdate=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; while commercially available panels can go as far as 27%.

''Photovoltaic systems engineering''. CRC press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; When even a small portion of a cell, module, or array is shaded, with the remainder is in sunlight, the output falls dramatically due to internal 'short-circuiting' (the electrons reversing course through the shaded portion of the [[p-n junction]]). If the current drawn from the series string of cells is no greater than the current that can be produced by the shaded cell, the current (and so power) developed by the string is limited. If enough voltage is available from the other cells in a string, current will be forced through the cell by breaking down the junction in the shaded portion. This breakdown voltage in common cells is between 10 and 30 volts. Instead of adding to the power produced by the panel, the shaded cell absorbs power, turning it into heat. Since the reverse voltage of a shaded cell is much greater than the forward voltage of an illuminated cell, one shaded cell can absorb the power of many other cells in the string, disproportionately affecting panel output. For example, a shaded cell may drop 8 volts, instead of adding 0.5 volts, at a particular current level, thereby absorbing the power produced by 16 other cells.&lt;ref name=UE03&gt;Ursula Eicker, ''Solar Technologies for Buildings'', Wiley 2003, {{ISBN|0-471-48637-X}}, page 226&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus important that a PV installation is not shaded by trees or other obstructions.

Several methods have been developed to determine shading losses from trees to PV systems over both large regions using [[LiDAR]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2012.01.017 |bibcode=2012SoEn...86.1245N |title=Incorporating shading losses in solar photovoltaic potential assessment at the municipal scale |journal=Solar Energy |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=1245 |year=2012 |last1=Nguyen |first1=Ha T |last2=Pearce |first2=Joshua M |url=https://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1037&amp;context=materials_fp }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also at an individual system level using [[sketchup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.solener.2013.06.019 |bibcode=2013SoEn...95..300D |title=Simple and low-cost method of planning for tree growth and lifetime effects on solar photovoltaic systems performance |journal=Solar Energy |volume=95 |pages=300–307 |year=2013 |last1=Dereli |first1=Z |last2=Yücedağ |first2=C |last3=Pearce |first3=J.M |url=https://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1033&amp;context=materials_fp }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most modules have bypass diodes between each cell or string of cells that minimize the effects of shading and only lose the power of the shaded portion of the array. The main job of the bypass diode is to eliminate hot spots that form on cells that can cause further damage to the array, and cause fires. Sunlight can be absorbed by dust, snow, or other impurities at the surface of the module. This can reduce the light that strikes the cells. In general these losses aggregated over the year are small even for locations in Canada.&lt;ref name="open access"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1109/PVSC.2012.6318297 |chapter=Prediction of energy effects on photovoltaic systems due to snowfall events |title=2012 38th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference |pages=003386 |year=2012 |last1=Andrews |first1=Rob W |last2=Pearce |first2=Joshua M |isbn=978-1-4673-0066-7 |chapter-url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02120464/file/Prediction_of_Energy_Effects_on_Photovol.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining a clean module surface will increase output performance over the life of the module.

; Insolation and energy
[[File:SolarGIS-Solar-map-World-map-en.png|thumb|left|Global [[Insolation|solar potential]]]]

[[Solar insolation]] is made up of direct, diffuse, and reflected [[radiation]]. The absorption factor of a PV cell is defined as the fraction of incident solar irradiance that is absorbed by the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Santbergen|first=R|author2=R.J.C. van Zolingen|title=The absorption factor of crystalline silicon PV cells: A numerical and experimental study|journal=Solar Energy Materials &amp; Solar Cells|date=22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At high noon on a cloudless day at the equator, the power of the sun is about 1 [[kilowatt|kW]]/m²,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=El-Sharkawi|first=Mohamed A.|title=Electric energy|year=2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-3078-0|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the Earth's surface, to a plane that is perpendicular to the sun's rays. As such, PV arrays can [[solar tracker|track the sun]] through each day to greatly enhance energy collection. However, tracking devices add cost, and require maintenance, so it is more common for PV arrays to have fixed mounts that tilt the array and face [[solar noon]] (approximately due south in the Northern Hemisphere or due north in the Southern Hemisphere). The tilt angle, from horizontal, can be varied for season,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macslab.com/optsolar.html Optimum Tilt of Solar Panels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811104430/http://www.macslab.com/optsolar.html |date=2015-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but if fixed, should be set to give optimal array output during the peak electrical demand portion of a typical year for a stand-alone system. This optimal module tilt angle is not necessarily identical to the tilt angle for maximum annual array energy output.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/en/publications/pdf/FSEC-RR-54-98-2.pdf Stand Alone Photovoltaic Lighting Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; The optimization of the photovoltaic system for a specific environment can be complicated as issues of solar flux, soiling, and snow losses should be taken into effect. In addition, later work has shown that spectral effects can play a role in optimal photovoltaic material selection. For example, the spectral [[albedo]] can play a significant role in output depending on the surface around the photovoltaic system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrews | first1 = Rob W. | last2 = Pearce | first2 = Joshua M. | year = 2013 | title = The effect of spectral albedo on amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic device performance | doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2013.01.030 | bibcode = 2013SoEn...91..233A | journal = Solar Energy | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 233–241 | url = https://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&amp;context=materials_fp }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the type of solar cell material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = M.P. | last2 = Abramase | first2 = A.L. | last3 = Andrews | first3 = R.W. | last4 = Pearce | first4 = J.

A photovoltaic installation in the southern latitudes of Europe or the United States may expect to produce 1 kWh/m²/day. A typical 1&amp;nbsp;kW photovoltaic installation in Australia or the southern latitudes of Europe or United States, may produce 3.5–5&amp;nbsp;kWh per day, dependent on location, orientation, tilt, insolation and other factors.

Modules are assembled into arrays on some kind of mounting system, which may be classified as ground mount, roof mount or pole mount. For [[solar park]]s a large rack is mounted on the ground, and the modules mounted on the rack.
For buildings, many different racks have been devised for pitched roofs. For flat roofs, racks, bins and building integrated solutions are used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Solar panel racks mounted on top of poles can be stationary or moving, see Trackers below. Side-of-pole mounts are suitable for situations where a pole has something else mounted at its top, such as a light fixture or an antenna. Pole mounting raises what would otherwise be a ground mounted array above weed shadows and livestock, and may satisfy electrical code requirements regarding inaccessibility of exposed wiring. Pole mounted panels are open to more cooling air on their underside, which increases performance. A multiplicity of pole top racks can be formed into a parking carport or other shade structure. A rack which does not follow the sun from left to right may allow seasonal adjustment up or down.

=== Cabling ===
{{main|Solar cable|Electrical wiring}}

Due to their outdoor usage, [[solar cable]]s are designed to be resistant against [[UV]] radiation and extremely high temperature fluctuations and are generally unaffected by the weather. Standards specifying the usage of [[electrical wiring]] in PV systems include the [[IEC 60364]] by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]], in section 712 "Solar photovoltaic (PV) power supply systems", the British Standard [[BS 7671]], incorporating regulations relating to [[microgeneration]] and photovoltaic systems, and the US [[Solar cable#UL4703 standard|UL4703 standard]], in subject 4703 "Photovoltaic Wire".

[[File:ZomeworksTrackerHead5816.jpg|thumb|left|A 1998 model of a passive solar tracker, viewed from underneath.]]

A [[solar tracker|solar tracking system]] tilts a solar panel throughout the day. Depending on the type of tracking system, the panel is either aimed directly at the sun or the brightest area of a partly clouded sky. Trackers greatly enhance early morning and late afternoon performance, increasing the total amount of power produced by a system by about 20–25% for a single axis tracker and about 30% or more for a dual axis tracker, depending on latitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/calculators/PVWATTS/version1/ A Performance Calculator].

Trackers are effective in regions that receive a large portion of sunlight directly. In diffuse light (i.e. under cloud or fog), tracking has little or no value. Because most [[concentrated photovoltaics]] systems are very sensitive to the sunlight's angle, tracking systems allow them to produce useful power for more than a brief period each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Al-Mohamad | first1 = Ali | year = 2004 | title = Efficiency improvements of photo-voltaic panels using a Sun-tracking system | url = | journal = Applied Energy | volume = 79 | issue = 3| pages = 345–354 | doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2003.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking systems improve performance for two main reasons. First, when a solar panel is perpendicular to the sunlight, it receives more light on its surface than if it were angled. Second, direct light is used more efficiently than angled light.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtu.edu/news/stories/2015/october/shining-more-light-solar-panels.html Shining More Light on Solar Panels]. mtu.edu.

Trackers and sensors to optimise the performance are often seen as optional, but they can increase viable output by up to 45%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solartown.com/learning/solar-panels/beginners-guide-to-solar-trackers-how-to-increase-output-for-your-home-solar-panel-system/ Beginners' Guide to Solar Trackers: How to Increase Output for Your Home Solar Panel System], 17 August 2011 ([https://www.webcitation.org/6Sqbm9QvL?url=http://www.solartown.com/learning/solar-panels/beginners-guide-to-solar-trackers-how-to-increase-output-for-your-home-solar-panel-system/ archived])&lt;/ref&gt; Arrays that approach or exceed one megawatt often use solar trackers. Considering clouds, and the fact that most of the world is not on the equator, and that the sun sets in the evening, the correct measure of solar power is [[insolation]] – the average number of kilowatt-hours per square meter per day. For the weather and latitudes of the United States and Europe, typical insolation ranges from 2.26&amp;nbsp;kWh/m²/day in northern climes to 5.61&amp;nbsp;kWh/m²/day in the sunniest regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.apricus.com/html/insolation_levels_europe.htm |title=Insolation Levels (Europe) |access-date=2012-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417024757/http://www.apricus.com/html/insolation_levels_europe.htm |archive-date=2012-04-17 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.porta-energy.com/Insolation_USA.htm 10 years Average Insolation Data]&lt;/ref&gt;

For large systems, the energy gained by using tracking systems can outweigh the added complexity. For [[Very large scale solar power plant|very large systems]], the added maintenance of tracking is a substantial detriment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/04b38b804a178f13b377ffdd29332b51/SOLAR%2BGUIDE%2BBOOK.pdf?MOD=AJPERES Utility Scale Solar Power Plants]&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking is not required for flat panel and low-concentration [[Concentrated photovoltaics|photovoltaic system]]s. For high-concentration photovoltaic systems, dual axis tracking is a necessity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helmholz.us/smallpowersystems/Intro.pdf Should You Install a Solar Tracker?]&lt;/ref&gt; Pricing trends affect the balance between adding more stationary solar panels versus having fewer panels that track.

As  pricing, reliability and performance of single-axis trackers have improved, the systems have been installed in an increasing percentage of utility-scale projects. According to data from WoodMackenzie/GTM Research, global solar tracker shipments hit a record 14.5 gigawatts in 2017. This represents growth of 32 percent year-over-year, with similar or greater growth projected as large-scale solar deployment accelerates.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/global-solar-tracker-shipments-grow-32-in-2017-nextracker-leads-the-market#gs.nqu7o0LU&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inverter ===
{{main|Solar inverter|Solar micro-inverter|Power inverter}}
[[File:Central inverter cutout.jpg|thumb|Central inverter with AC and DC disconnects (on the side), monitoring gateway, transformer isolation and interactive LCD.]]

[[File:Vermont Law School Solar Panel Array-4.JPG|thumb|left|String inverter (left), generation meter, and AC disconnect (right). A modern 2013 installation in [[Vermont]], United States.]]

Systems designed to deliver [[alternating current]] (AC), such as [[Photovoltaic system#Grid-connected applications|grid-connected applications]] need an inverter to convert the [[direct current]] (DC) from the solar modules to AC. Grid connected inverters must supply AC electricity in sinusoidal form, synchronized to the grid frequency, limit feed in voltage to no higher than the grid voltage and disconnect from the grid if the grid voltage is turned off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepower.com/article/?file=HP130_pg28_ATE_2 Grid-Tied Inverter Safety]. Homepower.com. Retrieved on 2012-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Islanding inverters need only produce regulated voltages and frequencies in a sinusoidal waveshape as no synchronisation or co-ordination with grid supplies is required.

A [[solar inverter]] may connect to a string of solar panels. In some installations a [[solar micro-inverter]] is connected at each solar panel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartplanet.com/blog/intelligent-energy/trend-watch-microinverters-invade-solar/9707 Trend watch: Microinverters invade solar]&lt;/ref&gt; For safety reasons a circuit breaker is provided both on the AC and DC side to enable maintenance. AC output may be connected through an [[electricity meter]] into the public grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515213135/http://www.schurter.com/content/download/244246/7047074/version/3/file/Solar_Technology_wp_us.pdf Services and Solutions for Photovoltaic Systems]&lt;/ref&gt; The number of [[Modular design|module]]s in the system determines the total DC watts capable of being generated by the solar array; however, the inverter ultimately governs the amount of AC watts that can be distributed for consumption. For example, a PV system comprising 11 [[kilowatt]]s DC (kW&lt;sub&gt;DC&lt;/sub&gt;) worth of PV modules, paired with one 10-kilowatt AC (kW&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;) inverter, will be limited to the inverter's output of 10&amp;nbsp;kW. As of 2014, conversion efficiency for state-of-the-art converters reached more than 98 percent. While string inverters are used in residential to medium-sized commercial PV systems, central inverters cover the large commercial and utility-scale market. Market-share for central and string inverters are about 50 percent and 48 percent, respectively, with less than 2 percent for micro-inverters.&lt;ref name="fraunhofer-report-september-2014" /&gt;

[[Maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT) is a technique that grid connected inverters use to get the maximum possible power from the photovoltaic array. In order to do so, the inverter's MPPT system digitally samples the solar array's ever changing power output and applies the proper resistance to find the optimal ''maximum power point''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.solar-electric.com [http://www.solar-electric.com/mppt-solar-charge-controllers.html All About Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-islanding]] is a protection mechanism to immediately shut down the inverter,  preventing it from generating AC power when the connection to the load no longer exists. This happens, for example, in the case of a blackout. Without this protection, the supply line would become an "island" with power surrounded by a "sea" of unpowered lines, as the solar array continues to deliver DC power during the power outage. Islanding is a hazard to utility workers, who may not realize that an AC circuit is still powered, and it may prevent automatic re-connection of devices.&lt;ref&gt;EDN.com [http://www.edn.com/design/systems-design/4391907/Product-How-To--Solar-power-anti-islanding-and-control Solar power anti-islanding and control], 7 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battery ===
{{main|Rechargeable battery|Battery (electricity)}}
Although still expensive, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night. [[Grid energy storage#Batteries|Batteries used for grid-storage]] also stabilize the [[electrical grid]] by [[Grid energy storage#Load leveling|leveling out peak loads]], and play an important role in a [[smart grid]], as they can charge during periods of low demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is high.

Common battery technologies used in today's PV systems include the [[valve regulated lead-acid battery]]– a modified version of the conventional [[lead–acid battery]], [[nickel–cadmium battery|nickel–cadmium]] and [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion]] batteries. Compared to the other types, lead-acid batteries have a shorter lifetime and lower energy density. However, due to their high reliability, low self discharge as well as low investment and maintenance costs, they are currently the predominant technology used in small-scale, residential PV systems, as lithium-ion batteries are still being developed and about 3.5 times as expensive as lead-acid batteries. Furthermore, as storage devices for PV systems are stationary, the lower energy and power density and therefore higher weight of lead-acid batteries are not as critical as, for example, in [[Electric vehicle|electric transportation]]&lt;ref name=ethz-harvard /&gt;{{rp|4,9}} Other rechargeable batteries  considered for distributed PV systems include [[Sodium–sulfur battery|sodium–sulfur]] and [[Vanadium redox battery|vanadium redox]] batteries, two prominent types of a [[Molten salt battery|molten salt]] and a [[Flow battery|flow]] battery, respectively.&lt;ref name=ethz-harvard /&gt;{{rp|4}} In 2015, Tesla Motors launched the [[Powerwall (Tesla)|Powerwall]], a rechargeable lithium-ion battery with the aim to revolutionize energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Associated Press |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tesla-launches-powerwall-home-battery-with-aim-to-revolutionize-energy-consumption-1.3056587 |title=Tesla launches Powerwall home battery with aim to revolutionize energy consumption |date=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PV systems with an integrated battery solution also need a [[charge controller]], as the varying voltage and current from the solar array requires constant adjustment to prevent damage from overcharging.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Fink, www.homepower.com [http://www.homepower.com/articles/solar-electricity/equipment-products/2012-charge-controller-buyers-guide Charge Controller Buyer's Guide], January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Basic charge controllers may simply turn the PV panels on and off, or may meter out pulses of energy as needed, a strategy called PWM or [[pulse-width modulation]]. More advanced charge controllers will incorporate [[Maximum power point tracking|MPPT]] logic into their battery charging algorithms. Charge controllers may also divert energy to some purpose other than battery charging. Rather than simply shut off the free PV energy when not needed, a user may choose to heat air or water once the battery is full.

=== Monitoring and metering ===

{{main|Net metering|Energy metering|Smart meter}}
The metering must be able to accumulate energy units in both directions, or two meters must be used. Many meters accumulate bidirectionally, some systems use two meters, but a unidirectional meter (with detent) will not accumulate energy from any resultant feed into the grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarelectricpower.org/media/84144/sepa%20pv%20metering.pdf Residential Photovoltaic Metering and Interconnection Study]&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, for installations over 30 [[Nominal power (photovoltaic)#Watt-peak|kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;]] a frequency and a voltage monitor with disconnection of all phases is required. This is done where more solar power is being generated than can be accommodated by the utility, and the excess can not either be exported or [[Grid energy storage|stored]]. Grid operators historically have needed to provide transmission lines and generation capacity. Now they need to also provide storage. This is normally hydro-storage, but other means of storage are used. Initially storage was used so that baseload generators could operate at full output. With [[variable renewable energy]], storage is needed to allow power generation whenever it is available, and consumption whenever needed. [[File:Stromzähler in Kanada.JPG|thumb|left|A Canadian electricity meter]]
The two variables a grid operator have are storing electricity for ''when'' it is needed, or transmitting it to ''where'' it is needed. If both of those fail, installations over 30kWp can automatically shut down, although in practice all inverters maintain voltage regulation and stop supplying power if the load is inadequate. Grid operators have the option of curtailing excess generation from large systems, although this is more commonly done with wind power than solar power, and results in a substantial loss of revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/53732.pdf Integrating Variable Renewable Energy in Electric Power Markets]&lt;/ref&gt; Three-phase inverters have the unique option of supplying reactive power which can be advantageous in matching load requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2012/01/smart-pv-inverter-benefits-for-utilities Smart PV Inverter Benefits for Utilities]&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoltaic systems need to be monitored to detect breakdown and optimize operation. There are several [[Photovoltaic system performance|photovoltaic monitoring]] strategies depending on the output of the installation and its nature. Monitoring can be performed on site or remotely. It can measure production only, retrieve all the data from the inverter or retrieve all of the data from the communicating equipment (probes, meters, etc.). Monitoring tools can be dedicated to supervision only or offer additional functions. Individual inverters and battery charge controllers may include monitoring using manufacturer specific protocols and software.&lt;ref&gt;[https://enphase.com/en-us/products-and-services/enlighten-and-apps Enphase Solar Monitoring]&lt;/ref&gt; Energy metering of an inverter may be of limited accuracy and not suitable for revenue metering purposes. A third-party data acquisition system can monitor multiple inverters, using the inverter manufacturer's protocols, and also acquire weather-related information. Independent [[smart meter]]s may measure the total energy production of a PV array system. Separate measures such as satellite image analysis or a solar radiation meter (a [[pyranometer]]) can be used to estimate total insolation for comparison.&lt;ref&gt;[https://buildingsfieldtest.nrel.gov/solar_irradiance_measurements Solar Irradiance Measurements]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Data collected from a monitoring system can be displayed remotely over the World Wide Web, such as [[OSOTF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearce|first=Joshua.

== Other systems ==

This section includes systems that are either highly specialized and uncommon or still an emerging new technology with limited significance. However, [[Stand-alone power system|standalone]] or off-grid systems take a special place. They were the most common type of systems during the 1980s and 1990s, when PV technology was still very expensive and a pure niche market of small scale applications. Only in places where no electrical grid was available, they were economically viable. Although new stand-alone systems are still being deployed all around the world, their contribution to the overall installed photovoltaic capacity is decreasing. In Europe, off-grid systems account for 1 percent of installed capacity. In the United States, they account for about 10 percent. Off-grid systems are still common in Australia and South Korea, and in many developing countries.&lt;ref name=epia-outlook-2014 /&gt;{{rp|14}}

=== CPV ===
{{main|Concentrator photovoltaics}}
[[File:Concentració Fotovoltaica.jpg|thumb|right|[[Concentrator photovoltaic]] (CPV) in [[Catalonia]], Spain]]

Concentrator photovoltaics (CPV) and ''high concentrator photovoltaic'' (HCPV) systems use [[optical lens]]es or curved mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto small but highly efficient solar cells. Besides concentrating optics, CPV systems sometime use solar trackers and cooling systems and are more expensive.

Especially HCPV systems are best suited in location with high solar irradiance, concentrating sunlight up to 400 times or more, with efficiencies of 24–28 percent, exceeding those of regular systems. Various designs of systems are commercially available but not very common. However, ongoing research and development is taking place.&lt;ref name=Fraunhofer-PR-2014 /&gt;{{rp|26}}

CPV is often confused with CSP ([[concentrated solar power]]) that does not use photovoltaics. Both technologies favor locations that receive much sunlight and are directly competing with each other.

=== Hybrid ===

[[File:Hybrid Power System.gif|thumb|A [[Solar hybrid power systems|wind-solar PV hybrid system]]]]

A hybrid system combines PV with other forms of generation, usually a diesel generator. Biogas is also used. The other form of generation may be a type able to modulate power output as a function of demand. However more than one renewable form of energy may be used e.g. wind. The photovoltaic power generation serves to reduce the consumption of non renewable fuel. Hybrid systems are most often found on islands. [[Pellworm]] island in Germany and [[Kythnos]] island in Greece are notable examples (both are combined with wind).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvresources.com/en/hybrid.php PV resources website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128022703/http://pvresources.com/en/hybrid.php |date=2010-11-28 }}, Hybrid power station accessed 10 Feb 08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pellworm.de/energieversorgung.0.html |title=Daten und Fakten |accessdate=2008-02-10 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719072419/http://www.pellworm.de/energieversorgung.0.html |archivedate=July 19, 2011 }}.

In 2015, a case-study conducted in seven countries concluded that in all cases generating costs can be reduced by hybridising mini-grids and isolated grids. However, financing costs for such hybrids are crucial and largely depend on the ownership structure of the power plant. While cost reductions for state-owned utilities can be significant, the study also identified economic benefits to be insignificant or even negative for non-public utilities, such as [[independent power producer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2015/kw22/new-study-hybridising-electricity-grids-with-solar-pv-saves-costs-especially-benefits-state-owned-utilities.html |title=New study: Hybridising electricity grids with solar PV saves costs, especially benefits state-owned utilities |publisher=SolarServer.com |date=31 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150726213948/http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/current/2015/kw22/new-study-hybridising-electricity-grids-with-solar-pv-saves-costs-especially-benefits-state-owned-utilities.html |archivedate=26 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fs-unep-centre.org/publications/renewable-energy-hybrid-mini-grids-and-isolated-grids-economic-benefits-and-business#overlay-context=publications |title=Renewable Energy in Hybrid Mini-Grids and Isolated Grids: Economic Benefits and Business Cases |publisher=Frankfurt School – UNEP Collaborating Centre for Climate &amp; Sustainable Energy Finance |date=May 2015 |access-date=2015-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820230219/http://fs-unep-centre.org/publications/renewable-energy-hybrid-mini-grids-and-isolated-grids-economic-benefits-and-business#overlay-context=publications |archive-date=2018-08-20 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been work showing that the PV penetration limit can be increased by deploying a distributed network of PV+CHP hybrid systems in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. M. Pearce|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2009.08.012|title= Expanding Photovoltaic Penetration with Residential Distributed Generation from Hybrid Solar Photovoltaic + Combined Heat and Power Systems|journal=Energy|volume=34|issue=11|pages=1947–1954 |year=2009|hdl=1974/5307|citeseerx=10.1.1.593.8182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temporal distribution of solar flux, electrical and heating requirements for representative U.S. single family residences were analyzed and the results clearly show that hybridizing CHP with PV can enable additional PV deployment above what is possible with a conventional centralized electric generation system. This theory was reconfirmed with numerical simulations using per second solar flux data to determine that the necessary battery backup to provide for such a hybrid system is possible with relatively small and inexpensive battery systems.&lt;ref&gt;P.

=== Floating solar arrays ===
[[Floating solar]] arrays are PV systems that float on the surface of drinking water reservoirs, quarry lakes, irrigation canals or remediation and tailing ponds. These systems are called "floatovoltaics" when used only for electrical production or "aquavoltaics" when such systems are used to synergistically enhance [[aquaculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.191 |title=Aquavoltaics: Synergies for dual use of water area for solar photovoltaic electricity generation and aquaculture |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=80 |pages=572–584 |year=2017 |last1=Pringle |first1=Adam M |last2=Handler |first2=R.M |last3=Pearce |first3=J.M |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02113453/file/Aquavoltaics_Synergies_for_Dual_Use_of_W.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of such systems exist in France, India, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Singapore and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=SolarServer.com |url=http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/archive-2014/2014/kw36/kyocera-partners-announce-construction-of-the-worlds-largest-floating-solar-pv-plant-in-hyogo-prefecture-japan.html |title=Kyocera, partners announce construction of the world's largest floating solar PV Plant in Hyogo prefecture, Japan |date=4 September 2014 |access-date=1 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104333/http://www.solarserver.com/solar-magazine/solar-news/archive-2014/2014/kw36/kyocera-partners-announce-construction-of-the-worlds-largest-floating-solar-pv-plant-in-hyogo-prefecture-japan.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=EnergyWorld.com |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/11/running-out-of-precious-land-floating-solar-pv-systems-may-be-a-solution |title=Running Out of Precious Land?

The systems are said to have advantages over photovoltaics on land. The cost of land is more expensive, and there are fewer rules and regulations for structures built on bodies of water not used for recreation. Unlike most land-based solar plants, floating arrays can be unobtrusive because they are hidden from public view. They achieve higher efficiencies than PV panels on land, because water cools the panels. The panels have a special coating to prevent rust or corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;Erica Goodemay, [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/science/solar-power-floating-on-water.html?_r=0 New Solar Plants Generate Floating Green Power], ''New York Times'', 20 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, the Far Niente Winery in Oakville, California, pioneered the world's first floatovoltaic system by installing 994 solar PV modules with a total capacity of 477&amp;nbsp;kW onto 130 pontoons and floating them on the winery's irrigation pond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Winery-goes-solar-with-Floatovoltaics-3282171.php |title=Winery goes solar with Floatovoltaics |publisher=SFGate |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary benefit of such a system is that it avoids the need to sacrifice valuable land area that could be used for another purpose. In the case of the Far Niente Winery, it saved {{convert|0.75|acre}} that would have been required for a land-based system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.farniente.com/assets/files/pdfs/Floatovoltaic.pdf |title=Napa Valley's Far Niente Winery Introduces first-ever Floatovoltaic solar array |publisher=Far Niente |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316135710/http://farniente.com/assets/files/pdfs/Floatovoltaic.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another benefit of a floatovoltaic system is that the panels are kept at a cooler temperature than they would be on land, leading to a higher efficiency of solar energy conversion. The floating PV array also reduces the amount of water lost through evaporation and inhibits the growth of algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2011/08/15/napa-winery-pioneers-solar-floatovoltaics/ |title=Napa Winery Pioneers Solar Floatovoltaics |work=Forbes |date=18 April 2012 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utility-scale floating PV farms are starting to be built. The multinational electronics and ceramics manufacturer [[Kyocera]] will develop the world's largest, a 13.4&amp;nbsp;MW farm on the reservoir above Yamakura Dam in [[Chiba Prefecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://damnet.or.jp/cgi-bin/binranA/enAll.cgi?db4=0663 |publisher=The Japan Dam Foundation |title=Yamakura Dam in Chiba Prefecture |accessdate=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; using 50,000 solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.kyocera.com/news/2014/1205_dfsp.html Kyocera and Century Tokyo Leasing to Develop 13.4MW Floating Solar Power Plant on Reservoir in Chiba Prefecture, Japan], Kyocera, December 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/science/solar-power-floating-on-water.html New Solar Plants Generate Floating Green Power] NYT May 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Salt-water resistant floating farms are also being considered for ocean use, with experiments in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2015/01/150116-floating-solar-power-japan-yamakura/ Solar Panels Floating on Water Could Power Japan's Homes], ''National Geographic'', Bryan Lufkin, January 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The largest so far announced floatovoltaic project is a 350&amp;nbsp;MW power station in the Amazon region of Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2015/04/06/brazil-announces-huge-350-mw-floating-solar-power-plant/ |title=Brazil Announces Huge 350 MW Floating Solar Power Plant |website=CleanTechnica.com |author=Anand Upadhyay |date=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct current grid ===
DC grids are found in electric powered transport: railways trams and trolleybuses. A few pilot plants for such applications have been built, such as the tram depots in Hannover Leinhausen, using photovoltaic contributors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iea-pvps.org/products/download/rep7_07.pdf |title=Innovative Electrical Concepts |accessdate=2008-02-11 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318231142/http://www.iea-pvps.org/products/download/rep7_07.pdf |archivedate=March 18, 2009 }}.

A [[Stand-alone power system|stand-alone]] or off-grid system is not connected to the [[electrical grid]]. Standalone systems vary widely in size and application from [[Solar-powered watch|wristwatches]] or [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|calculators]] to remote buildings or [[Solar panels on spacecraft|spacecraft]]. If the load is to be supplied independently of solar [[insolation]], the generated power is stored and buffered with a battery. In non-portable applications where weight is not an issue, such as in buildings, [[lead acid battery|lead acid batteries]] are most commonly used for their low cost and tolerance for abuse.

A charge controller may be incorporated in the system to avoid battery damage by excessive charging or discharging. It may also help to optimize production from the solar array using a maximum power point tracking technique ([[Maximum power point tracking|MPPT]]). However, in simple PV systems where the PV module voltage is matched to the battery voltage, the use of MPPT electronics is generally considered unnecessary, since the battery voltage is stable enough to provide near-maximum power collection from the PV module.
In small devices (e.g. calculators, parking meters) only [[direct current]] (DC) is consumed. In larger systems (e.g. buildings, remote water pumps) AC is usually required. To convert the DC from the modules or batteries into AC, an [[Inverter (electrical)|inverter]] is used.

In [[agriculture|agricultural]] settings, the array may be used to directly power DC [[pump]]s, without the need for an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]]. In remote settings such as mountainous areas, islands, or other places where a power grid is unavailable, solar arrays can be used as the sole source of electricity, usually by charging a [[storage battery]]. Stand-alone systems closely relate to [[microgeneration]] and [[distributed generation]].

*'''Pico PV systems'''

:The smallest, often portable photovoltaic systems are called pico solar PV systems, or pico solar. They mostly combine a rechargeable battery and charge controller, with a very small PV panel. The panel's nominal capacity is just a few watt-peak (1–10 W&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) and its area less than {{ convert|0.1|m2|ft2|sigfig=1}} in size. A large range of different applications can be solar powered such as music players, fans, portable lamps, security lights, solar lighting kits, solar lanterns and street light ''(see below)'', phone chargers, radios, or even small, seven-inch LCD televisions, that run on less than ten watts. As it is the case for power generation from [[pico hydro]], pico PV systems are useful in small, rural communities that require only a small amount of electricity. Since the efficiency of many appliances have improved considerably, in particular due to the usage of [[LED lights]] and efficient rechargeable batteries, pico solar has become an affordable alternative, especially in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iea-pvps.org/fileadmin/dam/public/report/technical/rep9_12_PVPS_Pico_Solar_PV_Systems_apr13.pdf |title=Pico Solar PV Systems for Remote Homes – A new generation of small PV systems for lighting and communication |publisher=IEA-PVPS |date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metric prefix ''[[pico-]]'' stands for a ''trillionth'' to indicate the smallness of the system's electric power.

* '''Solar street lights'''

:[[Solar street light]]s raised light sources which are powered by photovoltaic panels generally mounted on the lighting structure. The solar array of such off-grid PV system charges a [[rechargeable battery]], which powers a fluorescent or LED lamp during the night. Solar street lights are stand-alone power systems, and have the advantage of savings on trenching, landscaping, and maintenance costs, as well as on the electric bills, despite their higher initial cost compared to conventional street lighting. They are designed with sufficiently large batteries to ensure operation for at least a week and even in the worst situation, they are expected to dim only slightly.

* '''Telecommunication and signaling'''

:Solar PV power is ideally suited for telecommunication applications such as local telephone exchange, radio and TV broadcasting, microwave and other forms of electronic communication links. In most telecommunication application, storage batteries are already in use and the electrical system is basically DC. In hilly and mountainous terrain, radio and TV signals may not reach as they get blocked or reflected back due to undulating terrain. At these locations, [[Low-power broadcasting|low power transmitters]] are installed to receive and retransmit the signal for local population.&lt;ref&gt;B.H Khan, 'Non-Conventional Energy Resources', TMH Publications 01-01-2006&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Solar vehicles'''

:[[Solar vehicle]], whether ground, water, air or space vehicles may obtain some or all of the energy required for their operation from the sun. Surface vehicles generally require higher power levels than can be sustained by a practically sized solar array, so a battery assists in meeting peak power demand, and the solar array recharges it. Space vehicles have successfully used solar photovoltaic systems for years of operation, eliminating the weight of fuel or primary batteries.

* '''Solar pumps'''

:One of the most cost effective solar applications is a solar powered pump, as it is far cheaper to purchase a solar panel than it is to run power lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daily.bhaskar.com/article/RAJ-JPR-pay-bill-for-4-months-get-power-for-25-years-3491363.html 'Pay bill for 4 months, get power for 25 years']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pumping Water with Sunshine|url=http://www.homepower.com/articles/solar-electricity/equipment-products/pumping-water-sunshine|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar Well Pumps|url=https://www.sunrotor.com/|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often meet a need for water beyond the reach of power lines, taking the place of a [[windmill]] or [[windpump]]. One common application is the filling of livestock watering tanks, so that grazing cattle may drink. Another is the refilling of drinking water storage tanks on remote or self-sufficient homes.

* '''Spacecraft'''

:[[Solar panels on spacecraft]] have been one of the first applications of photovoltaics since the launch of [[Vanguard 1]] in 1958, the first satellite to use solar cells. Contrary to [[Sputnik]], the first artificial satellite to orbit the planet, that ran out of batteries within 21 days due to the lack of solar-power, most modern [[communications satellite]]s and [[space probe]]s in the [[inner solar system]] rely on the use of solar panels to derive electricity from sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/articles/space-based-solar-power |title=Space-Based Solar Power |website=energy.gov |date=6 March 2014 |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exploringgreentechnology.com/solar-energy/history-of-solar-energy/ |title=History of Solar Energy |website=exploringgreentechnology.com |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Do it yourself community'''

:With agrowing interest in environmentally friendly green energy, hobbyists in the [[Do it yourself|DIY]]-community have endeavored to build their own solar PV systems from kits&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenplanet4energy.com People building their own solar systems from kits].

These systems usually generate power amount of ~2&amp;nbsp;kW or less. Through the internet, the community is now able to obtain plans to (partly) construct the system and there is a growing trend toward building them for domestic requirements.

Although they are reduced in energy conversion efficiency from single crystalline "siwafers", they are also much easier to produce at comparably lower costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quantumsp.com/en/solar-energy/a-comparison-of-pv-technologies/ A Comparison of PV Technologies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709163216/http://quantumsp.com/en/solar-energy/a-comparison-of-pv-technologies/ |date=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The table below shows the total (average) cost in US cents per kWh of electricity generated by a photovoltaic system.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{I\cdot (1+i)+\sum_{t=0}^T \frac{I \cdot b}{(1+i)^t}}{\sum_{t=0}^T\frac{E\cdot (1-v)^t}{(1+i)^t}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solar-estimate.org/showfaq.php?id=261 What is Levelized Cost?]&lt;/ref&gt; The row headings on the left show the total cost, per peak kilowatt (kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;), of a photovoltaic installation. Photovoltaic system costs have been declining and in Germany, for example, were reported to have fallen to USD 1389/kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; by the end of 2014.&lt;ref name="pvgde:priceindex"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.photovoltaik-guide.de/pv-preisindex |title=PV price index Germany |access-date=2014-08-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710020014/http://www.photovoltaik-guide.de/pv-preisindex |archive-date=2017-07-10 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; The column headings across the top refer to the annual energy output in kWh expected from each installed kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. This varies by geographic region because the average [[insolation]] depends on the average cloudiness and the thickness of atmosphere traversed by the sunlight. It also depends on the path of the sun relative to the panel and the horizon. 
Panels are usually mounted at an angle based on latitude, and often they are adjusted seasonally to meet the changing solar [[declination]]. [[Solar tracking]] can also be utilized to access even more perpendicular sunlight, thereby raising the total energy output.

The calculated values in the table reflect the total (average) cost in cents per kWh produced. They assume a 10% total capital cost (for instance 4% [[interest rate]], 1% operating and maintenance cost,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/pdfs/46025.pdf PV operation and maintenance costs].

=== Learning curve ===
Photovoltaic systems demonstrate a learning curve in terms of [[levelized cost of electricity]] (LCOE), reducing its cost per kWh by 32.6% for every doubling of capacity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://inspecro.com/blog/learning-curve-analysis-solar-pv-to-be-the-cheapest-renewables-in-2024/|title=Learning Curve Analysis: Solar PV to be the Cheapest Renewables in 2024 - Inspecro Blog|date=2018-05-05|work=Inspecro Blog|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2018/Jan/IRENA_2017_Power_Costs_2018.pdf|title=Renewable Power Generation Costs 2017|website=International Renewable Energy Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2018/Mar/IRENA_RE_Capacity_Statistics_2018.pdf|title=Renewable Capacity Statistics 2018|website=International Renewable Energy Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the data of LCOE and cumulative installed capacity from [[International Renewable Energy Agency|International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA)]] from 2010 to 2017,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  the learning curve equation for photovoltaic systems is given as&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Standardization ===

Increasing use of photovoltaic systems and integration of photovoltaic power into existing structures and techniques of supply and distribution increases the need for general standards and definitions for photovoltaic components and systems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The standards are compiled at the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) and apply to efficiency, durability and safety of cells, modules, simulation programs, plug connectors and cables, mounting systems, overall efficiency of inverters etc.&lt;ref&gt;Regan Arndt and Dr. Ing Robert Puto. Basic Understanding of IEC Standard Testing For Photovoltaic Panels. Available: http://tuvamerica.com/services/photovoltaics/ArticleBasicUnderstandingPV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National regulations ===

;United Kingdom

In the UK, PV installations are generally considered permitted development and don't require planning permission. If the property is listed or in a designated area (National Park, Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Site of Special Scientific Interest or Norfolk Broads) then planning permission is required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/permission/commonprojects/solarpanels/ Solar Panels]. Planning Portal. Retrieved on 2013-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

;United States

In the United States, article 690 of the National Electric Code provides general guidelines for the installation of photovoltaic systems; these may be superseded by local laws and regulations. Often a permit is required necessitating plan submissions and structural calculations before work may begin. Additionally, many locales require the work to be performed under the guidance of a licensed electrician.

In the [[United States]], the [[Authority Having Jurisdiction]] (AHJ) will review designs and issue permits, before construction can lawfully begin. Electrical installation practices must comply with standards set forth within the [[National Electrical Code]] (NEC) and be inspected by the AHJ to ensure compliance with [[building code]], [[electrical code]], and [[fire safety]] code. Jurisdictions may require that equipment has been tested, certified, listed, and labeled by at least one of the [[Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratories]] (NRTL).  .&lt;ref name="Solar Power World"&gt;[http://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/top-250-solar-contractors/ Solar Power World]&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, many localities require a permit to install a photovoltaic system. A grid-tied system normally requires a licensed electrician to connect between the system and the grid-connected wiring of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bootsontheroof.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=32:requirements-for-solar-installation-a-incentives-by-state&amp;catid=14&amp;Itemid=65 |title=Requirements for Solar Installations |work=bootsontheroof.com |year=2011 |accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Installers who meet these qualifications are located in almost every state.&lt;ref name="Solar Power World" /&gt; Several states prohibit [[homeowners' association]]s from restricting solar devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=CA45R&amp;re=1&amp;ee=1|title=California Solar Rights Act|accessdate=February 25, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019231500/http://www.dsireusa.org/solar/incentives/incentive.cfm?Incentive_Code=CA45R&amp;re=1&amp;ee=1|archivedate=October 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2018/08/solar-hoa/|title=Solar does work within HOAs, but installers have to stay vigilant|date=2018-08-13|website=Solar Power World|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hopb.co/blog/the-ins-and-outs-of-solar-panels-in-hoa-communities|title=The Ins and Outs of Solar Panels In HOA Communities|website=Homeowners Protection Bureau, LLC|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Spain

Although [[Renewable energy in Spain|Spain generates around 40%]] of its electricity via photovoltaic and other renewable energy sources, and cities such as Huelva and Seville boast nearly 3,000 hours of sunshine per year, in 2013 Spain issued a solar tax to account for the debt created by the investment done by the Spanish government. Those who do not connect to the grid can face up to a fine of 30 million euros ($40 million USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hunt |first=Tam |title=Spain and Portugal Lead the Way on Renewable Energy Transformation |date=7 February 2011 |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2011/02/spain-and-portugal-lead-the-way-on-renewable-energy-transformation|publisher=Renewable Energy World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Phillips Erb|first=Kelly|title=Out Of Ideas And In Debt, Spain Sets Sights On Taxing The Sun|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2013/08/19/out-of-ideas-and-in-debt-spain-sets-sights-on-taxing-the-sun/ |accessdate=20 November 2014 |newspaper=Forbes |date=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such measures were finally withdrawn by 2018, when new legislation was introduced banning any taxes on renewable energy self-consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jiménez |first1=Javiier |title=Así queda la regulación del autoconsumo en España tras la eliminación del "impuesto al sol" |url=https://www.xataka.com/energia/asi-queda-autoconsumo-espana-eliminacion-impuesto-al-sol |website=Xataka |accessdate=28 April 2020 |ref=xataka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations==

=== Pollution and Energy in PV Production===
PV has been a well-known method of generating clean, emission free electricity. PV systems are often made of PV modules and inverter (changing DC to AC). PV modules are mainly made of PV cells, which has no fundamental difference to the material for making computer chips. The process of producing PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals. There are few PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV. This measure greatly reduces the carbon footprint during the manufacturing process. Managing the chemicals used in the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations.

=== Impact on Electricity Network ===
With the increasing levels of rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes 2-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid. However, electricity network traditionally is not designed to deal with the 2- way energy transfer. Therefore, some technical issues may occur. For example, in Queensland Australia, there have been more than 30% of households with rooftop PV by the end of 2017. The famous Californian 2020 [[duck curve]] appears very often for a lot of communities from 2015 onwards. An over-voltage issue may come out as the electricity flows  back to the network.&lt;ref&gt;W. Miller, A. L. Liu, Z. Amin, and A. Wagner, "Power quality and rooftop-PV households: an examination of measured data at point of customer connection," Sustainability,  http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/4/1224 (Open Access), p. 29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; There are solutions to manage the over voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at electricity distributor level, re-conductor the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.

=== Implication onto Electricity Bill Management and Energy Investment ===
Customers have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. An electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charge when electricity price is reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economic decision and  investment decisions are based on systematical evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Solutions for reducing facility electricity costs | website=Australian Ageing Agenda | author=L.
