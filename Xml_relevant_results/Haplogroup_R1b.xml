'''Haplogroup R1b''' ('''R-M343'''), also known as '''Hg1''' and '''Eu18''', is a [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup|human Y-chromosome haplogroup]].

It is the most frequently occurring paternal lineage in [[Western Europe]], as well as some parts of [[Russia]] (e.g. the [[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] minority) and [[Central Africa]] (e.g. [[Chad]] and [[Cameroon]]). The clade is also present at lower frequencies throughout [[Eastern Europe]], [[Western Asia]], as well as parts of [[North Africa]] and [[Central Asia]].

R1b has two primary branches: R1b1a-L754 and R1b1b-PH155. R1b1a1a2-M269, which predominates in Western Europe, and R1b1a2-V88, which is common in Central Africa, are both subclades of R1b-L754. R1b1b-PH155 is so rare and widely dispersed that it is difficult to draw any conclusions about its origins. It has been found in [[Bahrain]], [[Bhutan]], [[Ladakh]], [[Tajikistan]], Turkey, and Western China.

According to ancient DNA studies, [[R1a]] and the majority of R1b would have expanded from the [[Caspian Sea]] along with the [[Indo-European languages]].&lt;ref name="biorxiv.org"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haak W, Lazaridis I, Patterson N, Rohland N, Mallick S, Llamas B, Brandt G, Nordenfelt S, Harney E, Stewardson K, Fu Q, Mittnik A, Bánffy E, Economou C, Francken M, Friederich S, Pena RG, Hallgren F, Khartanovich V, Khokhlov A, Kunst M, Kuznetsov P, Meller H, Mochalov O, Moiseyev V, Nicklisch N, Pichler SL, Risch R, Rojo Guerra MA, Roth C, Szécsényi-Nagy A, Wahl J, Meyer M, Krause J, Brown D, Anthony D, Cooper A, Alt KW, Reich D | display-authors = 6 | title = Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe | journal = Nature | volume = 522 | issue = 7555 | pages = 207–11 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25731166 | pmc = 5048219 | doi = 10.1101/013433 | arxiv = 1502.02783 | bibcode = 2015Natur.522..207H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allentoft ME, Sikora M, Sjögren KG, Rasmussen S, Rasmussen M, Stenderup J, Damgaard PB, Schroeder H, Ahlström T, Vinner L, Malaspinas AS, Margaryan A, Higham T, Chivall D, Lynnerup N, Harvig L, Baron J, Della Casa P, Dąbrowski P, Duffy PR, Ebel AV, Epimakhov A, Frei K, Furmanek M, Gralak T, Gromov A, Gronkiewicz S, Grupe G, Hajdu T, Jarysz R, Khartanovich V, Khokhlov A, Kiss V, Kolář J, Kriiska A, Lasak I, Longhi C, McGlynn G, Merkevicius A, Merkyte I, Metspalu M, Mkrtchyan R, Moiseyev V, Paja L, Pálfi G, Pokutta D, Pospieszny Ł, Price TD, Saag L, Sablin M, Shishlina N, Smrčka V, Soenov VI, Szeverényi V, Tóth G, Trifanova SV, Varul L, Vicze M, Yepiskoposyan L, Zhitenev V, Orlando L, Sicheritz-Pontén T, Brunak S, Nielsen R, Kristiansen K, Willerslev E | display-authors = 6 | title = Population genomics of Bronze Age Eurasia | journal = Nature | volume = 522 | issue = 7555 | pages = 167–72 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26062507 | doi = 10.1038/nature14507 | url = https://depot.ceon.pl/handle/123456789/13155 | bibcode = 2015Natur.522..167A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1101/016477|title = Eight thousand years of natural selection in Europe|journal = bioRxiv|pages = 016477|year = 2015| vauthors = Mathieson I, Lazaridis I, Rohland N, Mallick S, Patterson N, Roodenberg SA, etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cassidy LM, Martiniano R, Murphy EM, Teasdale MD, Mallory J, Hartwell B, Bradley DG | title = Neolithic and Bronze Age migration to Ireland and establishment of the insular Atlantic genome | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 113 | issue = 2 | pages = 368–73 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26712024 | pmc = 4720318 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1518445113 | bibcode = 2016PNAS..113..368C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martiniano R, Cassidy LM, Ó'Maoldúin R, McLaughlin R, Silva NM, Manco L, Fidalgo D, Pereira T, Coelho MJ, Serra M, Burger J, Parreira R, Moran E, Valera AC, Porfirio E, Boaventura R, Silva AM, Bradley DG | display-authors = 6 | title = The population genomics of archaeological transition in west Iberia: Investigation of ancient substructure using imputation and haplotype-based methods | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 13 | issue = 7 | pages = e1006852 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28749934 | pmc = 5531429 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1006852 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three genetic studies in 2015 gave support to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] of [[Marija Gimbutas]] regarding the [[Proto-Indo-European homeland]]. According to those studies, haplogroups R1b-M269 and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia) would have expanded from the West Eurasian Steppe, along with the [[Indo-European languages]]; they also detected an [[autosome|autosomal]] component present in modern Europeans which was not present in [[Neolithic Europe]]ans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo-European languages.&lt;ref name="biorxiv.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

(2018) propose that R1b-V88 originated in Europe about 12 000 years ago and crossed to North Africa by about 8000 years ago; it may formerly have been common in southern Europe, where it has since been replaced by waves of other haplogroups, leaving remnant subclades almost excusively in [[Sardinia]]. It first radiated within Africa likely between 7 and 8 000 years ago – at the same time as trans-Saharan expansions within the unrelated haplogroups E-M2 and A-M13 – possibly due to population growth allowed by humid conditions and the adoption of livestock herding in the Sahara. R1b-V1589, the main subclade within R1b-V88, underwent a further expansion around 5500 years ago, likely in the Lake Chad Basin region, from which some lines recrossed the Sahara to North Africa.&lt;ref name=D'Atanasio2018&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Atanasio E, Trombetta B, Bonito M, Finocchio A, Di Vito G, Seghizzi M, Romano R, Russo G, Paganotti GM, Watson E, Coppa A, Anagnostou P, Dugoujon JM, Moral P, Sellitto D, Novelletto A, Cruciani F | display-authors = 6 | title = The peopling of the last Green Sahara revealed by high-coverage resequencing of trans-Saharan patrilineages | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 20 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 29433568 | pmc = 5809971 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-018-1393-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA sequencing of ancient individuals provides strong evidence for this proposed model of North to South trans-saharan movement: The earliest basal R1b-V88 haplogroups are found in several Eastern European Hunter Gatherers close to 10 000 years ago. The haplogroup then seemingly further spread with the Neolithic [[Cardial Ware]] expansion, which established agriculture in the Western Mediterranean around 7500 BP: R1b-V88 haplogroups were identified in ancient Neolithic individuals in central Italy, Iberia and, at a particularly high frequency, in Sardinia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14523-6?|title=Genetic history from the Middle Neolithic to present on the Mediterranean island of Sardinia|journal=Nature|year=2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; A part of the branch leading to present-day African haplogroups (V2197) is already derived in some of these ancient Neolithic European individuals, providing further support for a North to South trans-saharan movement.

===External phylogeny of R1b===
{{main|Haplogroup P-P295|Structure of Y-DNA Haplogroup K}}

The broader haplogroup [[Haplogroup R (Y-DNA)|R]] (M207) is a primary subclade of haplogroup [[Haplogroup P-M45|P1]] (M45) itself a primary branch of [[Haplogroup P (Y-DNA)|P]] (P295), which is also known as haplogroup K2b2. R-M207 is therefore a secondary branch of  [[Haplogroup K2b (Y-DNA)|K2b]] (P331), and a direct descendant of [[Haplogroup K2|K2]] (M526).

There was "an initial rapid diversification" of [[Haplogroup K2|K-M526]], according to Karafet et al. (2014), which "likely occurred in [[Southeast Asia]], with subsequent westward expansions of the ancestors of haplogroups R and [[Haplogroup Q-M242|Q]]".

=== Internal structure of R1b ===
Names such as R1b, R1b1 and so on are [[phylogenetic]] (i.e. "family tree") names which make clear their place within the branching of haplogroups, or the phylogenetic tree. An alternative way of naming the same haplogroups and subclades refers to their defining [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] mutations: for example, R-M343 is equivalent to R1b.&lt;ref name=Cinnio04/&gt; Phylogenetic [[Conversion table for Y chromosome haplogroups|names change with new discoveries]] and SNP-based names are consequently reclassified within the phylogenetic tree. In some cases, an SNP is found to be unreliable as a defining mutation and an SNP-based name is removed completely. For example, before 2005, R1b was synonymous with R-P25, which was later reclassified as R1b1; in 2016, R-P25 was removed completely as a defining SNP, due to a significant rate of back-mutation.&lt;ref name="isogg2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://isogg.org/tree/2016/ISOGG_HapgrpR16.html|title=ISOGG 2016 Y-DNA Haplogroup R|website=isogg.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Below is the basic outline of R1b according to the ISOGG Tree as it stood on January 30, 2017.&lt;ref name=isogg/&gt;)

==Geographical distribution==

=== R1b* (R-M343*) ===
No confirmed cases of R1b* (R-M343*) – that is R1b1(xR1b1), also known as R-M343(xL278) – have been reported in [[peer-reviewed]] literature.

Likewise no known examples of R1b1*, also known as R-L278* and R-L278(xL754,PH155), have been found.

;R-M343(xM73,M269,V88)
In early research, because R-M269, R-M73 and R-V88 are by far the most common forms of R1b, examples of R1b(xM73,xM269) were sometimes assumed to signify basal examples of "R1b*".&lt;ref name="isogg2016"/&gt; However, while the paragroup R-M343(xM73,M269,V88) is rare, it does not preclude membership of rare and/or subsequently-discovered, relatively basal subclades of R1b, such as R-L278* (R1b1*), R-L389* (R1b1a1*), R-P297* (R1b1a1a*), R-V1636 (R1b1a1b) or R-PH155 (R1b1b).

The population believed to have the highest proportion of R-M343(xM73,M269,V88) are the [[Kurds]] of southeastern [[Kazakhstan]] with 13%.&lt;ref name="Myres2011" /&gt; However, more recently, a large study of Y-chromosome variation in [[Iran]], revealed R-M343(xV88,M73,M269) as high as 4.3% among Iranian sub-populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grugni V, Battaglia V, Hooshiar Kashani B, Parolo S, Al-Zahery N, Achilli A, Olivieri A, Gandini F, Houshmand M, Sanati MH, Torroni A, Semino O | display-authors = 6 | title = Ancient migratory events in the Middle East: new clues from the Y-chromosome variation of modern Iranians | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = e41252 | date = July 18, 2012 | pmid = 22815981 | pmc = 3399854 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0041252 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...741252G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

R1b subclades have also been found in [[Han Chinese]] from Shandong, Heilongjiang and Gansu provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lkhagvasuren G, Shin H, Lee SE, Tumen D, Kim JH, Kim KY, Kim K, Park AJ, Lee HW, Kim MJ, Choi J, Choi JH, Min NY, Lee KH | display-authors = 6 | title = Molecular Genealogy of a Mongol Queen's Family and Her Possible Kinship with Genghis Khan | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | pages = e0161622 | date = September 14, 2016 | pmid = 27627454 | pmc = 5023095 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0161622 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1161622L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It remains a possibility that some, or even most of these cases, may be R-L278* (R1b1*), R-L389* (R1b1a1*), R-P297* (R1b1a1a*), R-V1636 (R1b1a1b), R-PH155 (R1b1b), R1b* (R-M343*), R1a* (R-M420*), an otherwise undocumented branch of R1 (R-M173), and/or back-mutations of a marker, from a positive to a negative ancestral state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams SM, King TE, Bosch E, Jobling MA | title = The case of the unreliable SNP: recurrent back-mutation of Y-chromosomal marker P25 through gene conversion | journal = Forensic Science International | volume = 159 | issue = 1 | pages = 14–20 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16026953 | doi = 10.1016/j.forsciint.2005.06.003 | hdl = 2381/443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence constitute undocumented subclades of R1b.

A compilation of previous studies regarding the distribution of R1b can be found in Cruciani et al. (2010).&lt;ref name=Cruciani2010/&gt; It is summarised in the table following. (Cruciani did not include some studies suggesting even higher frequencies of R1b1a1a2 [R-M269] in some parts of Western Europe.)

=== R1b1 (R-L278) ===
R-L278 among modern men falls into the R-L754 and R-PH155 subclades, though it is possible some very rare R-L278* may exist as not all examples have been tested for both branches. Examples may also exist in ancient DNA, though due to poor quality it is often impossible to tell whether or not the ancients carried the mutations that define subclades.

Some examples described in older articles, for example two found in Turkey,&lt;ref name=Cinnio04&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cinnioğlu C, King R, Kivisild T, Kalfoğlu E, Atasoy S, Cavalleri GL, Lillie AS, Roseman CC, Lin AA, Prince K, Oefner PJ, Shen P, Semino O, Cavalli-Sforza LL, Underhill PA | display-authors = 6 | title = Excavating Y-chromosome haplotype strata in Anatolia | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 114 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–48 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14586639 | doi = 10.1007/s00439-003-1031-4 | url = http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/HG_2004_v114_p127-148.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060619105314/http://hpgl.stanford.edu/publications/HG_2004_v114_p127-148.pdf  |  archive-date = 2006-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are now thought to be mostly in the more recently discovered sub-clade R1b1a2 (R-V88). Most examples of R1b therefore fall into subclades R1b1a2 (R-V88) or R1b1a (R-P297).

{{anchor|R1b1}}

=== R1b1a (R-L754) ===
&lt;!-- formerly "P297", but this is now R1b1a1a. In the 2017 tree, R1b1a is identified by:
L754/PF6269/YSC0000022, A702, CTS3063/V2515, CTS3794/PF6256/S4229, CTS4244/PF6257/YSC0001279, CTS4764/PF6041, CTS7585, CTS8436/PF6259, CTS8612/PF6260, CTS9972/PF6261, FGC35, FGC36/Y409, FGC41/M12190/Y108, L761/PF6258/YSC0000266, L820/PF6262/YSC0000211, L1068/PF6264/YSC0000223, L1345/PF6266/YSC0000224, PF6249, PF6263, PF6271--&gt;

R-L754 contains the vast majority of R1b. The only known example of R-L754*(xL389,V88) is also the earliest known individual to carry R1b: "[[Villabruna 1]]", who lived circa 14,000 years BP (north east Italy). Villabruna 1 belonged to the [[Epigravettian]] culture.

=== R1b1a1 (R-L389) ===
{{anchor|R1b1a1}}R-L389, also known as R1b1a1 (L388/PF6468, L389/PF6531), contains the very common subclade R-P297 and the rare subclade R-V1636. It is unknown whether all previously reported R-L389*(xP297) belong to R-V1636 or not.

=== R1b1a1a (R-P297) ===
The SNP marker P297 was recognised in 2008 as ancestral to the significant subclades M73 and M269, combining them into one cluster.&lt;ref name=Karafet08/&gt; This had been given the phylogenetic name R1b1a1a (and, previously, R1b1a).

A majority of Eurasian R1b falls within this subclade, representing a very large modern population. Although P297 itself has not yet been much tested for, the same population has been relatively well studied in terms of other markers. Therefore, the branching within this clade can be explained in relatively high detail below.

Dulik ''et al.'' (2012) found R-M73 in 35.3% (6/17) of a sample of the [[Kumandin]] of the Altai Republic in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dulik MC, Zhadanov SI, Osipova LP, Askapuli A, Gau L, Gokcumen O, Rubinstein S, Schurr TG | display-authors = 6 | title = Mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome variation provides evidence for a recent common ancestry between Native Americans and Indigenous Altaians | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 90 | issue = 2 | pages = 229–46 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22281367 | pmc = 3276666 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.12.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of these six Kumandins share an identical 15-loci Y-STR haplotype, and another two differ only at the DYS458 locus, having DYS458=18 instead of DYS458=17. This pair of Kumandin R-M73 haplotypes resembles the haplotypes of two Kalmyks, two Tuvinians, and one Altaian whose Y-DNA has been analyzed by Malyarchuk ''et al.'' (2011). The remaining R-M73 Kumandin has a Y-STR haplotype that is starkly different from the haplotypes of the other R-M73 Kumandins, resembling instead the haplotypes of five Shors, five Teleuts, and two Khakassians.&lt;ref name="Malyarchuk2011" /&gt;

While early research into R-M73 claimed that it was significantly represented among the [[Hazaras|Hazara]] of Afghanistan and the [[Bashkirs]] of the Ural Mountains, this has apparently been overturned. For example, supporting material from a 2010 study by Behar ''et al.'' suggested that Sengupta ''et al.'' (2006) might have misidentified Hazara individuals, who instead belonged to "PQR2" as opposed to "R(xR1a)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Behar DM, Yunusbayev B, Metspalu M, Metspalu E, Rosset S, Parik J, Rootsi S, Chaubey G, Kutuev I, Yudkovsky G, Khusnutdinova EK, Balanovsky O, Semino O, Pereira L, Comas D, Gurwitz D, Bonne-Tamir B, Parfitt T, Hammer MF, Skorecki K, Villems R | display-authors = 6 | title = The genome-wide structure of the Jewish people | journal = Nature | volume = 466 | issue = 7303 | pages = 238–42 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20531471 | doi = 10.1038/nature09103 | url = https://media.nature.com/full/nature-assets/nature/journal/v466/n7303/extref/nature09103-s1.pdf | bibcode = 2010Natur.466..238B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myres2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sengupta S, Zhivotovsky LA, King R, Mehdi SQ, Edmonds CA, Chow CE, Lin AA, Mitra M, Sil SK, Ramesh A, Usha Rani MV, Thakur CM, Cavalli-Sforza LL, Majumder PP, Underhill PA | display-authors = 6 | title = Polarity and temporality of high-resolution y-chromosome distributions in India identify both indigenous and exogenous expansions and reveal minor genetic influence of Central Asian pastoralists | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 202–21 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16400607 | pmc = 1380230 | doi = 10.1086/499411 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the assignment of these Hazaras' Y-DNA to the "PQR2" category by Behar ''et al.''

R-M269 has received significant  scientific and popular interest due to its possible connection to the [[Indo-European expansion]] in Europe. Specifically the R-L23 (R-Z2103) subclade has been found to be prevalent in ancient DNA associated with the [[Yamna culture#Genetics|Yamna culture]].&lt;ref name=haak2015&gt;{{cite biorxiv |last=Haak |first=Wolfgang |last2=Lazaridis |first2=Iosif | name-list-format = vanc |date=February 10, 2015 |title=Massive migration from the steppe is a source for Indo-European languages in Europe |biorxiv=10.1101/013433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven individuals were determined to belong to the R1b-M269 subclade.&lt;ref name="biorxiv.org"/&gt;

Likewise, the oldest samples classified as belonging to R-M269, have been found in Eastern Europe and Pontic-Caspian steppe, not Western Asia. Western European populations are  divided between the R-P312/S116 and R-U106/S21 subclades of  R-M412 (R-L51).

Distribution of R-M269 in Europe increases in frequency from east to west. It peaks at the national level in [[Wales]] at a rate of 92%, at 82% in [[Ireland]], 70% in [[Scotland]], 68% in [[Spain]], 60% in [[France]] (76% in [[Normandy]]), about 60% in [[Portugal]],&lt;ref name="Myres2011" /&gt; 45% in Eastern [[England]], 50% in [[Germany]], 50% in the [[Netherlands]], 42% in [[Iceland]], and 43% in [[Denmark]], 39% in [[Italy]].
R-M269 reaches levels as high as 95% in parts of Ireland. It has also been found at lower frequencies throughout central [[Eurasia]],&lt;ref name = "Underhill2000" /&gt; but with relatively high frequency among the [[Bashkirs]] of the [[Perm]] region (84.0%).&lt;ref name="ftp.anrb.ru"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=http://ftp.anrb.ru/molgen/Lobov_AS.PDF | vauthors = Lobov AS | degree = Ph.D. |date=2009 |title=Structure of the Gene Pool of Bashkir Subpopulations |language=Russian |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816193639/http://ftp.anrb.ru/molgen/Lobov_AS.PDF |archive-date=2011-08-16 | publisher = Institute of Biochemistry and Genetics of the Ufa Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt; This marker is present in China and India at frequencies of less than one percent.

=== R1b1a2 (R-V88) ===

R1b1a2 (PF6279/V88; previously R1b1c) is defined by the presence of SNP marker V88, the discovery of which was announced in 2010 by Cruciani et al.&lt;ref name="Cruciani2010"/&gt; Apart from individuals in southern Europe and Western Asia, the majority of R-V88 was found in the Sahel, especially among populations speaking [[Afroasiatic languages]] of the [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] branch.

Studies in 2005–08 reported "R1b*" at high levels in [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]. However, subsequent research indicates that the samples concerned most likely belong to the subclade R-V88, which is now concentrated in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], following migration from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Flores et. al. (2005) found that 20 out of all 146 men tested (13.7%) – including 20 out of 45 men tested from the [[Dead Sea]] area of Jordan – were positive for M173 (R1), and negative for both the R1a markers SRY10831.2 and M17, as well as P25 (which was later discovered to be an unreliable marker for R1b1), a study [https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2010146] indicates that they are mostly R-V88 (later known as R1b1a2). Wood et al. (2005) also reported two Egyptian cases of R1* (R-M173*) that were negative for SRY10831 (R1a1) and the unreliable R1b1 marker P25, out of a sample of 1,122 males from African countries, including 92 from Egypt. Hassan et al. (2008) found an equally surprising 14 out of 26 (54%) of Sudanese [[Fula people]] who were M173+ and P25-&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myres2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=flores2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Flores C, Maca-Meyer N, Larruga JM, Cabrera VM, Karadsheh N, Gonzalez AM | title = Isolates in a corridor of migrations: a high-resolution analysis of Y-chromosome variation in Jordan | journal = Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 50 | issue = 9 | pages = 435–441 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16142507 | doi = 10.1007/s10038-005-0274-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18618658&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hassan HY, Underhill PA, Cavalli-Sforza LL, Ibrahim ME | title = Y-chromosome variation among Sudanese: restricted gene flow, concordance with language, geography, and history | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 137 | issue = 3 | pages = 316–23 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18618658 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.20876 | url = http://dirkschweitzer.net/E3b-papers/Hassan-Sudan-2008-AJPA.pdf | url-status = dead | quote = 13/32 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090304100010/http://dirkschweitzer.net/E3b-papers/Hassan-Sudan-2008-AJPA.pdf | archive-date = 2009-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wood2005/&gt;

Two branches of R-V88, R-M18 and R-V35, are found almost exclusively on the island of [[Sardinia]].

As can be seen in the above data table, R-V88 is found in northern [[Cameroon]] in west central Africa at a very high frequency, where it is considered to be caused by a pre-Islamic movement of people from [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref name=Wood2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wood ET, Stover DA, Ehret C, Destro-Bisol G, Spedini G, McLeod H, Louie L, Bamshad M, Strassmann BI, Soodyall H, Hammer MF | display-authors = 6 | title = Contrasting patterns of Y chromosome and mtDNA variation in Africa: evidence for sex-biased demographic processes | journal = European Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 13 | issue = 7 | pages = 867–76 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15856073 | doi = 10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201408 | url = http://hammerlab.biosci.arizona.edu/publications/Wood_2005_EUR.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626010918/http://hammerlab.biosci.arizona.edu/publications/Wood_2005_EUR.pdf  |  archive-date = June 26, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cruciani F, Santolamazza P, Shen P, Macaulay V, Moral P, Olckers A, Modiano D, Holmes S, Destro-Bisol G, Coia V, Wallace DC, Oefner PJ, Torroni A, Cavalli-Sforza LL, Scozzari R, Underhill PA | display-authors = 6 | title = A back migration from Asia to sub-Saharan Africa is supported by high-resolution analysis of human Y-chromosome haplotypes | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 70 | issue = 5 | pages = 1197–214 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 11910562 | pmc = 447595 | doi = 10.1086/340257 }}, pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Gonzalez et al. (2013) found that patterns of diversity in African R1b-V88 did not fit with a movement of Chadic-speaking people from the North across the Sahara to West-Central Africa, but was compatible with the reverse, an origin of the V88 lineages in Central-West Africa, followed by migration to North Africa.&lt;ref name="Gonzalez2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = González M, Gomes V, López-Parra AM, Amorim A, Carracedo A, Sánchez-Diz P, Arroyo-Pardo E, Gusmão L | display-authors = 6 | title = The genetic landscape of Equatorial Guinea and the origin and migration routes of the Y chromosome haplogroup R-V88 | journal = European Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 21 | issue = 3 | pages = 324–31 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 22892526 | pmc = 3573200 | doi = 10.1038/ejhg.2012.167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== R1b1a2a (R-M18) ===
R1b1a2a is a sub-clade of R-V88, which is defined by the presence of SNP marker M18.&lt;ref name=Karafet08&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karafet TM, Mendez FL, Meilerman MB, Underhill PA, Zegura SL, Hammer MF | title = New binary polymorphisms reshape and increase resolution of the human Y chromosomal haplogroup tree | journal = Genome Research | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 830–8 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18385274 | pmc = 2336805 | doi = 10.1101/gr.7172008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== R1b1b (R-PH155) ===
The other primary branch of R1b1 is R-PH155 (R1b1b), which is extremely rare and defined by the presence of PH155.&lt;ref name="isogg"/&gt; Living males carrying subclades of R-PH155 have been found in [[Bahrain]], [[Bhutan]], [[Ladakh]], [[Tajikistan]], Turkey, [[Xinjiang]], and [[Yunnan]]. [[ISOGG]] (2017) cites two primary branches: R-M335 (R1b1b1) and  R-PH200 (R1b1b2).

The defining SNP of R1b1b1, M335, was first documented in 2004, when an example was discovered in Turkey, though it was classified at that time as R1b4.&lt;ref name=Cinnio04/&gt; Other examples of R-M335 have been reported in a sample of [[Hui people|Hui]] from [[Yunnan]], China&lt;ref name = "Zhong2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhong H, Shi H, Qi XB, Duan ZY, Tan PP, Jin L, Su B, Ma RZ | display-authors = 6 | title = Extended Y chromosome investigation suggests postglacial migrations of modern humans into East Asia via the northern route | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 717–27 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20837606 | doi = 10.1093/molbev/msq247 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a sample of people from [[Ladakh]], India.&lt;ref name = "Rowold2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rowold DJ, Perez Benedico D, Garcia-Bertrand R, Chennakrishnaiah S, Alfonso-Sanchez MA, Gayden T, Herrera RJ | title = Ladakh, India: the land of high passes and genetic heterogeneity reveals a confluence of migrations | journal = European Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 442–9 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 25966630 | pmc = 4755386 | doi = 10.1038/ejhg.2015.80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In commercial testing of Y-DNA, R-M335 has been found in individuals who have reported paternal ancestry in Germany and Italy (including [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]]).&lt;ref name = "FTDNAR1bBasal"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.familytreedna.com/public/R1bBasalSubclades?iframe=yresults|title=FamilyTreeDNA - R1b Basal Subclades}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of the other subclade of R-PH155, ''i.e.'' R1b1b2-PH200, have been found in individuals from Turkey ([[Konya]] and [[Gaziantep]], with at least the latter reporting [[Armenian people|Armenian]] ethnicity), [[Bahrain]], and [[Bhutan]].&lt;ref name = "FTDNAR1bBasal" /&gt;

Other examples of R-PH155, with precise subclade unresolved, have been found in a [[Tajik people|Tajik]] in Tajikistan and in a [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] in academic studies and in an individual who has reported paternal ancestry in [[Varanasi]], India in commercial testing.&lt;ref name = "FTDNAR1bBasal" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
* [[Bryan Sykes]], in his 2006 book ''Blood of the Isles'', gives the members – and the notional founding patriarch – of R1b the name "[[Oisín]]".
* [[Stephen Oppenheimer]], in his 2007 book ''Origins of the British'', gives the R1b patriarch the [[Basque language|Basque]] name "Ruisko" in honour of what Oppenheimer believed to be the Iberian origin of R1b.
* A filmmaker named Artem Lukichev created  (circa  2009), a 14-minute animated film based on a [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]] epic from the [[Ural Mountains]], relating the epic to the emergence and  geographical expansion of R1a and R1b.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMBuo7JHesg|title=About R1a and R1b from Ural epic story. Artem Lukichev (c)|via=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* DNA tests that assisted in the identification of Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] found that he belonged to R1b.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coble MD, Loreille OM, Wadhams MJ, Edson SM, Maynard K, Meyer CE, Niederstätter H, Berger C, Berger B, Falsetti AB, Gill P, Parson W, Finelli LN | display-authors = 6 | title = Mystery solved: the identification of the two missing Romanov children using DNA analysis | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = e4838 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19277206 | pmc = 2652717 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004838 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4838C }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may suggest that the later Czars of the [[House of Romanov]], descended in the male line from the  [[Holstein-Gottorp|House of Holstein-Gottorp]] (which originated in [[Schleswig-Holstein]]) are also members of R1b.
