'''''The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)''''' is a 1988 book by "The Timelords" ([[Jimmy Cauty]] and [[Bill Drummond]]), better known as [[The KLF]]. It is a step by step guide to achieving a No.1 single with no money or musical skills, and a case study of the duo's UK [[Novelty song|novelty pop]] No. 1 "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]".

==How to have a number one==
The advice dispensed by The Manual includes: "Firstly, you must be [[wiktionary:skint|skint]] and on [[Jobseeker's Allowance|the dole]]. Anybody with a proper job or tied up with full time education will not have the time to devote to see it through... Being on the dole gives you a clearer perspective on how much of society is run... having no money sharpens the wits. Forces you never to make the wrong decision. There is no safety net to catch you when you fall." and "If you are already a musician stop playing your instrument. Even better, sell the junk." The book also foretells its own imminent irrelevance, The Timelords admitting that they are writing "a book that will be completely redundant within twelve months. An obsolete &lt;!-- see MOS:PMC concerning dialectical "artifact" spelling --&gt; artefact. Its only use being a bit of a social history that records the aspirations of a certain strata {{sic}} in British society in the late eighties..."

The book was prophetic about recording technology: "It's obvious that in a very short space of time the Japanese will have delivered the technology and then brought the price of it down so that you can do the whole thing at home. Then you will be able to sod off all that crap about going into studios."&lt;!-- is this too long? --&gt;

Bill Drummond explained his motivations in an interview: "It was an excuse to say a lot of things I wanted to say about how the industry worked. It was an excuse to go out and say to people all they can say to themselves: If you want to do something, go and do it! Don't wait to be asked, don't wait for a record company to come and want to sign you or a management company. Just go and do it. Also, it was saying: If you wanna have number one...you can have it. It won't make you rich, it won't make you happy, but you can have it."&lt;ref name="Bomlagadafshipoing"&gt;{{LibraryOfMu|tl=interview|mu-id=521|title=Bomlagadafshipoing|last=Drummond|first=Bill|subjectlink=Bill Drummond|publisher=[[NRK P2|Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation Radio 2]]&lt;!--(Norwegian national radio house-music show: see https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diskusjon:The_KLF)--&gt;|date=September 1991|mu-transcript-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112917/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=521|archive-date=16 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and reach==
The English-language version of ''The Manual'' has had at least 3 print runs (see ISBNs below), being reissued in 1989 and, with a new foreword by Drummond, in 1998. The book has also been translated into German, and was released as an [[audiobook]] (read by Bela B., drummer of the punk band [[Die Ärzte]]) in Germany in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;''The KLF, Das Handbuch, Der schnelle Weg zum Nr. 1 Hit'', 2 audio CDs read by Bela B. Universal Music, 2003. {{ISBN|3-8291-1352-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with Drummond voicing the foreword, a motivational piece about reaching out for one's dreams today as ‘tomorrow is always too late’. In 2010, the book was published in [[Czech language|Czech]].&lt;ref&gt;'' KLF&amp;nbsp;– Manual (Jak se dostat na vrchol hitparady)'', published in 2010 by J. Brezina and Jakub Jandourek, Czech republic. {{ISBN|978-80-254-6529-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian [[dance music]] band [[Edelweiss (band)|Edelweiss]] took the book as a primary influence: they read the book, borrowed [[ABBA]]'s "[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]", and sold five million copies worldwide with "Bring Me Edelweiss".&lt;ref&gt;{{LibraryOfMu|mu-id=229|last=Longmire|first=Ernie ("Lazlo Nibble")|title=KLF is Gonna Rock Ya!|work=X Magazine|date=1 April 1991|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916121146/http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=229|archive-date=16 September 2016|type=Interview with Bill Drummond}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bill-reviews"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/shelf-life-bill-drummond-reviews-his-own-back-catalogue-1359029.html|title=Shelf life: Bill Drummond reviews his own back catalogue|first=Bill|last=Drummond|authorlink=Bill Drummond|date=19 October 1996|access-date=27 February 2020|publisher=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also proved to be an influence on 2000s British girl group [[The Pipettes]] who formed after reading the book in order to explore "the idea of being a pop machine."&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Laura. "Leaders of the pack", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 1 November 2006 ([http://music.guardian.co.uk/pop/story/0,,1936461,00.html link])&lt;/ref&gt;

In the liner photographs of the [[Chumbawamba]] album ''[[Readymades (album)|Readymades]]'', Boff Whalley is seen to be reading a copy of The Manual. It is a reference to Chumbawamba's earlier success with their hit single, "[[Tubthumping]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

[[Jamie Reynolds]] of [[Klaxons (English band)|Klaxons]] admitted in an interview to reading ''The Manual'' and stated that he "took direct instructions from it.... Get yourself a studio, get a groove going, sing some absolute nonsense over the top, put a [[breakbeat]] behind it, and you're away! That's what I did! That's genuinely it. I read that, I noted down the golden rules of pop, and applied that to what we're doing and made sure that that always applies to everything we do. That way, we always come out with a sort of catchy hit number."&lt;ref&gt;Sherburne, Philip. "ACKNOWLEDGE, AGREE AND REPEAT (sic)", , 24 January 2007 ([http://phs.abstractdynamics.org/2007/01/the_easy_way.html link]) {{Unreliable source?|date=July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==

*{{ISBN|1-899858-65-2}} (1998)
