The '''Viking program''' consisted of a pair of American [[space probe]]s sent to [[Mars]], ''[[Viking 1]]'' and ''[[Viking 2]]''.&lt;ref name="NASA-20061218"&gt;{{cite web |last=Williams |first=David R. Dr. |title=Viking Mission to Mars |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/viking.html |date=December 18, 2006 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=February 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each [[spacecraft]] was composed of two main parts: an [[orbiter]] designed to photograph the surface of Mars from [[orbit]], and a [[Lander (spacecraft)|lander]] designed to study the planet from the surface. The orbiters also served as communication relays for the landers once they touched down.

The Viking program grew from [[NASA]]'s earlier, even more ambitious, [[Voyager program (Mars)|Voyager]] Mars program, which was not related to the successful [[Voyager program|Voyager deep space probes]] of the late 1970s. ''Viking 1'' was launched on August 20, 1975, and the second craft, ''Viking 2'', was launched on September 9, 1975, both riding atop [[Titan IIIE]] rockets with [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] upper stages. ''Viking 1'' entered Mars orbit on June 19, 1976, with ''Viking 2'' following suit on August 7.

After orbiting Mars for more than a month and returning images used for landing site selection, the orbiters and landers detached; the landers then entered the Martian [[atmosphere]] and [[Soft landing (rocketry)|soft-landed]] at the sites that had been chosen. The ''Viking 1'' lander touched down on the surface of Mars on July 20, 1976, and was joined by the ''Viking 2'' lander on September 3. The orbiters continued imaging and performing other scientific operations from orbit while the landers deployed [[Measuring instrument|instrument]]s on the surface.

The project cost roughly US$1 billion in 1970s dollars,&lt;ref name="nssdc-viking1orbiter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.space.com/18234-viking-1.html|title=Viking 1: First U.S. Lander on Mars|newspaper=Space.com|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to about {{Inflation|US-GDP|1|1970|r=0}} billion USD in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars.{{Inflation-fn|US-GDP}} The mission was considered successful and is credited with helping to form most of the body of knowledge about Mars through the late 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://planetary-science.org/mars-research/mars-landings/the-viking-program/| publisher=The Center for Planetary Science| title=The Viking Program| access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://californiasciencecenter.org/exhibits/air-space/mission-to-the-planets/viking-lander | publisher=California Science Center| title=Viking Lander| date=July 3, 2014| access-date=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science objectives==
*Obtain high-resolution images of the Martian surface
*Characterize the structure and composition of the atmosphere and surface
*Search for evidence of [[life on Mars (planet)|life on Mars]]

==Viking orbiters==
The primary objectives of the two Viking orbiters were to transport the landers to Mars, perform reconnaissance to locate and certify landing sites, act as communications relays for the landers, and to perform their own scientific investigations. Each orbiter, based on the earlier [[Mariner 9]] spacecraft, was an [[octagon]] approximately 2.5 m across. The fully fueled orbiter-lander pair had a [[mass]] of 3527&amp;nbsp;kg. After separation and landing, the lander had a mass of about {{Nowrap|600 kg}} and the orbiter {{Nowrap|900 kg.}} The total launch mass was {{Nowrap|2328 kg,}} of which {{Nowrap|1445 kg}} were propellant and [[attitude control]] gas. The eight faces of the ring-like structure were 0.4572 m high and were alternately 1.397 and 0.508 m wide. The overall height was 3.29 m from the lander attachment points on the bottom to the launch vehicle attachment points on top. There were 16 modular compartments, 3 on each of the 4 long faces and one on each short face. Four solar panel wings extended from the [[Coordinate axis|axis]] of the orbiter, the distance from tip to tip of two oppositely extended solar panels was 9.75 m.

===Propulsion===
The main [[Spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] unit was mounted above the [[satellite bus|orbiter bus]]. Propulsion was furnished by a [[bipropellant]] ([[monomethylhydrazine]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide]]) liquid-fueled [[rocket engine]] which could be [[gimbal]]led up to 9 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s. The engine was capable of {{convert|1323|N|lbf|abbr=on|lk=on}} thrust, providing a [[delta-V|change in velocity]] of 1480 [[metres per second|m/s]]. [[Attitude control]] was achieved by 12 small compressed-nitrogen jets.

===Navigation and communication===
An acquisition [[Sun sensor]], a cruise Sun sensor, a [[Canopus]] [[star tracker]] and an inertial reference unit consisting of six [[gyroscope]]s allowed three-axis stabilization. Two [[accelerometers]] were also on board. Communications were accomplished through a {{Nowrap|20 W}} [[S-band]] (2.3 [[gigahertz|GHz]]) [[transmitter]] and two {{Nowrap|20 W}} [[TWTA]]s. An [[X-band|X band]] {{Nowrap|(8.4&amp;nbsp;GHz)}} [[downlink]] was also added specifically for [[Doppler effect|radio science]] and to conduct communications experiments. [[Uplink]] was via S band {{Nowrap|(2.1&amp;nbsp;GHz).}} A two-axis steerable [[Directional antenna|parabolic dish antenna]] with a diameter of approximately 1.5 m was attached at one edge of the orbiter base, and a fixed low-gain antenna extended from the top of the bus. Two tape recorders were each capable of storing 1280 [[megabit]]s. A 381-[[MHz]] relay radio was also available.

===Power===
The power to the two orbiter craft was provided by eight 1.57 × 1.23 m [[solar panels]], two on each wing. The solar panels comprised a total of 34,800 solar cells and produced 620 W of power at Mars. Power was also stored in two [[nickel-cadmium]] 30-[[Ampere-hour|A·h]] [[battery (electricity)|batteries]].

The combined area of the four panels was {{convert|15|m2|ft2|abbr=off|sp=us}}, and they provided both regulated and unregulated direct current power; unregulated power was provided to the radio transmitter and the lander.

Two 30-amp-hour, nickel-cadmium, rechargeable batteries provided power when the spacecraft was not facing the Sun, and during launch, correction maneuvers and Mars occultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/fact_sheets/viking.pdfx|title=Sitemap – NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory|accessdate=March 27, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304104054/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/fact_sheets/viking.pdfx|archive-date=March 4, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main findings===
[[File:Mars Valles Marineris.jpeg|thumb|Mars image mosaic from the ''Viking 1'' orbiter]]
By discovering many geological forms that are typically formed from large amounts of water, the images from the orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about [[water on Mars]]. Huge river valleys were found in many areas. They showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and travelled thousands of kilometers. Large areas in the southern hemisphere contained branched stream networks, suggesting that rain once fell. The flanks of some volcanoes are believed to have been exposed to rainfall because they resemble those caused on Hawaiian volcanoes. Many craters look as if the impactor fell into mud. When they were formed, ice in the soil may have melted, turned the ground into mud, then flowed across the surface. Normally, material from an impact goes up, then down. It does not flow across the surface, going around obstacles, as it does on some Martian craters.&lt;ref name="Kieffer1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh H. Kieffer|title=Mars|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NoDvAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=March 7, 2011|date=1992|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=978-0-8165-1257-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raeburn, P. 1998.

Mitchell Beazley Publishers NY, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Regions, called "[[Martian chaos terrain|Chaotic Terrain]]," seemed to have quickly lost great volumes of water, causing large channels to be formed. The amount of water involved was estimated to ten thousand times the flow of the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref&gt;Morton, O. 2002. Mapping Mars. Picador, NY, NY&lt;/ref&gt; Underground volcanism may have melted frozen ice; the water then flowed away and the ground collapsed to leave chaotic terrain.

==Viking landers==
[[File:Sagan Viking.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Sagan]] with a model of a Viking lander.]]
[[File:Viking Lander Model.jpg|thumb|left|Background painting by Don Davis, Artist's concept of Mars' surface behind a Viking lander test article pictured at JPL. The "sandbox".]]  
Each lander comprised a six-sided aluminium base with alternate {{convert|1.09|and|0.56|m|abbr=on}} long sides, supported on three extended legs attached to the shorter sides. The leg footpads formed the vertices of an equilateral triangle with {{convert|2.21|m|abbr=on}} sides when viewed from above, with the long sides of the base forming a straight line with the two adjoining footpads. Instrumentation was attached inside and on top of the base, elevated above the surface by the extended legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Mechanics|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Amazing Search for Life On Mars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aOIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66|date=June 1976|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each lander was enclosed in an [[aeroshell]] heat shield designed to slow the lander down during the entry phase. To prevent contamination of Mars by Earth organisms, each lander, upon assembly and enclosure within the aeroshell, was enclosed in a pressurized "bioshield" and then [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] at a temperature of {{convert|111|°C|sp=us}} for 40 hours. For thermal reasons, the cap of the bioshield was jettisoned after the Centaur upper stage powered the Viking orbiter/lander combination out of Earth orbit.&lt;ref&gt;Soffen, G. A., and C. W. Snyder, First Viking mission to Mars, ''Science'', 193, 759–766, August 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
    
===Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL)===
Each lander arrived at Mars attached to the orbiter. The assembly orbited Mars many times before the lander was released and separated from the orbiter for descent to the surface. Descent comprised four distinct phases, starting with a [[Deorbit#Deorbit and re-entry|deorbit burn]]. The lander then experienced [[atmospheric entry]] with peak heating occurring a few seconds after the start of frictional heating with the Martian atmosphere. At an altitude of about {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us}} and traveling at a velocity of 900 kilometers per hour (600&amp;nbsp;mph), the parachute deployed, the aeroshell released and the lander's legs unfolded. At an altitude of about 1.5 kilometers (5,000 feet), the lander activated its three retro-engines and was released from the parachute. The lander then immediately used [[retrorockets]] to slow and control its descent, with a [[soft landing (rocketry)|soft landing]] on the surface of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astro.if.ufrgs.br/solar/viking.htm Viking]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wide image|Mars_Viking_12a001.png|800px|First "clear" image ever transmitted from the surface of Mars – shows [[List of rocks on Mars#Viking|rocks]] near the ''[[Viking 1]]'' lander (July 20, 1976).}}

===Propulsion===

Propulsion for deorbit was provided by the [[monopropellant]] [[hydrazine]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), through a rocket with 12 [[Rocket engine nozzles|nozzle]]s arranged in four clusters of three that provided {{convert|32|N|lk=in|sp=us}} thrust, translating to a [[delta-V|change in velocity]] of {{convert|180|m/s|abbr=on}}. These nozzles also acted as the control [[Spacecraft propulsion|thrusters]] for [[translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]] of the lander.

Terminal [[descent (aircraft)|descent]] (after use of a [[parachute]]) and [[landing]] utilized three (one affixed on each long side of the base, separated by 120 degrees) monopropellant hydrazine engines. The engines had 18 [https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/_/fgFN2s2GG-OfQA nozzles] to disperse the exhaust and minimize effects on the ground, and were [[throttle]]able from {{convert|276|to|2667|N|lk=in|sp=us}}. The hydrazine was purified in order to prevent contamination of the Martian surface with Earth [[microbes]]. The lander carried {{convert|85|kg|abbr=on}} of propellant at launch, contained in two spherical [[titanium]] tanks mounted on opposite sides of the lander beneath the RTG windscreens, giving a total launch mass of {{convert|657|kg|abbr=on}}. Control was achieved through the use of an [[inertial reference unit]], four [[gyroscope|gyros]], a [[radar altimeter]], a terminal descent and landing [[radar]], and the control thrusters.

===Power===
Power was provided by two [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG) units containing [[plutonium|plutonium-238]] affixed to opposite sides of the lander base and covered by wind screens. Each [https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/_/twFyqw9QR3uOoQ Viking RTG] was {{convert|28|cm|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|58|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, had a mass of {{convert|13.6|kg|abbr=on}} and provided 30 watts continuous power at 4.4 volts. Four [[wet cell]] sealed nickel-cadmium 8 [[ampere-hours|Ah]] (28,800 [[coulomb]]s), 28 volt [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]] were also on board to handle peak power loads.

===Payload===
[[File:Viking2lander1.jpg|thumb|right|Image from Mars taken by the ''Viking 2'' lander]] 
Communications were accomplished through a 20-watt S-band transmitter using two [[traveling-wave tube]]s. A two-axis steerable high-gain parabolic antenna was mounted on a boom near one edge of the lander base. An [[omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]] low-gain S-band antenna also extended from the base. Both these antennae allowed for communication directly with the Earth, permitting Viking 1 to continue to work long after both orbiters had failed. A [[UHF]] {{Nowrap|(381 MHz)}} antenna provided a one-way relay to the orbiter using a 30 watt relay radio. Data storage was on a 40-Mbit tape recorder, and the lander computer had a 6000-[[Word (data type)|word]] memory for command instructions.

The lander carried instruments to achieve the primary scientific objectives of the lander mission: to study the [[biology]], chemical composition ([[organic compound|organic]] and [[inorganic]]), [[meteorology]], [[seismology]], [[magnetism|magnetic]] properties, appearance, and physical properties of the Martian surface and atmosphere. Two 360-degree cylindrical scan cameras were mounted near one long side of the base. From the center of this side extended the sampler arm, with a collector head, [[Sensor#Thermal|temperature sensor]], and [[magnet]] on the end. A [[Climate of Mars|meteorology]] boom, holding temperature, wind direction, and wind velocity sensors extended out and up from the top of one of the lander legs. A [[seismometer]], magnet and camera [[test target]]s, and magnifying [[mirror]] are mounted opposite the cameras, near the high-gain antenna. An interior environmentally controlled compartment held the [[biology]] experiment and the [[gas chromatography|gas chromatograph]] mass spectrometer. The [[X-ray]] [[fluorescence]] spectrometer was also mounted within the structure. A [[pressure]] sensor was attached under the lander body. The scientific [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]] had a total mass of approximately {{convert|91|kg|abbr=on}}.

===Biological experiments===
{{Main|Viking biological experiments}}
The Viking landers conducted [[Viking biological experiments|biological experiments]] designed to detect [[life on Mars (planet)|life in the Martian soil]] (if it existed) with experiments designed by three separate teams, under the direction of chief scientist [[Gerald Soffen]] of NASA. One experiment turned positive for the detection of [[metabolism]] (current life), but based on the results of the other two experiments that failed to reveal any [[Organic matter|organic molecules]] in the soil, most scientists became convinced that the positive results were likely caused by non-biological chemical reactions from highly oxidizing soil conditions.&lt;ref name=Beegle &gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Concept for NASA's Mars 2016 Astrobiology Field Laboratory|journal=Astrobiology|date=August 2007|first=LUTHER W.|last=BEEGLE|display-authors=etal |volume=7 | issue = 4|pmid=17723090 |pages=545–577|doi=10.1089/ast.2007.0153|bibcode=2007AsBio...7..545B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there was a pronouncement by NASA during the mission, that the Viking lander results did not demonstrate conclusive [[biosignature]]s in soils at the two landing sites, the test results and their limitations are still under assessment. The validity of the positive 'Labeled Release' (LR) results hinged entirely on the absence of an oxidative agent in the Martian soil, but one was later discovered by the [[Phoenix lander]] in the form of [[perchlorate]] salts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-sci-phoenix6-2008aug06,0,4986721.story|title=Perchlorate found in Martian soil|date=August 6, 2008|work=Los Angeles Times|last=Johnson|first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/08/080805192122.htm|website=Science Daily|date=August 6, 2008|title=Martian Life Or Not?

The question of microbial life on Mars remains unresolved. Nonetheless, on April 12, 2012, an international team of scientists reported studies, based on mathematical speculation through [[complexity analysis]] of the [[Viking biological experiments#Labeled Release|Labeled Release experiments]] of the 1976 Viking Mission, that may suggest the detection of "extant microbial life on Mars."&lt;ref name="Bianciardi-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bianciardi |first1=Giorgio |last2=Miller |first2=Joseph D. |last3=Straat |first3=Patricia Ann |last4=Levin |first4=Gilbert V. |title=Complexity Analysis of the Viking Labeled Release Experiments |url=http://ijass.org/PublishedPaper/year_abstract.asp?idx=132 |journal=IJASS |date=March 2012 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=14–26 |accessdate=April 15, 2012 |doi=10.5139/IJASS.2012.13.1.14 |bibcode=2012IJASS..13...14B |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415162537/http://ijass.org/PublishedPaper/year_abstract.asp?idx=132 |archivedate=April 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Discovery-20120412"&gt;{{cite web |last=Klotz |first=Irene |title=Mars Viking Robots 'Found Life' |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/mars-life-viking-landers-discovery-120412.html |date=April 12, 2012 |publisher=[[Discovery Channel|DiscoveryNews]] |accessdate=April 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, new findings from re-examination of the Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer (GCMS) results were published in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guzman|first=Melissa|last2=McKay|first2=Christopher P.|last3=Quinn|first3=Richard C.|last4=Szopa|first4=Cyril|last5=Davila|first5=Alfonso F.|last6=Navarro‐González|first6=Rafael|last7=Freissinet|first7=Caroline|date=2018|title=Identification of Chlorobenzene in the Viking Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer Data Sets: Reanalysis of Viking Mission Data Consistent With Aromatic Organic Compounds on Mars|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets|language=en|volume=123|issue=7|pages=1674–1683|doi=10.1029/2018JE005544|bibcode=2018JGRE..123.1674G|issn=2169-9100}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

===Camera/imaging system===
The leader of the imaging team was [[Thomas A. Mutch]], a geologist at [[Brown University]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. The camera uses a movable mirror to illuminate 12 photo diodes. Each of the 12 silicon diodes are designed to be sensitive to different frequences of light. Several diodes are placed to focus accurately at distances between six and 43 feet away from the lander.

The cameras scanned at a rate of five vertical scan lines per second, each composed of 512 pixels. The 300 degree panorama images were composed of 9150 lines. The cameras scan was slow enough that in a crew shot several members show up several times in the shot as they moved themselves as the camera scanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-425/ch8.htm|title=The Martian Landscape|author=The Viking Lander Imaging Team|publisher=NASA|date=1978|chapter=Chapter 8: Cameras Without Pictures|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/21/archives/viking-cameras-light-in-weight-use-little-power-work-slowly.html|title=Viking Cameras Light in Weight, Use Little Power, Work Slowly|last=McElheny|first=Victor K.|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 21, 1976|accessdate=September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control systems==
The Viking landers used a Guidance, Control and Sequencing Computer (GCSC) consisting of two [[Honeywell]] HDC 402 24-bit computers with 18K of [[Plated wire memory|plated-wire memory]], while the Viking orbiters used a Command Computer Subsystem (CCS) using two custom-designed 18-bit serial processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Tomayko|first=James|publisher=NASA|date=April 1987|url=https://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch5-6.html|accessdate=February 6, 2010|title=Computers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Holmberg|first=Neil A.|author2=Robert P.

==Financial cost of the Viking program==
The two orbiters cost US$217 million (at the time), which is about {{Inflation|r=0|US-GDP|.217|1970}} billion USD in year-{{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars.&lt;ref name="marsmoney"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Dy6z6DQDNoC&amp;pg=PA68|title=Faster, Better, Cheaper: Low-Cost Innovation in the U.S. Space Program|last=McCurdy|first=Howard E.|date=2001|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-6720-0|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The most expensive single part of the program was the lander's life-detection unit, which cost about 60 million then or {{Inflation|r=-2|US-GDP|60|1970}} million USD in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} year-dollars.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Development of the Viking lander design cost US$357 million.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt; This was decades before NASA's "faster, better, cheaper" approach, and Viking needed to pioneer unprecedented technologies under national pressure brought on by the [[Cold War]] and the aftermath of the [[Space Race]], all under the prospect of possibly discovering extraterrestrial life for the first time.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt; The experiments had to adhere to a special 1971 directive that mandated that no single failure shall stop the return of more than one experiment{{mdash}}a difficult and expensive task for a device with over 40,000 parts.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt;

The Viking camera system cost US$27.3 million to develop, or about {{Inflation|r=-2|US-GDP|27.3|1970}} million in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} year-dollars.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When the Imaging system design was completed, it was difficult to find anyone who could manufacture its advanced design.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt; The program managers were later praised for fending off pressure to go with a simpler, less advanced imaging system, especially when the views rolled in.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt; The program did save some money by cutting out a third lander and reducing the number of experiments on the lander.&lt;ref name=marsmoney/&gt;

Overall NASA says that US$1 billion in 1970s dollars was spent on the program,&lt;ref name="nssdc-viking1orbiter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt; which when inflation-adjusted to {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars is about {{Inflation|r=0|US-GDP|1|1970}} billion USD.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;As the Viking program was a government expense, the inflation index of the United States [[Nominal GDP|Nominal Gross Domestic Product]] per capita is used for the inflation-adjusting calculation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission end==
The craft eventually failed, one by one, as follows:&lt;ref name="NASA-20061218" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
! Craft || Arrival date || Shut-off date || Operational lifetime || Cause of failure
|-
| ''Viking 2'' orbiter || August 7, 1976 || July 25, 1978 || 1 year, 11 months, 18 days || Shut down after fuel leak in propulsion system.
|-
| ''Viking 2'' lander || September 3, 1976 || April 11, 1980 || 3 years, 7 months, 8 days || Shut down after battery failure.
|-
| ''Viking 1'' orbiter || June 19, 1976 || August 17, 1980 || 4 years, 1-month, 19 days || Shut down after depletion of [[attitude control]] fuel.
|-
| ''Viking 1'' lander || July 20, 1976 || November 13, 1982 || 6 years, 3 months, 22 days || Shut down after human error during software update caused the lander's antenna to go down, terminating power and communication.
|}
The Viking program ended on May 21, 1983. To prevent an imminent impact with Mars the orbit of ''Viking 1'' orbiter was raised on August 7, 1980 before it was shut down 10 days later. Impact and potential contamination on the planet's surface is possible from 2019 onwards.&lt;ref name="nssdc-viking1orbiter"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=1975-075A |title=Viking 1 Orbiter spacecraft details |accessdate=July 10, 2019 |date=March 20, 2019 |work=[[NASA Space Science Data Coordinated Archive]] |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Viking 1'' lander was found to be about 6 kilometers from its planned landing site by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in December 2006.
