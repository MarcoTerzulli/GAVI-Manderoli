'''''Wicked''''' is a 2003 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical by [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] and book by [[Winnie Holzman]]. It is based on the 1995 [[Gregory Maguire]] novel ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West]]'', itself a retelling of the classic 1900 novel, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' by [[L. Frank Baum]] and the 1939 [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.

The musical is told from the perspective of the [[Witchcraft|witches]] of the [[Land of Oz]]; its plot begins before and continues after [[Dorothy Gale]] arrives in Oz from [[Kansas]], and includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. ''Wicked'' tells the story of two unlikely friends, [[Elphaba]] (the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]) and Galinda (whose name later changes to [[Glinda the Good Witch]]), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard]]'s corrupt government, and, ultimately, Elphaba's private fall from grace.

Produced by Universal Stage Productions in coalition with [[Marc E. Platt|Marc Platt]], Jon B. Platt and [[David Stone (producer)|David Stone]], with direction by [[Joe Mantello]] and choreography by [[Wayne Cilento]], the original production of ''Wicked'' premiered on Broadway at the [[Gershwin Theatre]] in October 2003, after completing pre-Broadway tryouts at San Francisco's [[Curran Theatre]] in May/June of that same year. Its original stars included [[Idina Menzel]] as Elphaba, [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Glinda, and [[Joel Grey]] as the Wizard.&lt;ref name="ibdb"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=13485 |title=Wicked |accessdate= November 8, 2007 |work= [[Internet Broadway Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Broadway production won three [[Tony Award]]s and seven [[Drama Desk Award]]s, while its original cast album received a [[Grammy Award]].

''Wicked'' celebrated its sixteenth anniversary on Broadway on October 30, 2019. On October 28, 2019, with its 6,681st performance, it surpassed ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|''Les Misérables'']]'' to become Broadway's [[List of the longest-running Broadway shows|fifth-longest running show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadway.com/buzz/197390/wicked-surpasses-les-miserables-as-fifth-longest-running-show-in-broadway-history/|title=Wicked Surpasses Les Misérables as Fifth-Longest-Running Show in Broadway History|last=Lefkowitz|first=Andy|date=October 28, 2019|website=Broadway Buzz|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical performance takes approximately two hours and 30 minutes, plus a 15-minute intermission.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web |title=Wicked: The Show |url= http://www.wickedthemusical.com/the-show |accessdate= February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the Broadway production has spawned several other productions worldwide, including various North American productions, a long-running [[Laurence Olivier Award]]–nominated [[West End theatre|West End]] production, and a series of international productions. Since its 2003 debut, ''Wicked'' has broken box-office records around the world, currently holding weekly-gross-takings records in Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Louis, and London. In the week ending January 2, 2011, the London, Broadway, and both North American touring productions simultaneously broke their respective records for the highest weekly gross.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.

==Inception and development==
[[File:Stephen Schwartz.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Wicked'' composer and lyricist [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]]]
Composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz discovered Maguire's 1995 novel ''Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West'' while on vacation, and saw its potential for a dramatic adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/recordings/bucchino.htm |title=John Bucchino and the Origins of Wicked |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=MusicalSchwartz.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Maguire had released the [[intellectual property|rights]] to [[Universal Pictures]], which had planned to develop a live-action feature film.&lt;ref name="rightstowicked"&gt;{{cite news |title='Wicked' blesses Schwartz|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/05/11/PK307065.DTL|work=San Francisco Chronicle|first=Steven|last=Winn|date=May 11, 2003|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Schwartz persuaded Maguire to release the rights to a stage production&lt;ref name="briefhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wickedwestend.co.uk/articles-reviews/wicked-history.htm |title=Wicked – A Brief History |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |work=Wicked West End |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227074259/http://www.wickedwestend.co.uk/articles-reviews/wicked-history.htm |archivedate=December 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while also making what Schwartz called an "impassioned plea" to Universal producer [[Marc E. Platt|Marc Platt]] to realize Schwartz's own intended adaptation. Persuaded, Platt signed on as joint producer of the project with Universal and David Stone.&lt;ref name=rightstowicked/&gt;

The novel, described as a political, social, and ethical commentary on the nature of good and evil, takes place in the [[Land of Oz]], in the years leading to [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]'s arrival. The story centers on [[Elphaba]], the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious [[Wicked Witch of the West]] and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]] the [[Good Witch of the South]]. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters, and situations from Baum's ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' (1900) and its [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]] in new ways. It is designed to set the reader thinking about what it really is to be "Wicked", and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script.&lt;ref name=briefhistory/&gt; To this end, he collaborated with [[Emmy Award]]–winning writer [[Winnie Holzman]] to develop the outline of the plot over the course of a year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-holzman.htm |title=Winnie Holzman – Wicked's book writer |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt; while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.&lt;ref name=briefhistory/&gt;

While the draft followed Maguire's idea of retelling the story of the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation "goes far afield" from the novel. As Holzman observed in an interview with ''[[Playbill]]'', "It was [Maguire's] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops&amp;nbsp;– and really the whole plot&amp;nbsp;– is different onstage."&lt;ref name="playbill 2"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Michael |last=Buckley |title=STAGE TO SCREENS: A Chat with Wicked Nominee and TV Veteran Winnie Holzman |date=June 6, 2004 |url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |work=Playbill |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121164650/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz justified the deviation, saying "Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda&amp;nbsp;– who becomes Glinda&amp;nbsp;– and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies."&lt;ref name="script"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-script.htm |title=Wicked – Script |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda - and eventually becoming the [[Tin Woodman]] instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, Doctor Dillamond not being murdered, and Madame Morrible going to prison instead of dying.&lt;ref name=" novel"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Maguire, Gregory | title=Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West | publisher=[[ReganBooks]] | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-06-039144-7 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wickedlifetim00magu }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:San Francisco Curran Theatre 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Curran Theatre]] in San Francisco, where ''Wicked'' made its debut]]
The [[Libretto|book]], lyrics, and score for the musical were developed through a series of readings.&lt;ref name=briefhistory/&gt; For these developmental workshops, [[Kristin Chenoweth]], the [[Tony Award]]–winning actress whom Schwartz had in mind while composing the music for the character,&lt;ref name="grimmerie"&gt;{{Cite book | author=David Cote | title=Wicked: The Grimmerie: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Hit Broadway Musical |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4013-0820-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; joined the project as Glinda. [[Stephanie J. Block]] played Elphaba in all of the workshops (she was the original Elphaba in the first national tour, and joined the Broadway cast later on) before fellow performer [[Idina Menzel]] was cast in the role in late 2000. Earlier that same year, the creators recruited New York producer Stone, who began the transition of the workshop production into a full Broadway production. [[Joe Mantello]] was brought in as director and [[Wayne Cilento]] as choreographer while Tony Award-winning designer [[Eugene Lee (designer)|Eugene Lee]] created the set and visual style for the production based on both [[William Wallace Denslow|W. W. Denslow]]'s original illustrations for Baum's novels and Maguire's concept of the story being told through a giant clock.&lt;ref name=grimmerie/&gt; Costume designer [[Susan Hilferty]] created a "twisted [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]]" style through more than 200 costumes, while lighting designer [[Kenneth Posner]] used more than 800 individual lights to give each of the 54 distinct scenes and locations "its own mood".&lt;ref name=grimmerie/&gt; By April 2003, a full cast had been assembled and the show readied its debut.&lt;ref name=grimmerie/&gt;

Following the out-of-town tryout in San Francisco, which received mixed critical reception, the creative team made extensive changes before its transfer to Broadway.&lt;ref name=grimmerie/&gt; Speaking about the changes, Holzman said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Stephen [Schwartz] wisely had insisted on having three months to rewrite in between the time we closed in San Francisco and when we were to go back into rehearsals in New York. That was crucial; that was the thing that made the biggest difference in the life of the show. That time is what made the show work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wicked the Musical in San Francisco |url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-sf.htm |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elements of the book were rewritten, while several songs underwent minor transformations.&lt;ref name="grimmerie" /&gt; This included the excision of "Which Way is the Party?", the introductory song to the character Fiyero, which was replaced by "Dancing Through Life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wicked Lyrics and Song Stories – "Dancing Through Life"|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-lyrics-5.htm|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concern existed that Menzel's Elphaba "got a little overshadowed" by Chenoweth's Glinda,&lt;ref name="elphiechanges"&gt;
{{cite web|title=Wicked History--"There's No Place Like Home: Wicked Returns to San Francisco"|url=http://www.defyinggravitythebook.com/wicked/wicked-san-francisco.htm|accessdate=August 21, 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' critic Robert Hurwitt writing, "Menzel's brightly intense Elphaba the Wicked Witch [needs] a chance of holding her own alongside Chenoweth's gloriously, insidiously bubbly Glinda".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/06/12/DD278614.DTL |title=Every witch way |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |first=Robert |last=Hurwitt |date=June 12, 2003 |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the creative team set about making Elphaba "more prominent".&lt;ref name="elphiechanges" /&gt; On the subject of the Broadway revisions, Schwartz recalled, "It was clear there was work to be done and revisions to be made in the book and the score. The critical community was, frankly, very helpful to us."&lt;ref name="elphiechanges" /&gt;

==Synopsis==
===Act I===
In the [[Land of Oz]], the Ozians are rejoicing over the demise of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West. [[Glinda the Good Witch]] discusses Elphaba's past, wherein Elphaba's mother had had an affair with another man, after Elphaba's father, the [[governor]] of [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], goes out of town. As her mother has this affair, her lover gives her a green [[potion]], and she drinks it. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl with [[green]] skin ("No One Mourns the Wicked"). An Ozian asks Glinda if she and Elphaba were friends. She reluctantly admits that they were, leading Glinda to tell them the story of how they became best friends. A [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] starts with a scene at the [[college]], Shiz University, when Elphaba arrives with her father and younger sister, [[Nessarose]] ("Dear Old Shiz"). Due to her green skin, Elphaba's father resents her and showers his affection on Nessarose, who is [[Physical disability|physically disabled]] and uses a wheelchair, due to a birth defect that contributed to their mother's death in childbirth. As their father says goodbye, he gives Nessarose a pair of [[Silver Shoes|silver slippers]]. The headshiztress and [[Witchcraft|witch]], [[Madam Morrible]], decides to take Nessarose under her protection because Nessarose is disabled and her father's favorite, leaving Elphaba and the beautiful and popular Galinda as roommates, to their chagrin. Elphaba attempts to take back her sister, and her anger makes Nessarose come back into her hands, [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]]. Madame Morrible recognizes that Elphaba has special powers, and decides to teach her [[Magic (fantasy)|sorcery]]. She tells Elphaba her powers might allow her to one day work with the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wonderful Wizard of Oz]], something Elphaba has dreamed of her whole life ("[[The Wizard and I]]"). Both Galinda and Elphaba dislike each other ("What Is This Feeling?") and they fight constantly, even in their classes, such as their history class with [[List of Wicked characters|Dr. Dillamond]], a [[goat]], who as the only animal professor at the university is beginning to suffer from [[discrimination]]. He tells Elphaba a conspiracy is afoot to stop animals from speaking, and she wants to let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it ("Something Bad").

Later, the [[Winkie Country|Winkie]] Prince [[List of Wicked characters|Fiyero Tiggular]] arrives at Shiz and introduces the other students to his philosophy of simply "Dancing through life". Fiyero decides to have an orientation party at the Ozdust Ballroom, that evening, and everyone agrees to go. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to ask her to dance with him at the party, but she convinces him to ask Nessarose out, instead, in order to shoo him away, leaving Galinda free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose, who has a crush on Boq, is delighted and tells her sister how Galinda made it happen and how happy it has made her. Galinda gives a black witch's hat to Elphaba to wear at the party, as a [[Practical joke|prank]]. At the party that evening, Boq tries to tell Nessarose the real reason he invited her but is too nice to hurt her feelings ("Dancing Through Life"). She continues to fall for him. Madame Morrible arrives to tell Galinda she can join her sorcery class, at Elphaba's obliging request, and gives her a wand. Elphaba arrives wearing the witch's hat, only to find the other students laughing and staring while she awkwardly dances alone. Galinda feels regretful and starts dancing with Elphaba. Soon, everyone joins them, and the two girls look at each other in a new light. Back in their room, they continue to bond, by sharing secrets. Galinda tells Elphaba that she plans to marry Fiyero and Elphaba tells Galinda about the bottle of green potion, which she sleeps with behind her pillow. The bottle belonged to her mother, who had died giving birth to Nessarose. Their mother had chewed [[Cotoneaster lacteus|milk flowers]] in order for Nessarose to not be born with green skin. Elphaba tells Galinda that she blames herself for her mother's death and her father's resentment. Galinda then decides to give Elphaba a makeover ("[[Popular (Wicked song)|Popular]]").

The next day in class, Dr. Dillamond tells the students that he has been excommunicated. Elphaba wants to help, but no one will stand up with her. Afterward, a replacement teacher arrives and introduces the students to the [[cage]], which will keep animals controlled, so they never learn to speak. The cage being shown contains a small [[lion]] cub. Elphaba's fury cannot be contained, and she accidentally casts a spell on her fellow students, causing them to gyrate involuntarily. She and Fiyero steal the lion cub in the cage and escape. They share a tender moment before he leaves, embarrassed, to free the lion cub. Elphaba reminds herself how pointless it is to wish for something to happen between them, for he loves Galinda, as it starts to [[rain]] ("I'm Not That Girl"). Madame Morrible comes to tell her that the Wizard has decided to meet her. Nessarose and Galinda come to see her off, and Fiyero meets her too. Fiyero gives Elphaba a bouquet of [[Poppy|poppy flowers]] but ignores Galinda. Galinda tries to win Fiyero's respect by changing her name to ‘Glinda’, in solidarity with Dr. Dillamond, who always mispronounced her name, but Fiyero is not impressed, saying goodbye to Elphaba, instead. Elphaba invites Glinda to the [[Emerald City]] with her ("One Short Day").

The girls meet the Wizard of Oz, who turns out to be not quite as intimidating as they thought ("A Sentimental Man"). He promises Elphaba that he will grant her request if she proves herself. Madame Morrible appears; she is the Wizard's new ‘press secretary’. She gives Elphaba an ancient book of spells, called the ''[[Grimoire|Grimmerie]]'', which only the magically gifted can read. Elphaba is asked to try a [[levitation]] spell on the Wizard's monkey servant, [[Chistery|Chistery]]. However, the spell does not go the way Elphaba plans. [[Winged monkeys|Chistery sprouts wings]], and she realizes that the Wizard is the one behind the suppression of the animals. Elphaba realizes the Wizard has no powers and he is merely a fraud. She runs away, and to prevent the truth from getting out, Madam Morrible spreads reports that Elphaba is a ‘wicked [[Witchcraft|witch]]’. Elphaba then swears revenge on the Wizard for removing speech from the animals. She performs a spell on a [[broom]] and flies away from the Emerald City ("[[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]]").

===Act II===
Sometime later, Elphaba's opposition to the Wizard's regime has earned her the title ’[[Wicked Witch of the West]]’. Glinda has become the positive public front of the Wizard's regime, given the title ‘[[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good]]’ and positioned by The Wizard as the nation's defender against Elphaba ("No One Mourns the Wicked" (reprise)). A press conference to celebrate Fiyero's appointment as captain of the guard (a position he accepted to find Elphaba) is hijacked by the crowd's panicked rumors about Elphaba, including a story that she can be melted by water. Fiyero is incredulous and not convinced by Glinda's insistence that Elphaba does not want to be found. He is further angered when Madame Morrible announces his engagement to Glinda and runs off. Glinda attempts to keep a cheerful front for the press, but clearly realizes her dream life has come at a great price ("Thank Goodness").

Elphaba pays a visit to Nessarose, now governor of Munchkinland following the death of their father. Nessarose has [[Tyrant|taken away the rights of the Munchkins]] in a desperate attempt to keep Boq at her side. Elphaba tries to convince her sister to side with her against the Wizard, but Nessarose is more concerned with her own problems. Elphaba tries to help by giving Nessarose the power to walk, by turning the silver slippers into ‘[[ruby slippers]]’. Convinced that Boq must love her now, Nessarose calls for him, but he only sees this as proof that she does not need him anymore, and the opportunity to take his last chance to tell Glinda that he loves her, as she is now engaged to Fiyero. This news breaks Elphaba’s heart, but she isn’t surprised. Hurt, Nessarose takes Elphaba's spellbook and tries to cast a spell to make Boq fall in love with her. Nessarose mispronounces the words to the spell, and accidentally shrinks Boq's heart, earning the title “[[Wicked Witch of the East]]” ("The [[Wicked Witch of the East]]"). Elphaba works another spell to save his life, if in a different condition than he was before. She then tells Nessarose that she has to return to the palace in order to set the monkeys free, however, Nessarose knows that she is only going back to find Fiyero. When Boq awakens, he is disgusted at his new state as a [[Tin Woodman|man made of tin]] and flees the [[mansion]].

Elphaba returns to the Wizard's palace to free the monkey servants and encounters the Wizard. He tries once again to convince her to work with him, telling her that he is not evil, but just an average man who came into his position by chance, and he offers to redeem Elphaba's reputation ("Wonderful"). She is almost won over, until she sees Dr. Dillamond, under a blanket, who has lost the power of speech. Angered by this, Elphaba accuses the Wizard, but he calls the guards to arrest Elphaba. In response, Fiyero and the guards enter, followed by Glinda. However, Fiyero helps Elphaba escape and leaves with her. Although heartbroken at Fiyero switching sides with Elphaba ("I'm Not That Girl" (reprise)), Glinda suggests to the Wizard and Madame Morrible that the way to apprehend Elphaba is to use her sister, Nessarose, as bait, by spreading a rumor that she's in danger, allowing the officials to capture Elphaba once and for all. Madame Morrible agrees and conjures a [[tornado]].

Elphaba and Fiyero are both taken by surprise by the strength of their feelings for each other, and promise to always be together ("As Long As You're Mine"). Their happiness is interrupted when Elphaba has a vision of Nessarose being in danger and sees a house flying through the air in a [[tornado]]. Before Elphaba leaves to investigate, Fiyero tells her about a castle, Kiamo Ko, that his family owns and in which she can stay.

Glinda and Elphaba meet in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], the site where Nessarose has been crushed by a house with a girl named [[Dorothy Gale]] and a dog named [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] inside. Upon arriving, Elphaba finds out that Glinda has given Dorothy Nessarose's ruby slippers and sent her on her way on the [[yellow brick road]]. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument and fight. The guards arrive to arrest Elphaba. Fiyero arrives and holds Glinda hostage until Elphaba is allowed to go free. Glinda pleads for the guards not to harm him, but they do not listen, as they escort Fiyero to a nearby cornfield where they can interrogate and torture him (by [[crucifixion]]). Elphaba tries to cast a spell to protect him but is crestfallen by the limitations of her power. She decides that from this point on, she will live up to her reputation ("[[No Good Deed (song)|No Good Deed]]").

Later, back at Oz's capital, all of its citizens unite, declaring war on Elphaba, due to the now full-grown [[Cowardly Lion|lion]], that Elphaba and Fiyero rescued, and Boq's testimony against her. Meanwhile, Glinda has realized Madam Morrible, who can control the weather, is responsible for Nessarose's death. Glinda flees in horror to warn Elphaba, as the angry mob sets out to take Kiamo Ko ("March of the Witch Hunters").

Back at the castle, Elphaba has captured Dorothy and Toto, refusing to release them until Dorothy gives Elphaba Nessarose's ruby slippers – the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's [[castle]] to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy and Toto go. Elphaba refuses until she receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the ''Grimmerie'' to Glinda. The two friends embrace for the last time, before saying goodbye ("For Good"). As the mob arrives, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches helplessly from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, 'melting' her. Shaken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her hat and the bottle of the green potion that her mother drank.

In the Emerald City, Glinda confronts the Wizard with Elphaba's bottle, which he recognizes as identical to his own. He was Elphaba's biological father, her mother's lover, and the cause of her green skin. He breaks down in sorrow, and Madame Morrible surmises that Elphaba's powers were so strong because she was a child of two worlds. Glinda banishes the Wizard from Oz and sends Madame Morrible to [[prison]].

Meanwhile, back at Kiamo Ko, Fiyero (now a [[Scarecrow (Oz)|scarecrow]]) comes to the spot where Elphaba melted. Making sure that no one is watching, he knocks on the floor and out from a trap door steps Elphaba, very much alive; she had pretended to melt to convince her enemies of her death and to be with Fiyero, who was transformed into a scarecrow by her spell. Before leaving, Elphaba regrets that she will never see Glinda again and tell her that they are alive. Simultaneously, the musical returns to its starting point. Glinda finishes the story and promises the people of Oz that she will properly earn her title as Glinda the Good. As the people celebrate and Glinda quietly mourns, Elphaba and Fiyero leave Oz ("Finale").

Note: "Wicked Witch of the East" is the only major piece to be omitted from the CD because the producers felt "the song included too much dialogue and would give some of the plot away to people who have not seen the show."''

==Music and recordings==

===Music analysis===
{{listen|filename=Wicked overture.ogg|title=The ''Wicked'' overture|description=The first 15 [[bar (music)|bars]] of the overture; note the identical chord progression to "As Long as You're Mine"}}
The score of ''Wicked'' is heavily [[theme (music)|thematic]], bearing in some senses more resemblance to a [[film score]] than a traditional musical score.&lt;ref name=musicalthemes/&gt; While many musical scores employ new motifs and melodies for each song with little overlap, Schwartz integrated a handful of [[leitmotif]]s throughout the production. Some of these motifs indicate irony&amp;nbsp;– for example, when Glinda presents Elphaba with a "ghastly" hat in "Dancing through Life", the score reprises a theme from "What is this Feeling?" a few scenes earlier,&lt;ref name=musicalthemes/&gt; in which Elphaba and Glinda had espoused their mutual loathing.

Two musical themes in ''Wicked'' run throughout the score. Although Schwartz rarely reuses motifs or melodies from earlier works,&lt;ref name="musicalthemes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-musical-themes.htm |title=Wicked – Musical Themes |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=MusicalSchwartz.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first&amp;nbsp;– Elphaba's theme&amp;nbsp;– came from ''[[The Survival of St. Joan]]'', on which he worked as [[musical director]].&lt;ref name=musicalthemes/&gt; "I always liked this tune a lot and I never could figure out what to do with it," he remarked in an interview in 2004.&lt;ref name=musicalthemes/&gt; The chord progression that he first penned in 1971 became a major theme of the show's orchestration. By changing the instruments that carry the motif in each instance, Schwartz enables the same melody to convey different moods. In the overture, the tune is carried by the orchestra's [[brass section]], with heavy percussion. The result is, in Schwartz' own words, "like a giant shadow terrorizing you".&lt;ref name=musicalthemes/&gt; When played by the piano with some electric bass in "As Long As You're Mine", however, the same chord progression becomes the basis for a romantic duet. And with new lyrics and an altered [[bridge (music)|bridge]], the theme forms the core of the song "No One Mourns the Wicked" and its reprises.&lt;ref name=musicalthemes/&gt;

Schwartz uses the "Unlimited" theme as the second major motif running through the score. Although not included as a titled song, the theme appears as an [[section (music)|interlude]] in several of the musical numbers. In a tribute to [[Harold Arlen]], who wrote the score for the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]], the "Unlimited" melody incorporates the first seven [[note (music)|notes]] of the song "[[Over the Rainbow]]." Schwartz included it as an inside joke as, "according to [[copyright law]], when you get to the eighth note, then people can come and say, 'Oh you stole our tune.' And of course obviously it's also disguised in that it's completely different rhythmically. And it's also harmonized completely differently.... It's over a different chord and so on, but still it's the first seven notes of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'".&lt;ref name=musicalthemes/&gt; Schwartz further obscured the motif's origin by setting it in a [[minor key]] in most instances. This also creates contrast in the songs in which it forms a part, for example in "Defying Gravity", which is written primarily in the key of [[D-flat major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/scorch.asp?ppn=SC0009049 |title=Defying Gravity |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=Musicnotes.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the song "The Wicked Witch of the East", however, when Elphaba finally uses her powers to let her sister walk, the "Unlimited" theme is played in a [[major key]].&lt;ref name=musicalthemes/&gt;

The Broadway production opened on October 30, 2003, to mixed to positive reviews from theatre critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorktheatreguide.com/reviews/wicked03.htm|title=Wicked reviews|accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=New York Theatre Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkinbroadway.com/world/Wicked.html|title=Wicked|accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=Talkin' Broadway}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chenoweth received nearly unanimous praise for her performances as Glinda while Menzel received mixed-to-positive reviews for her performance as Elphaba. Both ''USA Today'' and ''Time Magazine'' gave the Broadway production of ''Wicked'' very positive reviews, with Richard Zoglin of ''Time'' saying, "If every musical had a brain, a heart and the courage of ''Wicked'', Broadway really would be a magical place."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1006179,00.html|work=Time|title=Theater: Which Witch Was Wicked?|date=November 17, 2003|first=Richard|last=Zoglin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elysa Gardner of ''USA Today'' described it as "the most complete, and completely satisfying, new musical I've come across in a long time."&lt;ref name="Gardner_USAtoday_2003-10-30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/theater/2003-10-30-wicked_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Something 'Wicked' comes to Broadway|first=Elysa|last=Gardner|date=October 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Ben Brantley in the ''[[New York Times]]'' loved the production but panned the show itself, calling it a "sermon" that "so overplays its hand that it seriously dilutes its power," with a "generic" score. He noted that Glinda is such a showy role that the audience ends up rooting for her rather than the "surprisingly colorless" Elphaba, who is "nominally" the hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=990CE5DE103FF932A05753C1A9659C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22wicked%22%20%22Ben%20Brantley%22&amp;st=cse|work=New York Times|title=There's Trouble in Emerald City|date=October 31, 2003|first=Ben|last=Brantley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these mixed reviews, interest in ''Wicked'' spread quickly by word-of-mouth, leading to record-breaking success at the box office, as described below. Speaking to ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' in 2006, Schwartz commented, "What can I say? Reviews are reviews.... I know we divided the critics. We didn't divide the audience, and that's what counts."&lt;ref name="Gardner_USAtoday_2003-10-30" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arizonarepublic"&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]]|url=https://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/ae/articles/0820wicked0820history.html|accessdate=November 11, 2007|date=August 20, 2006|title=The little musical that could A critical flop, 'Wicked' sets box-office records|first=Kyle|last=Lawson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International productions have opened to similarly ambivalent critical reception. The West End production opened to a slightly more upbeat response. The majority of critics have appreciated the spectacle of the lavish production, and the "powerhouse" performances of actors in the roles of the two witches. However, contemporaries have characterized the production as overblown, occasionally preachy, and suffering from more hype than heart. Although Charles Spencer of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described it as "at times ... a bit of a mess," he praised Holzman's script, described Kenneth Posner's lighting design as "magical" and lauded Menzel's Elphaba and Helen Dallimore's Glinda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Charles|last=Spencer|title=Flawed, But Witches' Spell Still Works|date=September 28, 2006|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/09/28/btwicked28.xml|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=November 8, 2007|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Billington of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave it three out of five stars and remarked on the competence of all the lead actors; however, he complained that ''Wicked'' was "all too typical of the modern Broadway musical: efficient, knowing and highly professional but more like a piece of industrial product than something that genuinely touches the heart or mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Michael|last=Billington|title=Wicked: The Musical|date=September 28, 2006|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/critic/review/0,,1882699,00.html|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Taylor of ''The Independent'' gave extremely negative remarks to his viewing of the London production, calling the attempt at topical political allegory "well-meaning but also melodramatic, incoherent and dreadfully superficial" while deploring the acting, songs and book, concluding that "the production manages to feel at once overblown and empty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First Night: Wicked, Apollo Victoria, London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/first-night-wicked-apollo-victoria-london-417846.html|date=September 28, 2006|accessdate=August 24, 2011|first=Paul|last=Taylor|work=The Independent|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Behind the Emerald Curtain''===
The success of the Broadway production has led to the development of an auxiliary show, ''Behind the Emerald Curtain'', created by [[Sean McCourt]]—an original Broadway production cast member who played the Witch's Father, among other roles, in addition to understudying the Wizard and Doctor Dillamond, before taking over the latter principal role—and Anthony Galde, who was a long-running [[understudy|swing]] in the Broadway company from 2004 to 2012. The tour features a ninety-minute behind-the-scenes look at the props, masks, costumes and sets used in the show, and includes a question-and-answer session with the cast members. The Broadway tour is currently led by McCourt and long-running ensemble member and Glinda understudy Lindsay K. Northen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayinchicago.com/shows_dyn.php?cmd=display_current&amp;display_showtag=emeraldcurtain07 |title=Behind the Emerald Curtain |accessdate=January 11, 2008 |publisher=Broadway in Chicago |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121081050/http://www.broadwayinchicago.com/shows_dyn.php?cmd=display_current&amp;display_showtag=emeraldcurtain07 |archivedate=January 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour also featured in the Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago sit-down productions, and were each run by different long-serving cast members of the show. The tour provides a behind-the-scenes look at what goes into putting on the show every day. Participants get a first-hand account of what it is like to be a part of the massive production that ''Wicked'' is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emeraldcurtain.com/ |title=Behind the Emerald Curtain official website |accessdate=November 9, 2009|work=Behind the Emerald Curtain }}&lt;/ref&gt; To create Elphaba's green skin look, 40 pots a year of the commercially available MAC Chromacake landscape green make-up is used.

==In popular culture==
The success of ''Wicked'' has made several of the show's songs popular and has resulted in references to the show, characters, and songs in popular culture. The Broadway production has been featured in episodes of television programs, including ''[[Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series)|Brothers &amp; Sisters]]'' and ''[[The War at Home (TV series)|The War at Home]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Matriarchy|series=Brothers &amp; Sisters|serieslink=Brothers &amp; Sisters (2006 TV series)|airdate=2007-05-20|season=1|number=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For filming purposes, the Pantages Theatre in Los Angeles doubled for the Gershwin Theatre on Broadway in ''[[Ugly Betty]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=WICKED GETS UGLY |date=30 October 2007|url =https://www.londontheatredirect.com/news/185/WICKED-GETS-UGLY.aspx |work=London Theatre Direct |accessdate =August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an episode titled "[[Something Wicked This Way Comes (Ugly Betty)|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]" in which [[Betty Suarez|Betty]], the show's protagonist, goes to see ''Wicked'' on a date and accidentally stops the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title = Something Wicked This Way Comes |episodelink = Something Wicked This Way Comes (Ugly Betty) |series = Ugly Betty |serieslink = Ugly Betty |airdate = November 1, 2007 |season = 2 |number = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous episode "[[Brothers (Ugly Betty episode)|Brothers]]", Betty gets tickets to see ''Wicked'' and discusses with a friend how much she relates to Elphaba's outcast status in a popularity and beauty-oriented environment;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title = Brothers |episodelink = Brothers (Ugly Betty episode) |series = Ugly Betty |serieslink = Ugly Betty |airdate = February 8, 2007|season = 1 |number = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Donnie Fatso]]" sees [[Homer Simpson]] and [[Moe Szyslak]] accidentally sneak into a Springfield production of the show while the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[Broadway Bro Down]]" features ''Wicked'' and other musicals and have these shows contain [[subliminal stimuli|subliminal messaging]].

The television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' has featured covers of songs from ''Wicked'' four times: firstly in the "[[Wheels (Glee)|Wheels]]" episode where two students (Rachel and Kurt) compete for a lead solo, using the song "Defying Gravity"; secondly, in the episode "[[New York (Glee)|New York]]" where the same students duet on the Gershwin stage and sing "For Good"; in the series’ [[100 (Glee)|100th episode]], where three students sing "Defying Gravity" together; and in the series' penultimate episode, the same students sing "Popular". In the series ''[[New Girl (TV series)|New Girl]]'', a main character (Winston) sings the songs "Popular" and "Defying Gravity" on a trip to Mexico. A clip of the song "Popular" also plays in the 2009 movie ''[[Zombieland]]''.

Entertainer [[John Barrowman]] sang a version of "The Wizard and I" (retitled "The Doctor and I) on his 2008 tour of the UK, with adapted lyrics referring to his ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Torchwood]]'' character [[Jack Harkness|Jack]] showing affection for [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]]. [[Kerry Ellis]], who played Elphaba in the West End and on Broadway, recorded "I'm Not that Girl" for the fifth anniversary edition of the original Broadway cast recording. She also recorded her own rock version of "Defying Gravity". Both songs were produced by British musician [[Brian May]] and were featured on her extended play ''[[Wicked in Rock]]'' (2008) and debut album ''[[Anthems (Kerry Ellis album)|Anthems]]'' (2010). She performed her version of "Defying Gravity" at the 2008 ''[[Royal Variety Performance]]'',  alongside May on guitar. A dance remix of her rock version of "Defying Gravity" was later released in 2011. [[Louise Dearman]], who has played both Elphaba and Glinda in the West End, released an acoustic version of "Defying Gravity" for the ''Wicked'' edition of her album ''Here Comes the Sun''.

The cover art for the album was also bright green and included an Elphaba-style hat.

Media as diverse as the anime series ''[[Red Garden]]'', the daytime drama ''[[Passions]]'' and the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight|''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' graphic novels]] have all parodied ''Wicked''{{'s}} songs and characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title = At Every Window |episodelink = List of Red Garden episodes |series = Red Garden |serieslink = Red Garden |airdate = October 31, 2006|season = 1 |number = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference |writer=[[Joss Whedon|Whedon, Joss]] |penciller=Jeanty, Georges |inker=Owens, Andy |story=[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]] |title=[[The Long Way Home (Buffy comic)|The Long Way Home]] |volume=3 |issue=1 |date=May 21, 2007|publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the second of three episodes of the miniseries ''[[Tin Man (TV miniseries)|Tin Man]]'' (another adaptation of Baum's Ozian universe), protagonist DG refers to her father as "Popsicle" vice the more common names ‘Pop’ or ‘Pappi’, echoing Galinda in her letter home at the start of "What is this Feeling?".&lt;ref&gt;''Tin Man'' episode 2, December 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the second episode of the [[ABC Family]] drama series ''[[Huge (TV series)|Huge]]'', one of the characters wears a "Shiz University" athletic Dept T-shirt, while ''Wicked'' and its "long lines" have been mentioned in the Nickelodeon series ''[[iCarly]]''. The Broadway musical ''[[Shrek the Musical]]'' parodies the show's Act I finale with "What's Up, Duloc?"; character Lord Farquaad re-enacts "Defying Gravity" by proclaiming "No one's gonna bring me down" followed by the [[legato]] [[Belt (music)|belt]] while atop his castle.

The end of the song "Killer Instinct" in ''[[Bring It On the Musical]]'' parodies the closing notes of "No One Mourns the Wicked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzv2hOvUi6w|title=Killer Instinct Bring it on the Musical|date=September 30, 2012|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oscar-winning song "[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]" from the successful 2013 [[Disney]] film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', that also won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, had been compared to "Defying Gravity" due to its similar theme and similar singing style,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-26/entertainment/chi-frozen-1127-20131126_1_elsa-snow-queen-idina-menzel |title={{'}}Frozen{{'}}: Defying meteorology |accessdate=March 13, 2014 |work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was sung by the original Elphaba [[Idina Menzel]]. Willemijn Verkaik voiced the Dutch and German versions of the role of Elsa in ''Frozen'' and sang "Let It Go" in these two languages. This became another role originally played by Idina Menzel that Verkaik played, following her success in the German, Dutch and English language productions of ''Wicked''. When ''[[Frozen (musical)|Frozen]]'' came to Broadway, the song "Monster" (sung by Cassie Levy, who also played Elphaba) was compared to "No Good Deed"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yo1NT2j8Ybc&lt;/ref&gt;
