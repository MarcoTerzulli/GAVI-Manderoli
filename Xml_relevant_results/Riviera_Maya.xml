The '''Riviera Maya''' ({{IPA-es|ri'βjeɾa 'maʝa}}) is a [[tourism]] and [[resort]] district south of [[Cancun]], [[Mexico]]. It straddles the coastal [[Mexican Federal Highway 307|Federal Highway 307]], along the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coastline of the [[Mexican state|state]] of [[Quintana Roo]], located in the eastern portion of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. Historically, this district started at the city of [[Playa del Carmen]] and ended at the village of [[Tulum, Quintana Roo|Tulum]], although the towns of [[Puerto Morelos]], situated to the north of Playa del Carmen, as well as the town of [[Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo|Felipe Carrillo Puerto]], situated {{convert|40|km|mi}} to the south of Tulum, are both currently being promoted as part of the Riviera Maya tourist corridor.

The Riviera Maya was originally called the "'''Cancun–Tulum corridor'''", but in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gollan|first1=Doug|title=Riviera Maya's Tourism Growth Focuses On Luxury, Sustainability While Seeking To Improve Local Life|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/douggollan/2015/10/10/riviera-mayas-tourism-growth-focuses-on-luxury-sustainability-while-seeking-to-improve-local-life/#78d488da265a|accessdate=16 June 2017|work=[[Forbes]]|date=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was renamed as the Riviera Maya with the aid of [[Licentiate (degree)#Mexico|Lic.]] Miguel Ramón Martín Azueta. At the time, he was the [[municipal president]] of [[Solidaridad, Quintana Roo]]. The Riviera Maya includes the municipalities of Solidaridad in the north and Tulum in the south, and extends approximately {{convert|40|km}} inland, to the border with the state of [[Yucatán]].

==Tourism==
The Riviera Maya is famous for its large scale [[all-inclusive resort]]s and a historical tourism base of smaller boutique hotels as well as the many fine-dining restaurants available along the Fed 307 and on or near the beaches. Luxury travel entities have been instrumental in increasing luxury villa rentals and yacht charters in the area however these only represent a small fraction of the total tourism accommodation available.

Government development plans include establishing a number of medium-sized cities of ~200,000 inhabitants within the Riviera Maya with initial planning spanning 20 years. Target areas for urbanization include the towns and villages of: Puerto Morelos, the Riviera Maya), [[Puerto Aventuras]], [[Akumal]], Chemuyil, and [[Tulum, Quintana Roo|Tulum]].

A major attraction throughout the Riviera Maya are coastal and reef aquatic activities dependent on the coastal water and the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]] (also known as the [[Belize Barrier Reef]]) which begins near Cancun and continues along the whole length of the Riviera Maya continuing southward to Guatemala. This barrier reef system is the second longest in the world.

Activities at the most visited locations include [[Personal water craft|jet-skiing]], [[snorkeling]], [[scuba diving]], swimming in [[cenote]]s, [[swimming with dolphins]], [[Zip-line|zip-lining]], [[horse]] riding, sailing, and guided jungle tours. [[Archeology]] is also a big tourist draw in the area, including the popular archeological sites operated by the Instituto Nacional de Archeological such as [[Tulum]] on the coast, and [[Chichen Itza]] and [[Coba]] located some distance inland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Parker|first1=Matt|title=Mayan Ruins of Mexico|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/mayan-ruins-mexico-4203.html|accessdate=15 May 2017|publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The self-named ecoparks of [[Xcaret Park|Xcaret]] and [[Xel-Ha Park|Xel-Ha]] also include some smaller archeological ruins as part of their attractions, but these natural water theme parks operated by private business consortia attract much larger crowds due to the diversity and range of activities provided, such as swimming with captive dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Xcaret Eco Park - Nature Theme Park|url=https://www.locogringo.com/mexico/ways-to-play/riviera-maya/eco-adventure-parks/xcaret/|website=Loco Gringo|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Lisa|title=Our Top 5 Tips for Xcaret Park|url=https://www.playadelcarmen.com/blog/xcaret-park-top-5-tips|website=PlayadelCarmen.com|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The mean annual temperature is {{convert|24|-|25|C|F}}. The climate is dominated by a rainy season from May through November, and within the dry season there is a period dominated by northerly winds, called El Norte, which usually occurs in the months of January and February. The maximum mean annual precipitation throughout the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] occurs along the coast of the Riviera Maya with {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} of rainfall with a general decline to the NW with only {{convert|400|mm|ft}} per year or less on the opposite side of the Peninsula. While the Caribbean coast of the Yucatán experiences a large number of [[tropical storm]]s and [[hurricane]]s, the storm tracks and therefore landfalls of these are divergent to both the north (Cancun) and the south (south of Tulum and down to [[Belize]]) striking generally outside the Riviera Maya. Groundwater and therefore cenote water temperatures are {{convert|25|°C|°F}} year round. Coastal waters range from {{convert|26|°C|°F}} in January to {{convert|29|°C|°F}} in August.

==Geography==
[[File:Punta Maroma3.tif|right|thumb|[[Punta Maroma]], Riviera Maya, Mexico]]
The Riviera Maya is completely within the state of [[Quintana Roo]] on the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. The terrain is flat and covered by low tropical jungle. The geology is high purity carbonates down to a depth of 0.5 - 1.5&amp;nbsp;km below the surface. Mean annual rainfall is 1.5 m per year and the efficient infiltration results in the complete absence of any surface rivers. As is common in [[karst]], underground river networks have formed by dissolution, and these have been explored and mapped by [[cave diving]] through [[sinkhole]] collapses, locally called [[cenote]]s. The whole of the Yucatán Peninsula is underlain by a density-stratified coastal aquifer system with a lens-shaped freshwater body floating on top of intruding saline water. The formation of caves ([[speleogenesis]]) within this coastal carbonate aquifer is principally associated with carbonate dissolution at the fresh-saline water contact within the aquifer. By 2008, the Quintana Roo Speleological Society (QRSS) reported more than {{convert|700|km|mi}} of flooded [[cave]] passages within the limits of the Riviera Maya including the two longest underwater cave systems in the world of [[Sistema Sac Actun|Sac Actun]] and [[Sistema Ox Bel Ha|Ox Bel Ha]]. These groundwater resources, accessed via the thousands of cenotes throughout the landscape, once supported the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] civilizations and today remain the only natural sources of potable water in the area.

The Caribbean coastline is a series of crescent shaped white sand beaches interrupted every 1 – 10&amp;nbsp;km by rocky headlands and inlets, called [[wikt:caleta|caleta]]s, through which groundwater discharges into the coastal water. Large sections of the extensive [[mangrove]] swamps that lie behind the beaches and headlands are included in the areas scheduled for tourism development.

==Transportation==
Most tourists to the Riviera Maya arrive through [[Cancún International Airport]], approximately {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Playa del Carmen.

About {{Convert|20|km}} north of Tulum, a new international airport was announced. In March 2011, the bidding for construction contracts was to be concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avanza Tulum Hacia su Transformación: González Canto|url=http://www.qroo.gob.mx/Blog/blog1.php/2009/09/18/avanza-tulum-hacia-su-transformacion-gon|accessdate=16 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202075607/http://www.qroo.gob.mx/Blog/blog1.php/2009/09/18/avanza-tulum-hacia-su-transformacion-gon|archivedate=2 December 2009|language=Spanish|date=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2014, all projects related with the Tulum Airport are no longer available through official sites. The high speed trans-peninsula train is now the main project for the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cabrera|first1=Eduardo|title=Pone en marcha SCT proyecto de tren transpeninsular en Quintana Roo|url=http://www.imagenradio.com.mx/pone-en-marcha-sct-proyecto-de-tren-transpeninsular-en-quintana-roo|accessdate=16 June 2017|publisher=[[Imagen Radio]]|date=12 May 2012|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
