'''Hollywood Forever Cemetery''' is currently a full-service funeral home, [[crematorium|crematory]], and cultural art center which regularly hosts community events such as live music and summer movie screenings. It is one of the oldest [[cemeteries]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] and is located at 6000 [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles. It was founded in 1899 as '''Hollywood Cemetery''', and later known as '''Hollywood Memorial Park''' until 1998 when it was given its current name. The studios of [[Paramount Pictures]] are located at the south end of the same block, on {{convert|40|acre|ha}} that were once part of the cemetery but held no interments.

Individuals interred in the cemetery include many prominent people from the [[entertainment industry]], as well as people who played vital roles in shaping Los Angeles.

==History==
[[File:Hollywood Forever Cemetery Masonic Lodge interior.jpg|thumb|A [[Masonic lodge]] on the site is often used as a music venue]]
Hollywood's only cemetery,&lt;ref name="NYT1998/11/15"&gt;{{cite news| work=[[The New York Times]]| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/15/magazine/getting-in.html| title=Getting In| first=Amy M.| last= Spindler| date= November 15, 1998| accessdate=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood Forever was founded in 1899 on {{convert|100|acre|ha}} and called "Hollywood Cemetery" by F. W. Samuelson and (first name unknown) Lombard. In 1897, the two men were the owners of a {{convert|60|acre|ha}} tract of land near Hollywood in [[Los Angeles County]]. In that year, they—along with Mrs. M. W. Gardner of [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], Joseph D. Rodford, Gilbert Smith, and Thomas R. Wallace—formed a corporation known as the “Hollywood Cemetery Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lamag.com/culture/la_archetype/Story.aspx?id=1514671| title=Cemetery Historian| first=Lauren| last=Foliart| date=September 1, 2011| work=[[Los Angeles Magazine]]| accessdate=September 26, 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007122512/http://www.lamag.com/culture/la_archetype/Story.aspx?ID=1514671| archivedate=October 7, 2011| df=}}&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6AcLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=lombard+samuelson++%22hollywood+cemetery%22#v=onepage&amp;q=lombard+samuelson++%22hollywood+cemetery%22&amp;f=false|title=The Pacific Reporter|date=28 May 2017|publisher=West Publishing Company|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |title=Incorporated| quote=The Hollywood Cemetery Association filed articles of incorporation yesterday. |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 15, 1899 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery sold off large tracts to Paramount Pictures, which, with [[RKO Pictures]], bought {{convert|40|acre|ha}} by 1920. Part of the remaining land was set aside for the Beth Olam Cemetery, a dedicated [[Jewish cemetery|Jewish burial ground]] for members of the local Jewish community.

Jules Roth was a convicted [[Felony|felon]] and millionaire. In 1939, he bought a 51% stake in the cemetery, which was the interment site of his parents. He used the money from the cemetery's operations to pay for his personal luxuries.  At that time, the cemetery was known as Hollywood Memorial Park. In the 1990s, the cemetery began to show signs of neglect and disrepair.

Actress [[Hattie McDaniel]] was best known for her role as Mammy in the epic movie [[Gone with the Wind (film)|''Gone with the Wind'']], for which she became the first African American to win an [[Academy Award]]. She had expressed a desire to be interred at Hollywood Memorial Park. At the time of McDaniel's death in 1952, Hollywood Memorial, like other cemeteries, was [[Racial segregation|segregated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Actress Hattie McDaniel Gets Final Wish| url=http://archives.nbclearn.com/portal/site/k-12/flatview?cuecard=4706| work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]| publisher=nbclearn.com| date=October 27, 1999| first=Colleen| last=Dominguez}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite McDaniel's expressed wish, Roth would not allow the actress to be interred in the cemetery. Hollywood Forever would be desegregated seven years later. In 1999 (the 47th anniversary of McDaniel's death), the cemetery's current owner dedicated a [[cenotaph]] in her honor at a prime location south of Sylvan Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Price Davis| first=Anita| title=The Margaret Mitchell Encyclopedia| year=2013| publisher=McFarland| isbn=978-0786468553| page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1974, the [[cremation|crematory]] was shut down after singer [[Cass Elliot]] was cremated. According to cemetery grounds supervisor Daniel Ugarte, the crematory was in such disrepair that bricks began falling in around Elliot's remains. The crematory would be repaired and re-opened twenty-eight years later in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=LeDuff| first=Charlie| title=Comeback for Resting Place of Movie Stars| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/01/us/comeback-for-resting-place-of-movie-stars.html| work=Los Angeles Times| date=December 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, the California Cemetery Board began receiving regular complaints from the families of people interred there. Family members complained that the grounds were not kept up and were disturbed to hear stories about vandalism on the cemetery grounds. The heirs of well-known makeup artist [[Max Factor Sr.|Max Factor]] (who was interred in the Beth Olam Mausoleum in 1938) moved his and other Factor family remains to [[Hillside Memorial Park]] in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]] after the mausoleum sustained water damage that discolored the walls.

In 1986, a Los Angeles woman and 1,000 other plot owners filed a class action lawsuit against the cemetery for invasion of privacy after they discovered that Roth allowed employees of [[Paramount Pictures]] to park in the cemetery while the studio's parking structure was undergoing construction.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;{{cite web| last=Russell| first=Ron| title=Splendor Fades at Final Resting Place of Famous, Almost Famous| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-07-03/local/me-8717_1_final-resting-places| work=Los Angeles Times| date=1988-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, Jules Roth needed to settle tax bills and maintain his lavish lifestyle. He sold two lawns totalling {{convert|3|acre|m2}} that were facing the [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] front of the property. It was reported that the property was paid for with cash. Those lawns are now strip malls that house, among other businesses, an auto parts store and a laundromat.&lt;ref name="Tablet"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tabletmag.com/arts-and-culture/78893/burial-plots/| work=[[Tablet Magazine]]| title=Burial Plots| first=Jacob| last=Silverman| date=September 22, 2011| accessdate=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]], Roth could not afford to repair the roofs and other damage the earthquake caused to crypts. By that time, Hollywood Memorial was no longer making money and only generated revenue by charging families $500 for disinterments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Schiffman| first=Betsy| title=Grave Business| url=https://www.forbes.com/2002/11/01/cx_bs_1101homea.html| work=[[Forbes]]| date=November 11, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Roth became ill after he fell in his [[Hollywood Hills]] home. He had been embroiled in a scandal regarding another cemetery he owned, Lincoln Memorial Park, in [[Carson, California]]. Several months before his death, Roth was bedridden and disoriented and during this time his will was changed to provide for his business associates and maid, who were the only witnesses to his signature. His relatives, who were listed in his previous will, were written out. Roth died on January 4, 1998, and he was interred next to his wife, Virginia, his father, and his mother in the Cathedral Mausoleum.&lt;ref name="Tablet"/&gt; The state of California had revoked the cemetery's license to sell its remaining interment spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/11/us/los-angeles-journal-cemetery-to-the-stars-wins-a-court-reprieve.html| work=The New York Times| title=Los Angeles Journal; Cemetery to the Stars Wins a Court Reprieve| first=Todd S.| last=Purdum| date=December 11, 1997| accessdate=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Roth's death, the current owner discovered that the cemetery's endowment care fund—meant to care for the cemetery in perpetuity—was missing about $9&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="NYT1998/11/15"/&gt;  The owner also claimed that he discovered Mr. Roth's bust in an antique shop. The bust was part of Mr. Roth's personal artifacts that were sold at auction.

Those owners, Tyo, LLC, purchased the now {{convert|62|acre|ha|adj=on}} property that was on the verge of closure in a [[bankruptcy]] proceeding, in 1998 for $375,000. They renamed the cemetery "Hollywood Forever" and set out to give it a complete restoration,&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |first= Rebecca |last=Cathcart |title=Where Hollywood's Stars Are Interred, but Live Forever on Screen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/07/movies/07ceme.html?_r=1&amp;ref=movies&amp;oref=slogin |quote=In 1998 Tyler Cassity, a friend of Mr. Boileau's from St. Louis, bought the {{convert|62|acre|ha|adj=on}} property for $375,000 and began making renovations.

Since 2002, the cemetery has screened films on weekends during the summer and on holidays at a gathering called [[Cinespia]]. The screenings are held on the Douglas Fairbanks Lawn and the films are projected onto the white marble west wall of the Cathedral Mausoleum.&lt;ref name="LAT10Years"&gt;{{cite news| work=Los Angeles Times| url=http://www.latimes.com/theguide/events-and-festivals/la-et-guidefeature-20110812,0,3441270.story| title=Cinespia celebrates age 10 by staying up all night| first=Dima| last= Alzayat| date=August 12, 2011| accessdate=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Music events take place in the cemetery as well. On June 14 and 15, 2011, [[The Flaming Lips]] played at the cemetery in a two-night gig billed "Everyone You Know Someday Will Die," a lyric from their 2002 single "[[Do You Realize??]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/05/flaming-lips-hollywood-forever-cemetary-gigs-to-go-sale-this-friday.html| work=Los Angeles Times| title=Flaming Lips' Hollywood Forever Cemetery gigs go on sale Friday| date=May 3, 2011| first=Todd| last= Martens| accessdate=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cemetery contained a [[Confederate Monument (Hollywood Forever Cemetery)|Confederate Monument]], maintained by the [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] chapter of the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]] until Tuesday, August 15, 2017.&lt;ref name="latimesharveysoutherncaliforniadoesindeed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harvey|first1=Steve|title=Southern California does indeed have a Civil War history|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/29/local/la-me-0530-then-20100529|accessdate=July 11, 2017|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=May 29, 2010|quote=So will Hollywood Forever Cemetery, where the Long Beach chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy maintains a Confederate monument.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood Forever Cemetery removes Confederate monument after calls from activists and threats of vandalism|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-hollywood-forever-monument-20170815-story.html|accessdate=August 21, 2017|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=August 16, 2017|author=Tchekmedyian, Alene, Irfan Khan and Veronica Rocha }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 2013, electronic/industrial musician [[Gary Numan]] recorded a live album at the cemetery during his Splinter World Tour. It was released on February 19, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://open.spotify.com/album/2i9IOpLK1MTyJFnCI1qyf5?si=6GZXPHIR|title=Here in the Black – Live at Hollywood Forever Cemetery|date=19 February 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one scene of the novel ''[[Expiration Date (novel)|Expiration Date]]'' by [[Tim Powers]], the main characters are evading the antagonists of the novel by hiding in Hollywood Forever Cemetery. At one point the main hero, Pete Sullivan, remarks at the tomb of [[Bugsy Siegel]] that his late Hollywood producer father was friends with Siegel and many of the other celebrities interred at Hollywood Forever. To illustrate, Sullivan knocks the first few beats of "[[Shave and a Haircut|Shave-and-a-Haircut]]" on the marble slab of Siegel's crypt, and, a moment later, receives the response "Two-Bits" knocked from ''inside'' the crypt.
