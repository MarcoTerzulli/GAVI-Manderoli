{{Fascism in Romania}}

The '''Iron Guard''' ({{lang-ro|Garda de fier}} {{IPA-ro|ˈɡarda de ˈfjer|pron|Ro-Garda de Fier.ogg}}) is the name most commonly given to a [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Political movement|movement]] and [[political party]] in [[Romania]] founded in 1927 by [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] as the '''Legion of the Archangel Michael''' ({{lang|ro|Legiunea Arhanghelului Mihail}}) or the '''Legionnaire movement''' ({{lang|ro|Mișcarea Legionară}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Stanley G. |last=Payne |authorlink=Stanley G. Payne |title=A History of Fascism, 1914–1945 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=1995 |page=394}}&lt;/ref&gt; The League was [[Ultranationalism|ultra-nationalist]], [[antisemitism|antisemitic]], [[Anti-Hungarian sentiment|antimagyar]], [[Antiziganism|antiziganist]], [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] and promoted [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christianity]]. In March 1930 Codreanu formed the "Iron Guard" as a [[paramilitary]] political branch of the Legion, and in 1935, the Legion changed its official name to the "'''Totul pentru Țară'''" party (literally [["Everything For the Country" Party]]). It existed into the early part of [[World War II]]. Its members were called "Greenshirts" because of the predominantly green uniforms they wore.&lt;ref&gt;For "greenshirts" see, for example, R.G. Waldeck, ''Athene Palace'', University of Chicago Press eBook (2013), {{ISBN|022608647X}}, p. 182. Originally published 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Marshal [[Ion Antonescu]] came to power in September 1940, he brought the Iron Guard into the government, creating the [[National Legionary State]]. In January 1941, however, following the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionnaires' rebellion]], Antonescu used the army to suppress the movement, destroying the organization, but its then commander, [[Horia Sima]], and some other leaders escaped to Germany.

==Background==
Founded by [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] on 24 June 1927, as the "Legion of the [[Archangel Michael]]", and led by him until his assassination in 1938, followers of the movement continued to be widely referred to as "legionnaires" (sometimes "legionaries"; {{lang-ro|legionarii}}) and led to the organization of the "Legion" or the "Legionary Movement", despite various changes of the (intermittently banned) organization's name. In March 1930, Codreanu formed the "Iron Guard" ("Garda de Fier") as a [[paramilitary]] political branch of the Legion; this name eventually came to refer to the Legion itself.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/topic/Iron-Guard&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in June 1935, the Legion changed its official name to the "Totul pentru Țară" party, literally [["Everything For the Country" Party]], but commonly translated as "Everything for the Fatherland" or occasionally "Everything for the Motherland."&lt;ref&gt;"Totul pentru Țară" is translated as "Everything for the Fatherland" in "[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]" material that is now incorporated into "[[Encarta]]" as a sidebar ([http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_461500758/1938_Rumania.html 1938: Rumania] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwrXBk32?url=http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_461500758/1938_Rumania.html |date=2009-11-01 }}) and in the "[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]" article [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9042802 Iron Guard]; the [[International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania]] uses "Everything for the Motherland" in the English-language version of its November 11, 2004 [http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/presentations/programs/presentations/2005-03-10/pdf/english/chapter_03.pdf Final Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060129104944/http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/presentations/programs/presentations/2005-03-10/pdf/english/chapter_03.pdf |date=2006-01-29 }} ([[PDF]]). (All retrieved 6 Dec 2005.). &lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the League appears to have been inspired by the [[Black Hundreds]], an anti-semitic group in the [[Russian Empire]] (particularly the regions bordering Romania) who often used the name of the archangel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Seton-Watson]], ''The East European Revolution'', Methuen &amp; Co. London, 1950, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Founding and rise===
In 1927, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu left the number two position (under [[A.C. Cuza]]) in the Romanian political party known as the [[National-Christian Defense League]] (NCDL), and founded the Legion of the Archangel Michael.&lt;ref&gt;Ioanid, "The Sacralised Politics of the Romanian Iron Guard."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legion differed from other fascist movements in that it had its mass base among the peasantry and students, rather than among military veterans. However, the legionnaires shared the general fascist "respect for the war veterans". Romania had a very large ''intelligentsia'' relative to the general population with 2.0 university students per one thousand of the population compared to 1.7 per one thousand of the population in far wealthier Germany, while Bucharest had more lawyers in the 1930s than did the much larger city of Paris.&lt;ref name="Crampton, Richard page 115"&gt;Crampton, Richard ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century-And After'', London: Routledge, 1997 p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Even before the [[Great Depression]], Romanian universities were producing far more graduates than the number of available jobs and the Great Depression had further drastically limited the opportunities for employment by the ''intelligentsia'', who turned to the Iron Guard out of frustration.&lt;ref name="Crampton, Richard page 115"/&gt; Many Orthodox Romanians, having obtained a university degree, which they expected to be their ticket to the middle class, were enraged to find that the jobs they were hoping for did not exist, and came to embrace the Legion's message that it was the Jews who were blocking them from finding the middle-class employment they wanted.

Beyond that, Romania had traditionally been dominated by a Francophile elite, who preferred to speak French over Romanian in private and who claimed that their policies were leading Romania to the West with the National Liberal Party, in particular, maintaining that their economic policies were going to industrialize Romania.&lt;ref name="Crampton, Richard page 115"/&gt; The Great Depression seemed to show the literal bankruptcy of these policies and many of the younger Romanian ''intelligentsia'', especially university students, were attracted by the Iron Guard's glorification of "Romanian genius" and its leaders who boasted that they were proud to speak Romanian.&lt;ref name="Crampton, Richard page 115"/&gt; The Romanian-born Israeli historian [[Jean Ancel]] wrote from the mid-19th century onward, that Romanian ''intelligentsia'' had a "schizophrenic attitude towards the West and its values".&lt;ref name="Ancel pages 463"&gt;Ancel, Jean "Antonescu and the Jews", pp. 463–479, from ''The Holocaust and History The Known, the Unknown, the Disputed and the Reexamined'' edited by Michael Berenbaum and Abraham Peck, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1999, p. 463.&lt;/ref&gt;

Romania had been a strongly Francophile country starting in 1859 when the [[United Principalities]] came into being, giving Romania effective independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] (an event largely made possible by French diplomacy which pressured the Ottomans on behalf of the Romanians), and from that time onwards, most of the Romanian ''intelligentsia'' professed themselves believers in French ideas about the universal appeal of democracy, freedom and human rights, while at the same time holding [[antisemitic]] views about Romania's Jewish minority.&lt;ref name="Ancel pages 463"/&gt; Despite their antisemitism, most of the Romanian ''intelligentsia'' believed that France was not only Romania's "Latin sister", but also a "big Latin sister" that would guide its "little Latin sister" Romania along the correct path. Ancel wrote that Codreanu was the first significant Romanian to reject not only the prevailing Francophilia of the ''intelligentsia'', but also the entire framework of universal democratic values, which Codreanu claimed were "Jewish inventions" designed to destroy Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Ancel, Jean "Antonescu and the Jews" pp. 463–479 from ''The Holocaust and History The Known, the Unknown, the Disputed and the Reexamined'' edited by Michael Berenbaum and Abraham Peck, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1999 p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the traditional idea that Romania would follow the path of its "Latin sister" France, Codreanu promoted a xenophobic, exclusive ultra-nationalism, where Romania would follow its own path and rejected the French ideas about universal values and human rights.&lt;ref name="Crampton, Richard page 115"/&gt; In a marked departure from the traditional ideas held by the elite about making Romania into the modernized and Westernized "France of Eastern Europe", the Legion demanded a return to the traditional Eastern Orthodox values of the past and glorified Romania's peasant culture and folk customs as the living embodiment of "Romanian genius."&lt;ref name="Crampton, Richard page 115"/&gt;

The leaders of the Iron Guard often wore traditional peasant costumes with crucifixes and bags of Romanian soil around their necks to emphasise their commitment to authentic Romanian folk values, in marked contrast to Romania's Francophile elite who preferred to dress in the style of the latest fashions of Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, Richard ''Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century-And After'', London: Routledge, 1997 p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that many members of Romania's elite were often corrupt and that very little of the vast sums of money generated by Romania's oil found its way into the pockets of ordinary people, further enhanced the appeal of the Legion who denounced the entire elite as irredeemably corrupt.

With Codreanu as a charismatic leader, the Legion was known for skilful propaganda, including a very capable use of spectacle. Utilizing marches, religious processions, patriotic and partisan hymns and anthems, along with volunteer work and charitable campaigns in rural areas, in support of anti-communism, the League presented itself as an alternative to corrupt parties. Initially, the Iron Guard hoped to encompass any political faction, regardless of its position on the [[political spectrum]], that wished to combat the rise of [[communism]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]].

The Iron Guard was purposely anti-semitic, promoting the idea that "Rabbinical aggression against the Christian world" in "unexpected 'protean forms': [[Freemasonry]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freudianism]], [[homosexuality]], [[atheism]], [[Marxism]], [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevism]], and the  [[Spanish Civil War|civil war in Spain]]", were undermining society.&lt;ref&gt;Volovici, ''Nationalist Ideology'', p. 98, citing N. Crainic, ''Ortodoxie şi etnocraţie'', pp. 162–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Vaida-Voevod cabinet|Vaida-Voevod government]]{{Disputed inline|date=April 2019}} outlawed the Iron Guard in January 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Savu, pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=veiga191&gt;Veiga, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December 1933, the Romanian Liberal Prime Minister [[Ion Duca]] banned the Iron Guard. After a brief period of arrests, beatings, torture and even killings (twelve members of the Legionary Movement were murdered by the police force), Iron Guard members retaliated on 29 December 1933, by assassinating Duca on the platform of [[Sinaia]] railway station.

===Struggle for power===
[[File:Corneliu Zelea Codreanu.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], the founder of the Iron Guard]]

In the [[1937 Romanian general election|1937 parliamentary elections]] the Legion came in third with 15.5% of the vote, behind the [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal]] and the [[National Peasants' Party|National Peasant Parties]]. [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] strongly opposed the Legion's political aims and successfully kept them out of government until he himself was forced to abdicate in 1940. During this period, the Legion was generally on the receiving end of persecution. On 10 February 1938, the king dissolved the government and initiated a royal dictatorship. 

Codreanu advised the Legion to accept the new regime. However, Interior Minister [[Armand Călinescu]] did not trust Codreanu and ordered him arrested on 16 April. Realizing that the government was looking for an excuse to have him executed, Codreanu ordered the Legion's acting commander, [[Horia Sima]], to take no action unless there was evidence that he was in immediate danger. However, Sima, who was known for his violent streak, launched a wave of terrorist activity in autumn. Codreanu got wind of this and ordered the violence to end.&lt;ref name=Payne&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Fascism, 1914-1945|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|authorlink=Stanley G. Payne|publisher=[[Routledge]]|date=1996|isbn=0203501322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order came too late. On the night of 29-30 November 1938, Codreanu and several other legionnaires were strangled to death by their [[Jandarmeria Română|Gendarmerie]] escort on the night of 29–30 November 1938, purportedly during an attempt to escape from prison. It is generally agreed that there was no such escape attempt, and that Codreanu and the others were killed on the king's orders, probably in reaction to the 24 November 1938 murder by legionnaires of a relative (some sources say a "friend") of Călinescu. In the aftermath of Carol's decision to crush the Iron Guard, many members of the Legion fled into exile in Germany, where they received both material and financial support from the NSDAP, especially from the SS and [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s Foreign Political Office.&lt;ref name="Haynes pages 676-683"&gt;Haynes, Rebecca "German Historians and the Romanian National Legionary State 1940–41" pp. 676–683 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Volume 71, Issue # 4, October 1993 p. 681.&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of the interwar period, Romania was in the French sphere of influence, and in 1926 Romania signed a treaty of alliance with France. Following the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]] in March 1936, Carol started to move away from the traditional alliance with France as the fear grew within Romania that the French would do nothing in the event of German aggression in Eastern Europe, but Carol's regime was still regarded as essentially pro-French. From the German viewpoint, the Iron Guard was regarded as far preferable to King Carol. The royal dictatorship lasted just over one year. On 7 March 1939, a new government was formed with Călinescu as prime minister; on 21 September 1939, he, in turn was assassinated by legionnaires avenging Codreanu. Călinescu favored a foreign policy where Romania would maintain a pro-Allied neutrality in World War II, and as such, the SS had a hand in organizing Călinescu's assassination.&lt;ref name="Haynes pages 676-683"/&gt; Further rounds of mutual carnage ensued.

[[File:Corneliu Zelea Codreanu archive Legionary Movement Romanian Christian Nationalists.jpg|300px|thumb|left|[[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] and Iron Guard members in 1937]]

In addition to the conflict with the king, an internal battle for power ensued in the wake of Codreanu's death. Waves of repression almost completely eliminated the Legion's original leadership by 1939, promoting second-rank members to the forefront. According to a secret report filed by the Hungarian political secretary in Bucharest in late 1940, three main factions existed: the group gathered around Sima, a dynamic local leader from the Banat, which was the most pragmatic and least Orthodox in its orientation; the group composed of Codreanu's father, Ion Zelea Codreanu, and his brothers (who despised Sima); and the Moţa-Marin group, which wanted to strengthen the movement's religious character.

After a long period of confusion, Sima, representing the Legion's less radical wing, overcame all competition and assumed leadership, being recognised as such on 6 September 1940 by the Legionary Forum, a body created at his initiative. On 28 September the elder Codreanu stormed the Legion headquarters in Bucharest (the Green House) in an unsuccessful attempt to install himself as leader.&lt;ref&gt;Iordachi, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Sima was close to SS ''Volksgruppenführer'' Andreas Schmidt, a ''volksdeutsch'' (ethnic German) from Romania, and through him become close to Schmidt's father-in-law, the powerful [[Gottlob Berger]] who headed the SS Main Office in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Haynes pp. 676"&gt;Haynes, Rebecca "German Historians and the Romanian National Legionary State 1940-41" pp. 676–683 from ''The Slavonic and East European Review'' Volume 71, Issue # 4, October 1993 p. 681.&lt;/ref&gt; The British historian Rebecca Haynes has argued that financial and organizational support from the SS was an important factor in Sima's rise.&lt;ref name="Haynes pp. 676"/&gt;

===Sima's ascendancy===
{{See also|Horia Sima|Romania in World War II|Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom}}
In the first months of [[World War II]], Romania was officially neutral. However the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of 23 August 1939, initially a secret document, stipulated, among other things, Soviet "interest" in [[Bessarabia]]. After the [[invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] on 1 September, joined by the Soviet Union on 17 September, Romania granted refuge to members of Poland's [[Polish government-in-exile|fleeing government]] and [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|military]]. Even after the assassination of Călinescu on 21 September, King Carol tried to maintain neutrality, but the later surrender by France and Britain's retreat from Europe rendered them unable to fulfil their assurances to Romania. A lean toward the [[Axis powers]] was probably inevitable.

This political alignment was obviously favourable to the surviving legionnaires, and became even more so after France fell in May 1940. [[Horia Sima|Sima]] and several other legionnaires who had taken refuge in Germany began slipping back into Romania. A month after the fall of France, Carol restructured his regime's single party, the [[National Renaissance Front]], into the more overtly totalitarian "Party of the Nation," and invited a number of legionnaires to take part in the restructured government. On 4 July, Sima and two other leading legionnaires joined the government of [[Ion Gigurtu]]. However, they resigned after only a month due to mounting pressure for Carol to abdicate.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt;

The [[Second Vienna Award]], which forced Romania to cede much of northern [[Transylvania]] to Hungary, angered Romanians of all political shades and all but destroyed Carol politically. Despite this, a legionnaire coup on 3 September failed.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt;

===Electoral history===
At the [[1927 Romanian general election|1927]] and the [[1931 Romanian general election|1931 elections]] the movement stood for the [[Chamber of Deputies (Romania)|Chamber of Deputies]] as Legion of the Archangel Michael. In [[1932 Romanian general election|1932]] it stood as the Codreanu Group, winning five of the 387 seats. It did not contest the [[1928 Romanian general election|1928 election]] and was banned in [[1933 Romanian general election|1933]]. At the [[1937 Romanian general election|1937 election]] it stood as Everything for the Country Party, winning 66 of the 387 seats. At the [[1939 Romanian general election|1939 election]], all opposition parties were banned.

==In power==
More or less out of desperation, [[Carol II of Romania|King Carol II]] named General (later Marshal) [[Ion Antonescu]] as prime minister, partly because of the general's close ties with the Legion. Unknown to Carol, however, Antonescu had secretly reached an agreement with other political figures to force out the king.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; Amid popular outrage at the Second Vienna Award, Carol's position became untenable, and he was forced to abdicate in favour of his son [[Michael of Romania|Michael]], who quickly confirmed Antonescu's dictatorial powers and granted him the title of ''[[Conducător]]'' (leader) of Romania.

Although Antonescu was an archnationalist and authoritarian, his first preference was to form a government of national unity, in which all parties would have accepted him as dictator. However, with the exception of the Legion, the other parties at least wanted to maintain the appearance of parliamentary rule. The Legion, in contrast, fully supported Antonescu's vision of an ultranationalst and authoritarian regime. With this in mind, Antonescu formed an alliance with the Legion on 15 September. As part of the deal, Romania was proclaimed a "[[National Legionary State]]," with the Legion as the country's only legal party. Antonescu became the Legion's honorary leader. Sima became deputy premier, and four other legionnaires joined Sima in the cabinet.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt;

Once in power, from September 14, 1940 until January 21, 1941, the Legion ratcheted up the level of already harsh anti-Semitic legislation and pursued, with impunity, a campaign of pogroms and of political assassinations. On the 27th November 1940 more than 60 former dignitaries or officials were executed in [[Jilava]] prison while awaiting trial; historian and former prime minister [[Nicolae Iorga]] and economic theorist [[Virgil Madgearu]], also a former government minister, were assassinated the following day. Assassination attempts on the lives of former Prime Ministers and Carol supporters [[Constantin Argetoianu]], [[Guță Tătărescu]] and [[Ion Gigurtu]] were also carried out, but failed, as these politicians were freed from the hands of the Legionary police and put under military protection.

===Armaments===
As a paramilitary force, the Iron Guard had no shortage of firearms while it was in power. At the start of 1941, in Bucharest alone, the Legionnaires had 5,000 guns (rifles, revolvers and machine guns) as well as numerous hand grenades.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Robinson Luce, Time Inc., 1941, ''Time, Volume 37'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The Legion also possessed a small, mostly symbolic armored force of four vehicles: two police armored cars and two [[Renault UE Chenillette]]s from the [[Nicolae Malaxa|Malaxa]] factory.&lt;ref&gt;Auswärtiges Amt, H.M. Stationery Office, 1961, ''Documents on German Foreign Policy, 1918-1945: The aftermath of Munich, Oct. 1938-March 1939'', p. 1179&lt;/ref&gt; The Malaxa factory had been licence-producing these French armored vehicles since mid-1939,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Tarnstrom, Trogen Books, 1998, ''Balkan Battles'', p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;  and aside from the two such machines, the factory also supplied the Legion with machine guns and rifles.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Higham, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 1985, ''American Swastika'', p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; For transport, the Legion possessed almost 200 trucks in Bucharest alone.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Clark, Cornell University Press, 2015, ''Holy Legionary Youth: Fascist Activism in Interwar Romania'', p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure and destruction==
{{main|Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom}}
Once in power, Sima and Antonescu quarreled bitterly. According to historian [[Stanley G. Payne]], Antonescu intended to create a situation analogous to that of [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Francoist Spain|regime]] in [[Spain]], in which the Legion would be subordinated to the state. He demanded that Sima cede overall leadership of the Legion to him, but Sima refused.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt;

Sima demanded that the government follow the 'legionary spirit', and all major offices be held by legionaries. Other groups were to be dissolved. Economic policy, said Sima, should be coordinated closely with Germany.  Antonescu rejected Sima's demands and was alarmed by the Iron Guard's death squads. He decided to bide his time until he had a chance to destroy the Legion once and for all. On 14 January 1941, after securing approval in person from Hitler, and with support of the Romanian army and other political leaders, Antonescu moved in. The Guard started a last-ditch coup attempt but in a three-day civil war,  Antonescu won decisively with support from the Romanian and German armies.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Hitchins, ''Rumania, 1866–1947'' (1994) pp. 457–469&lt;/ref&gt; During the run-up to the coup attempt, different factions of the German government backed different sides in Romania with the SS supporting the Iron Guard while the military and the [[Federal Foreign Office|''Auswärtiges Amt'']] supported General Antonescu. Baron [[Otto von Bolschwing]] of the SS who was stationed at the German embassy in Bucharest played a major role in smuggling arms for the Iron Guard.&lt;ref name="Simpson, Christopher page 255"&gt;Simpson, Christopher ''Blowback America's Recruitment of Nazis and its Effects on the Cold War'', New York: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1988 p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt;

During the crisis members of the Iron Guard instigated a deadly pogrom in Bucharest. Particularly gruesome was the murder of dozens of Jewish civilians in the Bucharest slaughterhouse. The perpetrators hanged the Jews from meat hooks, then mutilated and killed them in a vicious parody of kosher slaughtering practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005472 ''Holocaust Encyclopedia''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,932546,00.html "New Order," Time magazine, Feb. 10, 1941].&lt;/ref&gt; The American ambassador to Romania Franklin Mott Gunther who toured the meat-packing plant where the Jews were slaughtered with the placards reading "Kosher meat" on them reported back to Washington: "Sixty Jewish corpses were discovered on the hooks used for carcasses. They were all skinned....and the quantity of blood about was evidence that they had been skinned alive".&lt;ref name="Simpson, Christopher page 255"/&gt; Gunther wrote he was especially shocked that one of the Jewish victims hanging on the meat hooks was a 5-year-old girl.&lt;ref name="Simpson, Christopher page 255"/&gt; Sima and other legionnaires were helped by the Germans to escape to Germany.

During the rebellion and pogrom, the Iron Guard killed 125 Jews, while 30 soldiers died in the confrontation with the rebels. Following it, the Iron Guard movement was banned and 9,000 of its members were imprisoned. On 22 June 1941, the Iron Guards imprisoned in Iași since January by the Antonescu regime were released from prison and organized and armed by the police as part of the preparations for the [[Iași pogrom]].&lt;ref&gt;Ioanid, Radu "The Holocaust in Romania: The Iasi Pogrom of June 1941" pp. 119–148 from ''Contemporary European History'', Volume 2, Issue # 2, July 1993 p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; When it came to killing Jews, the Antonescu regime and the Iron Guard were capable of finding common ground despite the failed coup in January 1941. When the pogrom began in Iași on 27 June 1941, the Iron Guards armed with crow-bars and knives played a prominent role in leading the mobs that slaughtered Jews on the streets of Iași in one of the bloodiest pogroms ever in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ioanid, Radu "The Holocaust in Romania: The Iasi Pogrom of June 1941" pp. 119–148 from ''Contemporary European History'', Volume 2, Issue # 2, July 1993 p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period between 1944–47 Romania had a coalition government in which the Communists played a leading, but not yet dominant role. Journalist [[Edward Behr (journalist)|Edward Behr]] claimed that in early 1947, a secret agreement was signed by the leaders of the exiled Iron Guard in displaced persons (DP) camps  in Germany and Austria and the Romanian Communist Party, under which the all of the Iron Guards in the DP camps except for those accused of the murder of Communists could return home to Romania in exchange for which the former Iron Guards would work as thugs to terrorize the anti-communist opposition as part of the plans for the ultimate Communist take-over of Romania.&lt;ref name="Behr, Edward page 111"&gt;Behr, Edward ''Kiss the Hand You Cannot Bite'', New York: Villard Books, 1991 p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Behr further claimed that in the months after the "non-aggression pact" between the Communists and the Legion, thousands of Iron Guards returned to Romania where they played a prominent role working for the Interior Ministry in breaking opposition to the emerging Communist dictatorship.&lt;ref name="Behr, Edward page 111"/&gt;

==Description==
===Ideology===
[[File:CorneliuZeleaCodreanuEnSello.jpg|thumb|1940 stamp bearing the symbol of the "Iron Guard" over a white cross that stood for one of its humanitarian ventures]]
Historian [[Stanley G. Payne]] writes in his study of Fascism, "The Legion was arguably the most unusual mass movement of interwar Europe."&lt;ref name="payne"&gt;Payne, Stanley G. (1995). ''A History of Fascism 1914–1945'' Madison: University of Wisconsin Press (pp. 277–289) {{ISBN|0-299-14874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Legion contrasted with most other European fascist movements of the period, especially when talking about its understanding of nationalism, which it believed should never be separated from the faith that people were born into. According to Ioanid, the Legion "willingly inserted strong elements of Orthodox Christianity into its political ideology to the point of becoming one of the rare modern European political movements with a religious ideological structure."

The movement's leader, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, was a religious patriot who aimed at a spiritual resurrection for the nation, writing the movement was a "spiritual school...[which] strikes to transform and revolutionise the Romanian soul."&lt;ref name=jstor/&gt;&lt;ref name="payne"/&gt; According to Codreanu's philosophy, human life was a sinful, violent political war, which would ultimately be transcended by the spiritual nation. In this schema, the Legionnaire might have to perform actions beyond the simple will to fight, suppressing the preserving instinct for the sake of the country.&lt;ref name="payne"/&gt;  Like many other fascist movements, the Legion called for a revolutionary "new man." However, this new man was very different in conception. The Legion didn't want a physical superhuman like the Nazis did. Instead, they wanted to recreate and purify the way of thinking in order to bring the whole nation closer to God.

One of the qualities of this new man was to be selflessness, Codreanu wrote "When a politician enters a party the first question that he puts is 'what can I gain from this?...when a legionary enters the Legion he says 'For myself I want nothing'".&lt;ref name=jstor/&gt;

As for economics, there was no straightforward program, but the Legion generally promoted the idea of a communal or national economy, rejecting [[capitalism]] as overly [[Economic materialism|materialistic]].&lt;ref name="payne"/&gt; The movement considered its main enemies to be the present political leadership and the Jews.

===Style===
Its members wore dark green uniforms (meant as a symbol of renewal, and the origin of the occasional reference to them as the "Greenshirts" – {{lang|ro|"Cămășile verzi"}}), and greeted each other using the [[Roman salute]]. The main symbol used by the Iron Guard was a triple [[cross]] (a variant of the triple parted and fretted one), standing for prison bars (as a badge of [[martyr]]dom), and sometimes referred to as the "Archangel Michael Cross" ({{lang|ro|"Crucea Arhanghelului Mihail"}}).

The mysticism of the Legion led to a cult of martyrdom and self-sacrifice. They had an action squad that was called ''Echipa morții'', or "Death Squad". Iron Guard leader Zelea Codreanu claimed the name was chosen because members were ready to accept death while campaigning for the organization. The members of the first "Death Squad" were: Ion Dumitrescu-Borșa (who was a Christian Orthodox priest), Sterie Ciumetti, Petre Țocu, Tache Savin, Traian Clime, Iosif Bozântan, Nicolae Constantinescu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Codreanu|first=Corneliu Zelea|title=Pentru legionari|trans-title=For the Legionaries|year=1936|url=ftp://ftp.hmr.ro/De_Citit/Pentru%20Legionari.pdf|authorlink=Corneliu Zelea Codreanu|accessdate=15 January 2013|language=Romanian|format=PDF|chapter=Echipa morții|trans-chapter=Death Squad}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A chapter of the Legion was called a ''cuib'', or "nest," and was arranged around the virtues of discipline, work, silence, education, mutual aid, and honor.

===The Iron Guard and gender===
According to a 1933 police report, 8% of the Iron Guard's members were women while a police report from 1938 stated that 11% of the Guards were women.&lt;ref&gt;Bucur, Maria "Romania" pp. 57–78 from ''Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945'' edited by Kevin Passmore, New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2003 p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reason for the overwhelming male membership of the Iron Guard was that a disproportionate number of legionnaires were university students and very few women went to university in Romania during the inter-war period.&lt;ref name="Bucur pages 57"&gt;Bucur, Maria "Romania" pp. 57–78 from ''Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945'' edited by Kevin Passmore, New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2003 p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Romanian language there are plurals attached to most nouns that have either a masculine or feminine form.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bucur, Maria "Romania", pp. 57–78, from ''Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945'' edited by Kevin Passmore, New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2003, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus words in English like "youth" or "member" that are gender-neutral are used in Romanian to refer either to Romanian men or Romanian women, young men or young women, and male members or female members.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Iron Guard almost always used the masculine plural forms in their writings and speeches, which may perhaps suggest that they had a male audience in mind, although in Romanian, like most languages, the masculine plural is also used for mixed-gender groups.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The Iron Guard explained that the problem of poverty in Romania was due to the Jews' ongoing colonization of Romania, and thereby prevented Christian Romanians from getting ahead economically.&lt;ref name="Bucur pages 57"/&gt; The solution to this perceived problem was to drive the Jews out of Romania, which the Iron Guard claimed would finally allow Eastern Orthodox Romanians to rise up to the middle class.

As to why Romania had been allegedly "colonized" by the Jews, the Iron Guard's answer was that most Romanian men were simply not manly enough to protect their interests.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Bucur, Maria "Romania" pp. 57–78 from ''Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945'' edited by Kevin Passmore, New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2003 p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; In strikingly sexualized language, the Iron Guards argued that most Romanian men had been "emasculated" and were suffering from "sterility", which one Iron Guard Alexandru Cantacuzino called the "plague of the present" in a 1937 essay.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Again, the term Cantacuzino used was the masculine ''sterilitate'' rather than the feminine ''stearpă''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Bucur, Maria "Romania" pp. 57–78 from ''Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945'' edited by Kevin Passmore, New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2003 pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;{{disputed inline|reason=This is wrong, because "sterilitate" is also a feminine noun.|date=April 2017}} The Iron Guards constantly spoke in viscerally sexualized rhetoric of the need to create a "new man" who would be "virile" and "strong", and end the "emasculation" of Romanian men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Beyond that, the Legion's obsession with violence and self-sacrifice were both subjects that were traditionally considered to be male subjects in Romania.

==Legacy==
The name ''"Garda de Fier"'' is also used by a small, Romanian nationalist group, active in the post-[[Communist Romania|communist era]].

There are also other contemporary far-right organizations in Romania, such as [[:ro:Pentru Patrie|Pentru Patrie]] (''For the Motherland'') and [[Noua Dreaptă]] (''The New Right''). Considering itself the heir of the Iron Guard's political philosophy, Noua Dreaptă embraces legionnairism and has a [[personality cult]] for [[Corneliu Codreanu]] but they also use the [[Celtic cross]], which is not associated with legionnairism.

===Legionary architecture===
Through their summer work camps, the Legionnaires performed volunteer work involving the construction and reparation of roads, bridges, churches and schools in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Keene, A&amp;C Black, 2007, ''Fighting For Franco: International Volunteers in Nationalist Spain During the Spanish Civil War'', p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diana Dumitru, Cambridge University Press, 2016, ''The State, Antisemitism, and Collaboration in the Holocaust: The Borderlands of Romania and the Soviet Union'', p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; One notable construction of the Iron Guard is the "Green House" (Romanian: ''Casa Verde''). Built in the Romanian architectural style, this building on the outskirts of 1930s Bucharest served as the Legion's headquarters and home to Codreanu.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Evola, Arktos, 2015, ''A Traditionalist Confronts Fascism'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miscarea.org/a/?p=677 Picture of the Green House]&lt;/ref&gt; The intention of these camps was to cultivate athleticism, discipline, sense of community and elimination of certain societal divisions. Horia Sima stated that the camps "destroyed class prejudice" by bringing together those from different classes. The attendees were not allowed to leave the camp except for emergencies and in their free time were to read literature. Following completion of camp time a diploma was received.&lt;ref name=jstor&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/20175210?read-now=1&amp;seq=7#page_scan_tab_contents&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public commemoration===
[[File:RO HD Deva Monumentul luptatorilor anticomunisti.jpg|thumb|The "Monument of the anti-Communist fighters" in Deva, commemorating a member of the Iron Guard (Ion Gavrilă Ogoranu)]]
[[File:Mircea Eliade (2474950873).jpg|thumb|A bust of Mircea Eliade]]
The Iron Guard is currently commemorated in Romania and elsewhere through permanent public displays (monuments and street names) as well as public distinctions (such as posthumous honorary citizenship) dedicated to some of its members. A few such examples are listed below:

*[[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], the leader of the Iron Guard, has a roadside cross a few miles from [[Bucharest]], near [[Buftea]]. It was built on the spot where he was executed in 1938. The site serves as a current destination for neo-Legionaries, who regularly gather there to commemorate Codreanu. Occasionally, members of right-wing extremist parties from outside Romania (such as Germany, Sweden and Italy) also attend these ceremonies. In 2012, the [[Elie Wiesel National Institute for Studying the Holocaust in Romania|Elie Wiesel Institute]] notified the Romanian general prosecutor about the monument, claiming that two symbols displayed at the site - the logo of the Iron Guard and a photograph of Codreanu - were illegal. The prosecutor decided that the memorial did not violate the law, because Codreanu had not been convicted for crimes against peace or crimes against humanity, and because the symbols displayed are not propaganda. Finally, the prosecutor referred to a legal exception which stated that the public use of such symbols is allowed if it serves an educational, academic or artistic purpose. However, the prosecutor also established that the flagpole and fence did not have a construction permit, so they were removed. The cross itself was left in its place.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandru Florian, Indiana University Press, 2018, ''Holocaust Public Memory in Postcommunist Romania'', pp. 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of State]], ''[https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/204540.pdf ROMANIA 2012 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZDSsA86W9g&amp;t=553s 2017 commemoration of Codreanu at his roadside memorial cross (YouTube)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Radu Gyr]] was a commander and ideologue of the Iron Guard who was convicted of war crimes. The Wiesel Institute requested the renaming of Radu Gyr Street in [[Cluj-Napoca]]. As of December 2017, the street had not been renamed.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of State]], ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20180421054247/https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/277453.pdf ROMANIA 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]'', p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Valeriu Gafencu]] was a Legionary who was active during the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionary Rebellion]]. He is now an honorary citizen of the town of [[Târgu Ocna]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexandru Florian, Indiana University Press, 2018, ''Holocaust Public Memory in Postcommunist Romania'', p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ion Gavrilă Ogoranu]] was one of the main leaders of the [[Romanian anti-communist resistance movement]], but prior to that he was a member of the Iron Guard. He now has a monument in his memory in [[Deva, Romania|Deva]], plus a foundation that bears his name. The neo-Legionary "Ion Gavrilă Ogoranu" Foundation is active in promoting the memory of the Iron Guard, such as when it organized a symposium dedicated to [[Gogu Puiu]], a prominent Iron Guard leader, in January 2016. A motion-picture about Ogoranu's life, ''[[Portrait of the Fighter as a Young Man]]'', was produced in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandru Florian, Indiana University Press, 2018, ''Holocaust Public Memory in Postcommunist Romania'', pp. 110, 115 and 175&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ion Moța]] and [[Vasile Marin]] were two Legionaries who were killed during the [[Spanish Civil War]] on 13 January 1937 while fighting on [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s side. At [[Majadahonda]], the site of their deaths, a monument was built in their honor.&lt;ref&gt;Romanian Cultural Foundation, 1994, ''Romanian Civilization, Volume 3'', p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Central European University, Jewish Studies Program, 2003, ''Jewish Studies at the Central European University: 2002-2003, Volume 3'', p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sf51e4G36Y&amp;t=1870s Ion Moța and Vasile Marin commemorated at Majadahonda, 13 January 2017 (YouTube)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mihail Manoilescu]] was an economist and politician, [[Governor of the National Bank of Romania]] between June and November 1931. In 1937, he joined the Iron Guard when he ran as a senator on the list of the ''Totul pentru Țară'', an organization established by the Iron Guard. He succeeded in becoming senator following the [[1937 Romanian general election|election]]. His views corresponded to a large extent with the ideology of the Iron Guard. In 1948, he was detained at the [[Sighet Prison]] where he died in 1950. He never faced trial, and thus he was never convicted.&lt;ref&gt;Wojciech Roszkowski, Jan Kofman, Routledge, 2016, ''Biographical Dictionary of Central and Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century'', p. 624&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 April 2016, the [[National Bank of Romania]] issued a set of commemorative coins in the honor of three former bank governors. Manoilescu, who led the bank for several months in 1931, was among them. Manoilescu's inclusion drew strong protests from the Wiesel Institute, on the grounds of Manoilescu's advocacy of Fascist ideology and antisemitism before World War II. In spite of the criticism, the Bank did not withdraw the coin.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Department of State]], ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20170307090344/https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/265676.pdf ROMANIA 2016 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/us-criticizes-romania-central-bank-for-anti-semitic-coin/ ''The Times of Israel'', US knocks Romania for ‘anti-Semitic’ coin]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Historian [[Mircea Eliade]] was perhaps the most well-known person to have been a member of the Iron Guard. As with Manoilescu, his membership was the result of his joining the ''Totul pentru Țară''.&lt;ref&gt;Horst Junginger, BRILL, 2008, ''The Study of Religion Under the Impact of Fascism'', pp. 36-37&lt;/ref&gt; Eliade is currently honored by various means, ranging from stamps to busts.

===Iron Guard in other countries===
The defunct American [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[Traditionalist Worker Party|Traditionalist Workers Party]] of the [[Nationalist Front (United States)|Nationalist Front]] took influence from Corneilu Zelia Codreanu for their ideology. The group's leader Matthew Heimbach (a [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] convert to [[Orthodox Christianity]]) was photographed wearing a T-shirt promoting Codreanu and the Iron Guard's Archangel Michael's Cross symbol in the aftermath of the August 2017 [[Unite the Right rally|Charlottesville riots]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} The Archangel Michael's Cross was among the symbols emblazoned on the firearms used by Brenton Tarrant during the 2019 [[Christchurch mosque shootings]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

During a 2018 interview with [[alt-right]] [[Mormonism|Mormon]] blogger Ayla Stewart, the Canadian [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] [[Faith Goldy|Faith J. Goldy]] recommended Codreanu's book ''For My Legionaries'' — which explicitly called for the extermination of the Jews — calling it "very, very, very, very spot on, given a lot of what the movement is talking about right now."&lt;ref name="PressProgress"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://pressprogress.ca/ex-rebel-media-host-promotes-1930s-book-by-fascist-author-advocating-the-elimination-of-jews |title=Ex-Rebel Media Host Promotes 1930s Book by Fascist Author Advocating 'The Elimination of Jews' |website=Press Progress |accessdate=2019-08-24 |date=2019-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; though later she said she no longer endorsed the book.&lt;ref name="PressProgress"/&gt;

The Iron Guard symbol was also spotted at [[Highlander Research and Education Center]] in [[New Market, Tennessee]] when the building was burned deliberately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/tennessee/2019/04/03/christchurch-shooter-used-racist-symbol-found-at-highland-center-fire/33746678002|title=White power symbol found at Highland Center fire used by Christchurch shooter|last=Dorman|first=Travis|work=Knoxville News Sentinel/USA Today|access-date=April 3, 2019|date=April 3, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;
