A '''layshaft''' is an intermediate [[Shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]] within a [[gearbox]] that carries [[gear]]s, but does not transfer the primary drive of the gearbox either in or out of the gearbox.&lt;ref name="Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car, Gearbox" &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Layshafts are best known through their use in car gearboxes, where they were a ubiquitous part of the rear-wheel drive layout. With the shift to front-wheel drive, the use of layshafts is now rarer.

The ''driving shaft'' carries the input power into the gearbox. The ''driven shaft'' is the output shaft from the gearbox. In car gearboxes with layshafts, these two shafts emerge from opposite ends of the gearbox, which is convenient for RWD cars but may be a disadvantage for other layouts.&lt;ref name="Setright, Indirect" /&gt;

For gearboxes in general, gear clusters{{efn-lr|Pairs or more of gears, connected together.}} mounted on a layshaft may either turn freely on a fixed shaft, or may be part of a shaft that then rotates in bearings. There may be multiple separate clusters on a shared shaft and these are allowed to turn freely relative to each other.{{efn-lr|Note that this is ''not'' the case where a single transmission path at multiple speeds, such as for car gearboxes, is needed. Car gearboxes use a layshaft with all its gears coupled together.}}

== Origins ==
The term ''layshaft'' originates with [[watermill]] machinery. The [[Glossary of mill machinery#layshaft|layshaft]] is the gear-carrying shaft that links the ''wallower'' (the small spur gear driven at increased speed by the [[waterwheel]]) to any ''upright shafts'' that carry the [[millstone]]s. The term, layshaft, was also used by [[millwright]]s, in both [[windmill|wind-]] and watermills, to refer to a shaft that drove secondary machinery such as sack hoists, rather than the main milling machinery.

The term ''layshaft'' was also applied to back-geared [[lathe (metal)#Types of metal lathes|lathe]]s. These were lathes with a slow-speed mechanism in addition to their usual belt drive. This used two gears on a layshaft behind the [[headstock]], giving a double reduction gear.

== Car manual transmissions ==
In the typical [[manual transmission|manual gearbox]] for a [[rear wheel drive|RWD]] car, the driving shaft (''input'') is in-line with the driven shaft (''output''), but not permanently connected to it. A [[reduction gear]] on the driving shaft drives the layshaft. In car transmissions, the term '''countershaft''' is also used.&lt;ref name="Hillier, layshaft" &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of gears on the layshaft may then be connected, one at a time, to the driven shaft. Selecting each of these gears in turn gives the various [[gear ratio|ratio]]s of the gearbox.&lt;ref name="Setright, Operation" &gt;{{harvnb|Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car| page=88–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these gear ratios are reduction gears, the engine speed being higher than the input speed to the [[final drive]] of the [[rear axle]].
 
Early gearboxes used sliding gears to engage and disengage the drive. These were difficult to operate and also wore on the main working surfaces of the gears. An early improvement was to use separate [[dog clutch]]es instead to engage gears, leaving the gears themselves in '[[constant mesh gearbox|constant mesh]]'. A later, and more gradual development, was the introduction of [[synchromesh]]. This is an all-metal friction clutch in addition to the positive dog clutch, that gradually engages the gears and matches their speed before the dog clutch engages.&lt;ref name="Setright, Synchromesh" &gt;{{harvnb|Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car| page=89–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The top gear of the gearbox is achieved without these gears, but by coupling the driven shaft directly to the driving shaft through another dog clutch. This gives a 'direct drive' top gear, which has advantages for both efficiency and quietness at cruising speed. A typical gearbox had 2% losses in each gear set, so 4% for intermediate ranges through their two gears, but approaching 0% for the direct-drive top gear.&lt;ref name="Setright, Indirect" /&gt; As the direct top gear is not transmitting torque through the gears, it is also quieter.

In theory, it is also possible to provide an [[overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] top gear, another indirect gear, but of a speed''-up'' ratio rather than the reduction ratio of the other gears. The direct-drive ratio then becomes the second-to-top or third gear. This arrangement was used on some early cars, but was uncommon.&lt;ref name="Setright, Indirect" /&gt; Where overdrive is provided for a RWD car, this is almost always done by adding a separate overdrive gearbox to the output driven shaft of the gearbox, usually outside the gear casing.&lt;ref name="Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car, Overdrive" &gt;{{Cite book

  |pages=93–95
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the layout of the gearbox, the layshaft is normally mounted low-down in the gearbox casing below the other shafts. The [[gear lever]] enters through the top of the casing and so it is more convenient for the sliding components of the dog clutches to be mounted on the driven shaft, rather than the layshaft. The layshaft gear cluster is thus often a simple one-piece component, typically cast iron gears running in bearings on a fixed steel shaft. The bearings may be plain phosphor bronze bushes, or for high-load applications [[needle roller]]s.&lt;ref name="Hillier, layshaft" /&gt;

Where large numbers of gear ratios, six or more, are to be provided then these will require a third or more gear clusters on the layshaft.{{efn-lr|As top gear is direct-drive, even five gears only require two clusters.}} To maintain the proportions of the overall gearbox as more compact, rather than becoming long and thin, these gearboxes may use twin layshafts. This requires an additional driven gear for each layshaft, but the mechanism is otherwise very similar.  The use of multiple layshafts also developed into the [[Preselector gearbox#Single ratio per clutch|multiple clutch gearbox]], used for some buses, where each ratio has its own layshaft and separate plate or hydraulic clutches, rather than dog clutches, are used to select between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a [[power take-off]] is required, usually for industrial vehicles to drive [[winch]]es, [[hydraulic pump]]s etc., this is often driven from one end of the layshaft, as this is more accessible shaft than the main shafts, already in use by the [[drivetrain]].

=== 'All-indirect' gearboxes  ===
[[File:Gearbox retouched.png|thumb|upright=0.6|left|Early, pre-1911, all-indirect gearbox]]
Some gearboxes do not use a layshaft, but rely on indirect gears throughout.&lt;ref name="Setright, Indirect" &gt;{{harvnb|Setright, Anatomy of the Motor Car| page=92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All-indirect were used for some very early cars, before the advantages of the direct-drive top gear were recognised. They contain no dog clutches; at the time, gear changing was still carried out by sliding the gears in and out of mesh. Once the dog clutch came into use, the further advantage of a direct-drive top gear was immediately recognised.

[[File:Manual Transmission for Volkswagen Golf.jpg|thumb|FWD all-indirect manual gearbox, with final drive taken from the second shaft]]
With the popularity of [[front-wheel drive]] from the 1960s, the all-indirect gearbox has become common. These have been used for both [[front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout#Front-engine transversely mounted / Front-wheel drive|transverse engine layout]]s, where the offset of two shafts is more convenient than the in-line arrangement of a layshaft gearbox,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hillier|1991| chapter=39: Constant-mesh and synchro-mesh gearbox |page=243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for longitudinal [[transaxle]] designs, such as the [[VW Beetle]] or many [[Renault]]s,{{efn-lr|Including the [[Renault 4]], [[Renault 5|5]], [[Renault 12|12]], [[Renault 16|16]], [[Renault 15/17|15/17]], [[Renault 25|25]] &amp; [[Renault 30|30]]}} where the requirement was to have both driven and driving shafts at the same end of the gearbox.

Although the loss of the direct-drive top ratio loses the ability for 0% losses when cruising, this is compensated for by reducing losses in other ratios from 4% to 2%.{{efn-lr|Through one gear pair rather than two.}}&lt;ref name="Setright, Indirect" /&gt; Noise is also reduced by modern [[metallurgy]] and [[gear cutting]], which give quieter and more efficient [[gear profile]]s.

As the gearbox efficiency remains constant for all ratios of an all-indirect gearbox, it is now convenient to provide overdrive top gears, even when these are no longer direct-drive or 1:1 ratios. One of the first mass-market cars to offer such a feature was the [[Volkswagen Polo Mk2|VW Polo]] and the ''Formel&amp;nbsp;E'', with a deliberately-labelled '-E' for 'economy' overdrive ratio.
