A '''Microsoft account''' or '''MSA'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2015/06/19/upcoming-changes-to-windows-10-insider-preview-builds/|title=Upcoming changes to Windows 10 Insider Preview builds [UPDATED 6/22]|website=Windows Experience Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (previously known as '''Microsoft Passport''',&lt;ref name="pressp"&gt;[https://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/1999/10-11passport.mspx Microsoft Passport: Streamlining Commerce and Communication on the Web]&lt;/ref&gt; '''.NET Passport''', '''Microsoft Passport Network''', and '''Windows Live ID''') is a [[single sign-on]] Microsoft [[user (computing)|user account]] for [[Microsoft]] customers to log into Microsoft [[website]]s (like [[Outlook.com]]), devices running on one of Microsoft's current [[operating system]]s (e.g. [[Windows 10]] computers and tablets, [[Windows Phone]]s, and [[Xbox]] consoles), and Microsoft [[application software]] (including [[Visual Studio]]).

==History==
Microsoft Passport, the predecessor to Windows Live ID, was originally positioned as a [[single sign-on]] service for all web commerce.  Microsoft Passport received much criticism.  A prominent critic was [[Kim Cameron (computer scientist)|Kim Cameron]], the author of ''The Laws of Identity,''&lt;ref name="LoI"&gt;{{cite web| last=Cameron| first=Kim | title =The Laws of Identity| work =[[Microsoft]]|date=May 2005| url =https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms996456.aspx/| accessdate =2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; who questioned Microsoft Passport in its violations of those laws.  He has since become Microsoft's Chief Identity Architect and helped address those violations in the design of the Windows Live ID identity meta-system.  As a consequence, Windows Live ID is not positioned as the single sign-on service for all web commerce, but as one choice of many among identity systems.

In December 1999, Microsoft neglected to pay their annual $35 "passport.com" domain registration fee to [[Network Solutions]]. The oversight made [[Hotmail]], which used the site for authentication, unavailable on December 24. A [[Linux]] consultant, Michael Chaney, paid it the next day ([[Christmas]]), hoping it would solve this issue with the downed site. The payment resulted in the site being available the next morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Chaney| first =Michael| title =The Passport Payment|date=2000-01-27| url =http://www.doublewide.net| accessdate =2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Autumn 2003, a similar [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|good Samaritan]] helped Microsoft when they missed payment on the "hotmail.co.uk" address, although no downtime resulted.&lt;ref name="UK"&gt;{{cite web| last=Richardson| first=Tim | title =Microsoft forgets to renew hotmail| work =[[The Register]]|date=2003-11-06| url =https://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/11/06/microsoft_forgets_to_renew_hotmail/| accessdate =2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]'s staff attorney Deborah Pierce criticized Microsoft Passport as a potential threat to privacy after it was revealed that Microsoft would have full access to and usage of customer information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com/Privacy+terms+revised+for+Microsoft+Passport/2100-1023_3-255310.html?tag=bplst Privacy terms revised for Microsoft Passport]&lt;/ref&gt; The privacy terms were quickly updated by Microsoft to allay customers' fears.

In July and August 2001, the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] and a coalition of fourteen leading consumer groups filed complaints&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epic.org/privacy/consumer/MS_complaint.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Federal Trade Commission (FTC)]] alleging that the Microsoft Passport system violated Section 5 of the [[Federal Trade Commission Act|Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA)]], which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices in trade.&lt;ref&gt;EPIC: Microsoft Passport Investigation Docket, http://epic.org/privacy/consumer/microsoft/passport.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Faisal Danka,&lt;ref&gt;[http://faisaldanka.wordpress.com Faisal Danka&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a British Indian IT Risk and Security executive, revealed a serious flaw in Microsoft Passport, through which any account linked to Microsoft Passport or Hotmail could easily be cracked by using any common browser.

Microsoft had pushed for non-Microsoft entities to create an Internet-wide unified-login system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com/Privacy+terms+revised+for+Microsoft+Passport/2100-1023_3-255310.html Microsoft had pushed for non-Microsoft entities]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of sites that used Microsoft Passport were [[eBay]] and [[Monster.com]], but in 2004 those agreements were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchenginejournal.com/microsoft-passport-dumped-by-ebay/1203/ Microsoft Passport Dumped By Ebay&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, Expedia sent notice out stating they no longer support Microsoft Passport / Windows Live ID.

In 2012, Windows Live ID was renamed Microsoft account.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/faq Windows 8 Consumer Preview - FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Microsoft account?|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/sign-in-what-is-microsoft-account|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2 August 2012|quote="Microsoft account" is the new name for what used to be called a "Windows Live ID."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Microsoft account allows users to sign into websites that support this service using a single set of credentials. Users' credentials are not checked by Microsoft account-enabled websites, but by a Microsoft account authentication server. A new user signing into a Microsoft account-enabled website is first redirected to the nearest authentication server, which asks for username and password over an [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] connection. The user may select to have their computer remember their login: a newly signed-in user has an encrypted time-limited cookie stored on their computer and receives a [[triple DES]] encrypted ID-tag that previously has been agreed upon between the authentication server and the Microsoft account-enabled website. This ID-tag is then sent to the website, upon which the website plants another encrypted HTTP cookie in the user's computer, also time-limited. As long as these cookies are valid, the user is not required to supply a username and password. If the user actively logs out of their Microsoft account, these cookies will be removed.

Microsoft account offers a user two different methods for creating an account:
#'''Use an existing e-mail address:''' Users are able to use their own valid e-mail address to sign up for a Microsoft account. The service turns the requesting user's e-mail address into a Microsoft account. Users may also choose a password of their own choice.
#'''Sign up for a Microsoft e-mail address:''' Users can also sign up for an e-mail account with Microsoft's webmail services designated domains (i.e. @hotmail.com, @live.com, @msn.com, @passport.com and @outlook.com or any variant for a specific country) that can be used as a Microsoft account to sign into other Microsoft account-enabled websites.

Microsoft websites, services, and apps such as [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]], [[MSN]] and [[Xbox Live]] use Microsoft account as a mean of identifying users. There are also several other companies that use it, such as the [[Hoyts]] website which is hosted by [[NineMSN]].

[[Windows XP]] and later has an option to link a Windows user account with a Microsoft account, thus automatically logging users in to their Microsoft account whenever a service is accessed. Starting with [[Windows Server 2012]], Windows allows users to directly authenticate into their PCs using their Microsoft account rather than a local or domain user.

===Profile===
A feature of the Microsoft account service is the profile manager, named Profile, which was formerly part of [[Windows Live]]. It displays information about the particular user, their recent activities, and their relationship with other Windows Live users. It also provides the ability to connect with others through [[Skype]], and via social networks such as [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]] and [[LinkedIn]].

Users can share some of their personal information such as interests and hobbies, and social information such as their favorites quote, hometown, or places lived previously. Profile also allows users to modify their privacy settings to decide what is shared.

===Web authentication===
On August 15, 2007, Microsoft released the Windows Live ID Web Authentication SDK, enabling web developers to integrate Windows Live ID into their websites running on a broad range of web server platforms - including [[ASP.NET]] ([[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]), [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]].&lt;ref&gt;LiveSide.net: [http://www.liveside.net/developer/archive/2007/08/16/windows-live-id-web-authentication-is-final.aspx Windows Live ID Web Authentication Is Final] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023055730/http://www.liveside.net/developer/archive/2007/08/16/windows-live-id-web-authentication-is-final.aspx |date=2008-10-23 }} 2007-07-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Live ID Team blog announcement: [http://winliveid.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!AEE1BB0D86E23AAC!908.entry Windows Live ID Web Authentication SDK for Developers Is Released] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807132226/http://winliveid.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!AEE1BB0D86E23AAC!908.entry |date=2010-08-07 }} 2007-07-15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support for OpenID===
On October 27, 2008, Microsoft announced that it was publicly committed to supporting the [[OpenID]] framework, with Windows Live ID becoming an OpenID provider.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.live.com/blogs/devlive/archive/2008/10/27/421.aspx Windows Live ID Becomes an OpenID Provider]&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow users to use their Windows Live ID to sign into any website that supports OpenID authentication.  There had been no update on Microsoft's planned implementation of OpenID since August 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.technet.com/b/privacyimperative/archive/2009/08/28/windows-live-id-openid-status-update.aspx Windows Live ID OpenID Status Update]&lt;/ref&gt; however since November 2013 Microsoft have publicly participated in OpenID Connect interoperability testing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thread-safe.com/2013/11/microsoft-publicly-participates-in.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/live/hh826544.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Login methods===
In addition to using an account password, users can login to their Microsoft account by accepting a mobile notification sent to a mobile device with [[Microsoft Authenticator]], a [[FIDO Alliance|FIDO]]2 [[security token]] or by using [[Windows Hello]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104376/microsoft-account-no-password-windows-hello-fido2-support|title=You can now sign into a Microsoft Account without a password using a security key|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=20 November 2018|work=[[The Verge]]|access-date=27 November 2018|publisher=[[Vox Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can also set up [[two-factor authentication]] by getting a [[Time-based One-time Password algorithm|time-based, single-use code]] by text, phone call or using an [[authenticator app]].

==Security vulnerabilities==
On June 17, 2007, Erik Duindam, a web developer in the Netherlands, reported a privacy and identity risk, saying a "critical error was made by Microsoft programmers that allows everyone to create an ID for virtually any e-mail address."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erikduindam.com/windowslive.pdf "Windows Live ID security breached" on erikduindam.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  A procedure was found to allow users to register invalid or currently used e-mail addresses. Upon registration with a valid e-mail address, an e-mail verification link was sent to the user. Before using it however, the user was allowed to change the e-mail address to one that did not exist, or to an e-mail address currently used by someone else. The verification link then caused the Windows Live ID system to confirm the account as having a verified email address. That flaw was fixed two days later, on June 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcworld.about.com/od/instantmessaging1/Microsoft-Windows-Live-Flaw-Op.htm Microsoft Windows Live Flaw Opened Door to Scammers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518185130/http://pcworld.about.com/od/instantmessaging1/Microsoft-Windows-Live-Flaw-Op.htm |date=2008-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 20, 2012, Microsoft fixed a flaw in Hotmail's password reset system that allowed anyone to reset the password of any Hotmail account. The company was notified of the flaw by researchers at Vulnerability Lab on the same day&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vulnerability-lab.com/get_content.php?id=529 Microsoft MSN Hotmail - Password Reset &amp; Setup Vulnerability]&lt;/ref&gt; and responded with a fix within hours — but not before widespread attacks as the exploitation technique spread quickly across the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/msftsecresponse/status/195568235654021121 Twitter / @msftsecresponse: On Friday we addressed a reset function incident to help protect Hotmail customers, no action needed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft patches major Hotmail 0-day flaw after apparently widespread exploitation |first=Peter |last=Bright |url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/04/microsoft-patches-major-hotmail-0-day-flaw-after-apparently-widespread-exploitation/ |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=April 27, 2012 |accessdate=October 21, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BZoWu9Os?url=http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/04/microsoft-patches-major-hotmail-0-day-flaw-after-apparently-widespread-exploitation/ |archivedate=October 21, 2012 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 2015, a security researcher discovered a vulnerability in the [[Adobe Marketing Cloud|Adobe Experience Manager]] (AEM) software used on signout.live.com and reported it to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). This vulnerability enabled full-administrative access to the AEM Publish nodes' [[OSGi]] console and made it possible to execute code inside of the [[JVM]] through the upload of a custom OSGi bundle. The vulnerability was confirmed to have been resolved on May 3, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kernelpicnic.net/2016/07/24/Microsoft-signout.live.com-Remote-Code-Execution-Write-Up.html "Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Microsoft's 'signout.live.com'"]&lt;/ref&gt;
