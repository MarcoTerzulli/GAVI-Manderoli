The '''Cross of Lorraine''' ({{lang-fr|Croix de Lorraine|link=no}}), known as '''Cross of Anjou''' in the 16th century, is a [[heraldry|heraldic]] [[two-barred cross]], consisting of a vertical line crossed by two shorter horizontal bars. In most renditions, the horizontal bars are "graded" with the upper bar being the shorter, though variations with the bars of equal length are also seen. The ''Lorraine'' name has come to signify several cross variations, including the [[patriarchal cross]] with its bars near the top.

== Design ==
The Cross of Lorraine consists of one vertical and two horizontal bars. In most renditions, the horizontal bars are "graded" with the upper bar being the shorter, though variations with the bars of equal length are also seen.

== History ==
The Cross of Lorraine came from the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] to the [[Duchy of Lorraine]].{{sfn|Monter|2007|p=23}} In Hungary, [[Béla III of Hungary|Béla III]] was the first monarch to use the two-barred cross as the symbol of royal power in the late 12th century.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=86}} He probably adopted it from the [[Byzantine Empire]], according to historian [[Pál Engel]].{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=86}}

[[René II, Duke of Lorraine]] inherited the two-barred cross as a symbol from his ancestors from the [[House of Valois-Anjou|House of Anjou]].{{sfn|Monter|2007|p=23}} His grandfather, [[René the Good]], who used it as his [[seal (emblem)|personal sigil]],{{sfn|McIntosh|2005|p=130}} laid claim to four kingdoms, including Hungary.{{sfn|Monter|2007|p=23}} The cross was still known as the "cross of Anjou" in the {{nobr|16th century}}.{{sfn|Carroll|2009|p=2}} René II placed the symbol on his flag before the [[Battle of Nancy]] in January 1477.{{sfn|Monter|2007|pp=22–23}} In the battle, René defeated the army of [[Charles the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], who had occupied the Duchy of Lorraine, and regained his duchy.{{sfn|Monter|2007|pp=21-22}} All coins struck for René bore the symbol thereafter.{{sfn|Monter|2007|p=23}}

== Symbol in France ==

[[Image:Flag of Free France (1940-1944).svg|thumb|right|200px|The flag of Free France is a regular [[flag of France]] that has been [[Lorraine (flag)|superimposed]] with the Lorraine cross.]]

The Cross of Lorraine is an emblem of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] in eastern France. Between 1871 and 1918 (and again between 1940 and 1944), the north-eastern quarter of Lorraine (the Moselle department) was annexed to Germany, along with [[Alsace]]. During that period the Cross served as a rallying point for French ambitions to recover its lost provinces. This historical significance lent it considerable weight as a symbol of French patriotism. During World War II, ''[[Capitaine de corvette]]'' [[Thierry d'Argenlieu]] suggested the Cross of Lorraine as the symbol of the Free French Forces led by [[Charles de Gaulle]] as an answer to the [[Nazi swastika]].

In France, the Cross of Lorraine was the symbol of [[Free France]] during World War II, the liberation of France from [[Nazi Germany]], and [[Gaullism]] and includes several variations of a [[two-barred cross]].

The Cross was displayed on the flags of Free French warships, and the fuselages of Free French aircraft. The medal of the [[Order of Liberation]] bears the Cross of Lorraine.

De Gaulle himself is memorialised by a {{convert|43|m|ft|adj=on}} high Cross of Lorraine in his home village of [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]]. The Cross of Lorraine was later adopted by Gaullist political groups such as the [[Rally for the Republic]].

== New World ==
French [[Jesuit]] missionaries and settlers to the New World carried the Cross of Lorraine c. 1750–1810. The symbol was said to have helped the missionaries to convert the native peoples they encountered, because the two-armed cross resembled existing local imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Gray 'The Museum Called Canada: 25 Rooms of Wonder' Random House, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

== European heraldry ==

The [[coat of arms of Hungary]] depicts a double cross, which is often attributed to [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]] influence as King [[Béla III of Hungary]] was raised in the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the 12th century, and it was during his rule when the double cross became a symbol of Hungary. Also the 'dual cross' is the consonant 'gy' in [[Old Hungarian script|ancient Hungarian runic writing]] which reads "egy" (one) when it stands alone mostly, if not always, with "God" meaning.

A golden double cross with equal bars, known as the Cross of Jagiellons, was used by [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] and [[King of Poland]] [[Jogaila]] since his conversion to Christianity in 1386, as a personal insignia and was introduced in the [[coat of arms of Lithuania]]. Initially, the lower bar of the cross was longer than the upper, since it originates from the Hungarian type of the double cross. It later became the symbol of [[Jagiellonian dynasty]] and is one of the [[national symbols of Lithuania]], featured in the [[Order of the Cross of Vytis]] and the badge of the [[Lithuanian Air Force]].

The double-barred cross is one of the national symbols in [[Belarus]], both as the Jagiellon Cross and as the [[Cross of Saint Euphrosyne|Cross of St. Euphrosyne of Polatsk]], an important religious artifact. The symbol is supposed to have [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] roots and is used by the [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church]] as a symbol uniting [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern-Byzantine]] and [[Latin Church|Western-Latin]] church traditions. The Belarusian Cross can be found on the traditional coat of arms of Belarus, the [[Pahonia]].

Silver double cross, on a mountain with three peaks, forms the coat of arms of [[Slovak Republic]]. It is considered national symbol of Slovaks, and its history in present territory can be traced back to [[Great Moravia]] in 9th century.

== Typography ==

The "Cross of Lorraine" symbol appears in [[Unicode]] as {{unichar|2628|CROSS OF LORRAINE|html=}}. It is not to be confused with {{unichar|2021|double dagger|html=}}.

The cross of Lorraine was previously used in the [[Sabre Travel Network|Sabre]], [[Apollo Reservation System|Apollo]], and [[Worldspan]] [[global distribution system]]s (GDS) as a [[delimiter]] in various input formats, however, the latest version of the [[graphical user interface]] for each system uses a different symbol: Apollo displays it as a [[plus sign]], Worldspan as a [[number sign]], and Sabre as a [[Japanese yen|yen]] symbol.

== Miscellaneous appearances ==

For its defense of France in World War I, the American [[79th Infantry Division (United States)|79th Infantry Division]] was nicknamed the "Cross of Lorraine" Division; its insignia is the cross. The German [[79th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|79th Infantry Division]] of World War II used the cross of Lorraine as its insignia because its first attack was in the Lorraine region. The insignia was redesignated effective December 1, 2009, for the 79th US Army Reserve Sustainment Support Command in Los Alamitos, California.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Catalog/HeraldryMulti.aspx?CategoryId=5752&amp;grp=2&amp;menu=Uniformed%20Services&lt;/ref&gt;

The cross is used as an emblem by the [[American Lung Association]] and related organizations through the world, and as such is familiar from their [[Christmas seal]]s program. Its use was suggested in 1902 by Paris physician Gilbert Sersiron as a symbol for the "crusade" against [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbalert.org/about/cross.php |publisher=[[TB Alert]] |title=The Cross of Lorraine – a symbol of the anti-TB "crusade" |accessdate=2006-11-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302074617/http://www.tbalert.org/about/cross.php |archivedate=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ab.lung.ca/about_us/cross_lorraine.php |title=History of the Double-Barred Cross|publisher=Alberta Lung Association|accessdate=2006-11-18 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080113123528/http://www.ab.lung.ca/about_us/cross_lorraine.php |archivedate = 2008-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cross was used in the TV show [[Magnum P.I.]] as the emblem on the ring worn by the members of Magnum's [[Vietnam War]] team who were the co-stars on the show. It was prominent in the 1st season's title sequence/intro.

The Scottish indie rock band [[Frightened Rabbit]] have used it as a symbol, notably on some merchandise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frightened Rabbit - Single juniors t-shirt|url=http://www.ebay.com/itm/frightened-rabbit-single-juniors-t-shirt-/200824573100|website=eBay|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their album ''[[The Winter of Mixed Drinks]]'', before switching to a three-barred [[papal cross]] for their EP ''[[State Hospital (EP)|State Hospital]]'' and their consecutive album ''[[Pedestrian Verse]]''.

It is a standard pattern for horse racing colours in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racing Colours|url=https://www.gibsonsaddlers.com/patterns/|website=gibsonsaddlers|accessdate=27 Oct 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[rock music]]ian [[Marilyn Manson]] released several "cryptic" videos that featured the Cross of Lorraine. The videos were posted to Manson's Instagram account in a series of five posts beginning on February 11, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Serio |first1=Alexandra |title=A Brief History of Marilyn Manson Pissing Off Jesus Christ |url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/ywzg7y/a-brief-history-of-marilyn-manson-pissing-off-jesus-christ |accessdate=20 July 2019 |publisher=Vice News |date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
