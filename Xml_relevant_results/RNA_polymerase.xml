'''RNA polymerase''' ('''ribonucleic acid polymerase'''), abbreviated  '''RNAP''' or  '''RNApol''', officially '''DNA-directed RNA polymerase''', is an [[enzyme]] that synthesizes RNA from a DNA template. RNAP [[helicase|locally opens]] the double-stranded [[DNA]] (usually about four turns of the double helix) so that one strand of the exposed [[nucleotide]]s can be used as a template for the synthesis of [[RNA]], a process called [[transcription (biology)|transcription]]. A [[transcription factor]] and its associated transcription [[mediator complex]] must be attached to a [[DNA binding site]] called a [[promoter region]] before RNAP can initiate the DNA unwinding at that position. RNAP not only initiates RNA transcription, it also guides the nucleotides into position, facilitates attachment and elongation, has intrinsic proofreading and replacement capabilities, and termination recognition capability. In [[eukaryote]]s, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides.

RNAP produces RNA that functionally is either [[Coding strand|coding]] (for protein) ([[messenger RNA]]) (mRNA); or [[non-coding]]: so-called "RNA genes". At least four functional types of RNA genes exist: 
# [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) — transfers specific [[amino acid]]s to growing [[polypeptide]] chains at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during [[translation (biology)|translation]];
# [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) — incorporates into [[ribosome]]s;
# [[micro RNA]] (miRNA) — regulates gene activity; and, 
# [[catalytic RNA]] ([[ribozyme]]) — functions as an enzymatically active RNA molecule.

RNA polymerase is essential to life, and is found in all living organisms and many viruses. Depending on the organism, a RNA polymerase can be a [[protein complex]] (multi-subunit RNAP) or only consist of one subunit (single-subunit RNAP, ssRNAP), each representing an independent lineage. The former is found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes alike, sharing a similar core structure and mechanism.&lt;ref name="pmid21233849"/&gt; The latter is found in phages as well as eukaryotic [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondria]], and is related to modern [[DNA polymerase]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid9419244"/&gt; Eukaryotic and archaeal RNAPs have more subunits than bacterial ones do, and are controlled differently.

Bacteria and archaea only have one RNA polymerase. Eukaryotes have multiple types of nuclear RNAP, each responsible for synthesis of a distinct subset of RNA. [[RNA polymerase I]] synthesizes a pre-[[rRNA]] 45[[Svedberg|S]] (35S in [[yeast]]), which matures and will form the major RNA sections of the ribosome. [[RNA polymerase II]] synthesizes precursors of mRNAs and most [[snRNA]] and microRNAs. [[RNA polymerase III]] synthesizes tRNAs, rRNA 5S and other [[small RNA]]s found in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[cytosol]]. [[RNA polymerase IV]] and [[RNA polymerase V|V]] found in plants are less-understood; they make [[Small interfering RNA|siRNA]]. In addition to the ssRNAPs, chloroplasts also encode and use a bacteria-like RNAP.

The 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] was awarded to [[Roger D. Kornberg]] for creating detailed molecular images of RNA polymerase during various stages of the transcription process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2006/index.html Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[prokaryote]]s, a single RNA polymerase species transcribes all types of RNA. RNA polymerase "core" from [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] consists of five subunits: two alpha (α) subunits of 36&amp;nbsp;[[kilodalton|kDa]], a beta (β) subunit of 150&amp;nbsp;kDa, a beta prime subunit (β′) of 155&amp;nbsp;kDa, and a small omega (ω) subunit. A sigma (σ) factor binds to the core, forming the holoenzyme. After transcription starts, the factor can unbind and let the core enzyme proceed with its work.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths AJF, Miller JH, Suzuki DT, et al. An Introduction to Genetic Analysis. 7th edition. New York: W. H. Freeman; 2000.

== Function ==
[[File:Transcription label en.jpg|thumb|An [[electron-micrograph]] of [[DNA|DNA strands]] decorated by hundreds of RNAP molecules too small to be resolved. Each RNAP is transcribing an [[RNA|RNA strand]], which can be seen branching off from the DNA. "Begin" indicates the [[3' end]] of the DNA, where RNAP initiates transcription; "End" indicates the [[5' end]], where the longer RNA molecules are completely transcribed.]]

Control of the process of [[gene]] transcription affects patterns of [[gene expression]] and, thereby, allows a [[cell (biology)|cell]] to adapt to a changing environment, perform specialized roles within an organism, and maintain basic metabolic processes necessary for survival. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that the activity of RNAP is long, complex, and highly regulated. In ''Escherichia coli'' bacteria, more than 100 [[transcription factor]]s have been identified, which modify the activity of RNAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishihama A | title = Functional modulation of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 54 | pages = 499–518 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11018136 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.54.1.499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNAP can initiate transcription at specific DNA sequences known as [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]s. It then produces an RNA chain, which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template DNA strand. The process of adding [[nucleotide]]s to the RNA strand is known as elongation; in eukaryotes, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million [[nucleotides]] (the full length of the [[dystrophin]] gene). RNAP will preferentially release its RNA transcript at specific DNA sequences encoded at the end of genes, which are known as [[Terminator (genetics)|terminators]].

Products of RNAP include:
*[[Messenger RNA]] (mRNA)—template for the [[Translation (biology)|synthesis of proteins]] by [[ribosome]]s.
*[[Non-coding RNA]] or "RNA genes"—a broad class of genes that encode RNA that is not translated into protein. The most prominent examples of RNA genes are [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) and [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA), both of which are involved in the process of [[Translation (genetics)|translation]]. However, since the late 1990s, many new RNA genes have been found, and thus RNA genes may play a much more significant role than previously thought.
**[[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA)—transfers specific [[amino acid]]s to growing [[polypeptide]] chains at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during [[translation (biology)|translation]]
**[[Ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA)—a component of ribosomes
**[[Micro RNA]]—regulates gene activity
**Catalytic RNA ([[Ribozyme]])—enzymatically active RNA molecules

RNAP accomplishes [[de novo synthesis|''de novo'' synthesis]]. It is able to do this because specific interactions with the initiating nucleotide hold RNAP rigidly in place, facilitating chemical attack on the incoming nucleotide. Such specific interactions explain why RNAP prefers to start transcripts with ATP (followed by GTP, UTP, and then CTP). In contrast to [[DNA polymerase]], RNAP includes [[helicase]] activity, therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind DNA.

==Action==
{{see also|Transcription (biology)#Major steps}}

=== Initiation ===
RNA polymerase binding in bacteria involves the [[sigma factor]] recognizing the core promoter region containing the −35 and −10 elements (located ''before'' the beginning of sequence to be transcribed) and also, at some promoters, the α subunit C-terminal domain recognizing promoter upstream elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{InterPro|IPR011260}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple interchangeable sigma factors, each of which recognizes a distinct set of promoters.  For example, in ''E. coli'', σ&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt; is expressed under normal conditions and recognizes promoters for genes required under normal conditions ("[[housekeeping gene]]s"), while σ&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; recognizes promoters for genes required at high temperatures ("[[heat shock protein|heat-shock genes]]"). In archaea and eukaryotes, the functions of the bacterial general transcription factor sigma are performed by multiple [[general transcription factor]]s that work together. The RNA polymerase-promoter closed complex is usually referred to as the "[[transcription preinitiation complex]]."&lt;ref name="Roeder1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roeder|first1=Robert G.|title=The complexities of eukaryotic transcription initiation: regulation of preinitiation complex assembly|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|volume=16|issue=11|year=1991|pages=402–408|issn=0968-0004|doi=10.1016/0968-0004(91)90164-Q|pmid=1776168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MBOG"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Watson JD, Baker TA, Bell SP, Gann AA, Levine M, Losick RM | title=Molecular Biology of the Gene | publisher=Pearson | edition=7th | year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After binding to the DNA, the RNA polymerase switches from a closed complex to an open complex.  This change involves the separation of the DNA strands to form an unwound section of DNA of approximately 13 bp, referred to as the "[[transcription bubble]]".  [[Supercoiling]] plays an important part in polymerase activity because of the unwinding and rewinding of DNA.  Because regions of DNA in front of RNAP are unwound, there are compensatory positive supercoils.  Regions behind RNAP are rewound and negative supercoils are present.&lt;ref name="MBOG"/&gt;

=== Promoter escape ===
RNA polymerase then starts to synthesize the initial DNA-RNA heteroduplex, with ribonucleotides base-paired to the template DNA strand according to Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions.  As noted above, RNA polymerase makes contacts with the promoter region. However these stabilizing contacts inhibit the enzyme's ability to access DNA further downstream and thus the synthesis of the full-length product. In order to continue RNA synthesis, RNA polymerase must escape the promoter. It must maintain promoter contacts while unwinding more downstream DNA for synthesis, [[DNA scrunching|"scrunching"]] more downstream DNA into the initiation complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Revyakin A, Liu C, Ebright RH, Strick TR | title = Abortive initiation and productive initiation by RNA polymerase involve DNA scrunching | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5802 | pages = 1139–43 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17110577 | pmc = 2754787 | doi = 10.1126/science.1131398 | bibcode = 2006Sci...314.1139R }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the promoter escape transition, RNA polymerase is considered a "stressed intermediate."  Thermodynamically the stress accumulates from the DNA-unwinding and DNA-compaction activities. Once the DNA-RNA heteroduplex is long enough (~10 bp), RNA polymerase releases its upstream contacts and effectively achieves the promoter escape transition into the elongation phase. The heteroduplex at the active center stabilizes the elongation complex.

However, promoter escape is not the only outcome. RNA polymerase can also relieve the stress by releasing its downstream contacts, arresting transcription.  The paused transcribing complex has two options: (1) release the nascent transcript and begin anew at the promoter or (2) reestablish a new 3'OH on the nascent transcript at the active site via RNA polymerase's catalytic activity and recommence DNA scrunching to achieve promoter escape. [[Abortive initiation]], the unproductive cycling of RNA polymerase before the promoter escape transition, results in short RNA fragments of around 9 bp in a process known as abortive transcription. The extent of abortive initiation depends on the presence of transcription factors and the strength of the promoter contacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldman SR, Ebright RH, Nickels BE | title = Direct detection of abortive RNA transcripts in vivo | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5929 | pages = 927–8 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19443781 | pmc = 2718712 | doi = 10.1126/science.1169237 | bibcode = 2009Sci...324..927G | authorlink2 = Richard H.

===Elongation===

The 17-bp transcriptional complex has an 8-bp DNA-RNA hybrid, that is, 8 base-pairs involve the RNA transcript bound to the DNA template strand.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}  As transcription progresses, ribonucleotides are added to the 3' end of the RNA transcript and the RNAP complex moves along the DNA. The characteristic elongation rates in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are about 10–100 nts/sec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://book.bionumbers.org/what-is-faster-transcription-or-translation/|title= Cell Biology by the Numbers: What is faster, transcription or translation?|website= book.bionumbers.org|first1= Ron|last1= Milo|first2= Rob|last2= Philips | name-list-format = vanc |access-date= 8 March 2017|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170420104945/http://book.bionumbers.org/what-is-faster-transcription-or-translation/|archive-date= 20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspartyl ([[Aspartic acid|asp]]) residues in the RNAP will hold on to Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, which will, in turn, coordinate the phosphates of the ribonucleotides.  The first Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; will hold on to the α-phosphate of the NTP to be added.  This allows the nucleophilic attack of the 3'OH from the RNA transcript, adding another NTP to the chain.  The second Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; will hold on to the pyrophosphate of the NTP.&lt;ref name="pmid22982365"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Svetlov V, Nudler E | title = Basic mechanism of transcription by RNA polymerase II | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1829 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–8 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 22982365 | pmc = 3545073 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbagrm.2012.08.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The overall reaction equation is:

:(NMP)&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + NTP → (NMP)&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; + PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;

====Fidelity====
Unlike the proofreading mechanisms of [[DNA polymerase]] those of RNAP have only recently been investigated. Proofreading begins with separation of the mis-incorporated nucleotide from the DNA template. This pauses transcription. The polymerase then backtracks by one position and cleaves the dinucleotide that contains the mismatched nucleotide. In the RNA polymerase this occurs at the same active site used for polymerization and is therefore markedly different from the DNA polymerase where proofreading occurs at a distinct nuclease active site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sydow JF, Cramer P | title = RNA polymerase fidelity and transcriptional proofreading | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 732–9 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19914059 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2009.10.009 | url = http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1940413/component/escidoc:1940417/1940413.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall error rate is around 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Philips |first1=Rob |last2=Milo |first2=Ron | name-list-format = vanc |title=What is the error rate in transcription and translation? |url=http://book.bionumbers.org/what-is-the-error-rate-in-transcription-and-translation/ |access-date=26 March 2019 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Termination===
{{main|Terminator (genetics)}}
In bacteria, termination of RNA transcription can be rho-dependent or rho-independent. The former relies on the [[rho factor]], which destablizes the DNA-RNA heteroduplex and causes RNA release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richardson JP | title = Rho-dependent termination and ATPases in transcript termination | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1577 | issue = 2 | pages = 251–260 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12213656 | doi = 10.1016/S0167-4781(02)00456-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter, also known as [[intrinsic termination]], relies on a palindromic region of DNA. Transcribing the region causes the formation of a "hairpin" structure from the RNA transcription looping and binding upon itself.  This hairpin structure is often rich in G-C base-pairs, making it more stable than the DNA-RNA hybrid itself.  As a result, the 8 bp DNA-RNA hybrid in the transcription complex shifts to a 4 bp hybrid.  These last 4 base pairs are weak A-U base pairs, and the entire RNA transcript will fall off the DNA.

Transcription termination in eukaryotes is less well understood than in bacteria, but involves cleavage of the new transcript followed by template-independent addition of adenines at its new 3' end, in a process called [[polyadenylation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lykke-Andersen S, Jensen TH | title = Overlapping pathways dictate termination of RNA polymerase II transcription | journal = Biochimie | volume = 89 | issue = 10 | pages = 1177–82 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17629387 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2007.05.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other organisms==
Given that DNA and RNA polymerases both carry out template-dependent nucleotide polymerization, it might be expected that the two types of enzymes would be structurally related. However, [[x-ray crystallography|x-ray crystallographic]] studies of both types of enzymes reveal that, other than containing a critical Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion at the catalytic site, they are virtually unrelated to each other; indeed template-dependent nucleotide polymerizing enzymes seem to have arisen independently twice during the early evolution of cells. One lineage led to the modern DNA polymerases and reverse transcriptases, as well as to a few single-subunit RNA polymerases (ssRNAP) from phages and organelles.&lt;ref name="pmid9419244"/&gt; The other multi-subunit RNAP lineage formed all of the modern cellular RNA polymerases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stiller JW, Duffield EC, Hall BD | title = Amitochondriate amoebae and the evolution of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 20 | pages = 11769–74 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9751740 | pmc = 21715 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.20.11769 | bibcode = 1998PNAS...9511769S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21233849"/&gt;

*β': The β' subunit is the largest subunit, and is encoded by the rpoC gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Monastyrskaya GS, Gubanov VV, Guryev SO, Salomatina IS, Shuvaeva TM, Lipkin VM, Sverdlov ED | title = The primary structure of E. coli RNA polymerase, Nucleotide sequence of the rpoC gene and amino acid sequence of the beta'-subunit | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 10 | issue = 13 | pages = 4035–44 | date = July 1982 | pmid = 6287430 | doi = 10.1093/nar/10.13.4035 | url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/13/4035 | pmc = 320776 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The β' subunit contains part of the active center responsible for RNA synthesis and contains some of the determinants for non-sequence-specific interactions with DNA and nascent RNA. It is split into two subunits in Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bergsland KJ, Haselkorn R | title = Evolutionary relationships among eubacteria, cyanobacteria, and chloroplasts: evidence from the rpoC1 gene of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 173 | issue = 11 | pages = 3446–55 | date = June 1991 | pmid = 1904436 | pmc = 207958 | doi = 10.1128/jb.173.11.3446-3455.1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*β: The β subunit is the second-largest subunit, and is encoded by the [[rpoB]] gene.  The β subunit contains the rest of the active center responsible for RNA synthesis and contains the rest of the determinants for non-sequence-specific interactions with DNA and nascent RNA.
*α: The α subunit is the third-largest subunit and is present in two copies per molecule of RNAP, α&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; and α&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt; (one and two). Each α subunit contains two domains: αNTD (N-Terminal domain) and αCTD (C-terminal domain). αNTD contains determinants for assembly of RNAP. αCTD (C-terminal domain) contains determinants for interaction with promoter DNA, making non-sequence-non-specific interactions at most promoters and sequence-specific interactions at upstream-element-containing promoters, and contains determinants for interactions with regulatory factors.
*ω: The ω subunit is the smallest subunit.  The ω subunit facilitates assembly of RNAP and stabilizes assembled RNAP.&lt;ref name=omid16908155&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mathew R, Chatterji D | title = The evolving story of the omega subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 14 | issue = 10 | pages = 450–5 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16908155 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2006.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to bind promoters, RNAP core associates with the transcription initiation factor [[sigma factor|sigma]] (σ) to form RNA polymerase holoenzyme. Sigma  reduces the affinity of RNAP for nonspecific DNA while increasing specificity for promoters, allowing transcription to initiate at correct sites. The complete holoenzyme therefore has 6 subunits: β'βα&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; and α&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;ωσ (~450 kDa).

===Eukaryotes===
[[Image:Alpha-Amanitin–RNA polymerase II complex 1K83.png|thumb|Structure of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (light blue) in complex with [[Alpha-Amanitin|α-amanitin]] (red), a strong poison found in [[Amanita phalloides|death cap mushrooms]] that targets this vital enzyme]]
[[Eukaryote]]s have multiple types of nuclear RNAP, each responsible for synthesis of a distinct subset of RNA.  All are structurally and mechanistically related to each other and to bacterial RNAP:
*[[RNA polymerase I]] synthesizes a pre-[[rRNA]] 45S (35S in yeast), which matures into 28S, 18S and 5.8S rRNAs, which will form the major RNA sections of the [[ribosome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Grummt I | title = Regulation of mammalian ribosomal gene transcription by RNA polymerase I | volume = 62 | pages = 109–54 | year = 1999 | pmid = 9932453 | doi = 10.1016/S0079-6603(08)60506-1 | isbn = 9780125400626 | series = Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[RNA polymerase II]] synthesizes precursors of [[mRNA]]s and most [[snRNA]] and [[microRNA]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal |author=Lee Y|author2=Kim M |author3=Han J |author4=Yeom KH |author5=Lee S |author6=Baek SH |author7= Kim VN. |title=MicroRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II|journal=EMBO J.| date=October 2004 |volume=23|issue=20|pages=4051–60|pmid=15372072 | doi = 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600385|pmc=524334}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the most studied type, and, due to the high level of control required over transcription, a range of [[transcription factor]]s are required for its binding to promoters.
*[[RNA polymerase III]] synthesizes [[tRNA]]s, [[rRNA]] 5S and other [[small RNA]]s found in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[cytosol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal |author=Willis IM.|title=RNA polymerase III. Genes, factors and transcriptional specificity|journal=Eur. J. Biochem.| date=February 1993 |volume=212|issue=1|pages=1–11|pmid=8444147 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17626.x  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[RNA polymerase IV]] synthesizes [[Small interfering RNA|siRNA]] in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herr AJ, Jensen MB, Dalmay T, Baulcombe DC | title = RNA polymerase IV directs silencing of endogenous DNA | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5718 | pages = 118–20 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15692015 | doi = 10.1126/science.1106910 | bibcode = 2005Sci...308..118H }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[RNA polymerase V]] synthesizes RNAs involved in [[siRNA]]-directed [[heterochromatin]] formation in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wierzbicki AT, Ream TS, Haag JR, Pikaard CS | title = RNA polymerase V transcription guides ARGONAUTE4 to chromatin | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 41 | issue = 5 | pages = 630–4 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19377477 | pmc = 2674513 | doi = 10.1038/ng.365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eukaryotic [[chloroplast]]s contain an RNAP very highly similar to bacterial RNAP ("plastid-encoded polymerase, PEP"). They use sigma factors encoded in the nuclear genome.&lt;ref name=pmid20701995&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schweer J, Türkeri H, Kolpack A, Link G | title = Role and regulation of plastid sigma factors and their functional interactors during chloroplast transcription - recent lessons from Arabidopsis thaliana | journal = European Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 89 | issue = 12 | pages = 940–6 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20701995 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejcb.2010.06.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chloroplast also contain a second, structurally and mechanistically unrelated, single-subunit RNAP ("nucleus-encoded polymerase, NEP"). Eukaryotic [[mitochondria]] use [[POLRMT]] (human), a nucleus-encoded single-subunit RNAP.&lt;ref name="pmid9419244"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cermakian N, Ikeda TM, Miramontes P, Lang BF, Gray MW, Cedergren R | title = On the evolution of the single-subunit RNA polymerases | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 45 | issue = 6 | pages = 671–81 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9419244 | doi = 10.1007/PL00006271 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13811504 | bibcode = 1997JMolE..45..671C | citeseerx = 10.1.1.520.3555 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such phage-like polymerases are referred to as RpoT in plants.&lt;ref name=pmid20701995/&gt;

===Archaea===
[[Archaea]] have a single type of RNAP, responsible for the synthesis of all RNA.  Archaeal RNAP is structurally and mechanistically similar to bacterial RNAP and eukaryotic nuclear RNAP I-V, and is especially closely structurally and mechanistically related to eukaryotic nuclear RNAP II.&lt;ref name="pmid19419240"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Korkhin Y, Unligil UM, Littlefield O, Nelson PJ, Stuart DI, Sigler PB, Bell SD, Abrescia NG | title = Evolution of complex RNA polymerases: the complete archaeal RNA polymerase structure | journal = PLOS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = e1000102 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19419240 | pmc = 2675907 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Werner F | title = Structure and function of archaeal RNA polymerases | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 65 | issue = 6 | pages = 1395–404 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17697097 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2007.05876.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The history of the discovery of the archaeal RNA polymerase is quite recent. The first analysis of the RNAP of an archaeon was performed in 1971, when the RNAP from the extreme [[halophile]] ''[[Halobacterium cutirubrum]]'' was isolated and purified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Louis BG, Fitt PS | title = Nucleic acid enzymology of extremely halophilic bacteria. Halobacterium cutirubrum deoxyribonucleic acid-dependent ribonucleic acid polymerase | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 121 | issue = 4 | pages = 621–7 | date = February 1971 | pmid = 4940048 | pmc = 1176638 | doi = 10.1042/bj1210621 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal structures of RNAPs from ''[[Sulfolobus solfataricus]]'' and ''[[Sulfolobus shibatae]]'' set the total number of identified archaeal subunits at thirteen.&lt;ref name="pmid19419240"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid18235446&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirata A, Klein BJ, Murakami KS | title = The X-ray crystal structure of RNA polymerase from Archaea | journal = Nature | volume = 451 | issue = 7180 | pages = 851–4 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18235446 | pmc = 2805805 | doi = 10.1038/nature06530 | bibcode = 2008Natur.451..851H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaea has the subunit corresponding to Eukaryotic Rpb1 split into two. There is no homolog to eukaryotic Rpb9 ([[POLR2I]]) in the ''S. shibatae'' complex, although TFS (TFIIS homolog) has been proposed as one based on similarity. There is an additional subunit dubbed Rpo13; together with Rpo5 it occupies a space filled by an insertion found in bacterial β' subunits (1,377–1,420 in ''Taq'').&lt;ref name="pmid19419240"/&gt; An earlier, lower-resolution study on ''S. solfataricus'' structure did not find Rpo13 and only assigned the space to Rpo5/Rpb5. Rpo3 is notable in that it's an [[Iron–sulfur protein#4Fe–4S clusters|iron–sulfur protein]]. RNAP I/III subunit AC40 found in some eukaryotes share similar sequences,&lt;ref name=pmid18235446/&gt; but does not bind iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fernández-Tornero C, Moreno-Morcillo M, Rashid UJ, Taylor NM, Ruiz FM, Gruene T, Legrand P, Steuerwald U, Müller CW | title = Crystal structure of the 14-subunit RNA polymerase I | journal = Nature | volume = 502 | issue = 7473 | pages = 644–9 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 24153184 | doi = 10.1038/nature12636 | bibcode = 2013Natur.502..644F}}&lt;/ref&gt; This domain, in either case, serves a structural function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jennings ME, Lessner FH, Karr EA, Lessner DJ | title = The [4Fe-4S] clusters of Rpo3 are key determinants in the post Rpo3/Rpo11 heterodimer formation of RNA polymerase in Methanosarcina acetivorans | journal = MicrobiologyOpen | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = e00399 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 27557794 | pmc = 5300874 | doi = 10.1002/mbo3.399 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeal RNAP subunit previously used an "RpoX" nomenclature where each subunit is assigned a letter in a way unrelated to any other systems.&lt;ref name="pmid21233849"/&gt; In 2009, a new nomenclature based on Eukaryotic Pol II subunit "Rpb" numbering was proposed.&lt;ref name="pmid19419240"/&gt;

[[Orthopoxvirus]]es and some other [[nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses]] synthesize RNA using a virally encoded multi-subunit RNAP. They are most similar to eukaryotic RNAPs, with some subunits minified or removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mirzakhanyan Y, Gershon PD | title = Multisubunit DNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases from Vaccinia Virus and Other Nucleocytoplasmic Large-DNA Viruses: Impressions from the Age of Structure | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 81 | issue = 3 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28701329 | pmc = 5584312 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.00010-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly which RNAP they are most similar to is a topic of debate.&lt;ref name=predate&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guglielmini|first=Julien|last2=Woo|first2=Anthony C.|last3=Krupovic|first3=Mart|last4=Forterre|first4=Patrick|last5=Gaia|first5=Morgan|date=2019-09-10|title=Diversification of giant and large eukaryotic dsDNA viruses predated the origin of modern eukaryotes|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=116|issue=39|pages=19585–19592|doi=10.1073/pnas.1912006116|pmid=31506349|pmc=6765235|issn=0027-8424}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most other viruses that synthesize RNA use unrelated mechanics.

Many viruses use a single-subunit DNA-dependent RNAP (ssRNAP) that is structurally and mechanistically related to the single-subunit RNAP of eukaryotic chloroplasts (RpoT) and mitochondria ([[POLRMT]]) and, more distantly, to [[DNA polymerase]]s and [[reverse transcriptase]]s. Perhaps the most widely studied such single-subunit RNAP is [[bacteriophage]] [[T7 RNA polymerase]]. ssRNAPs cannot proofread.&lt;ref name="pmid9419244"/&gt;

Other viruses use a [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase|RNA-dependent RNAP]] (an RNAP that employs RNA as a template instead of DNA). This occurs in [[Negative-sense ssRNA virus|negative strand RNA viruses]] and [[DsRNA virus#Group III - dsRNA viruses|dsRNA viruses]], both of which exist for a portion of their life cycle as double-stranded RNA.  However, some [[Positive-sense ssRNA virus|positive strand RNA viruses]], such as [[polio]]virus, also contain RNA-dependent RNAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ahlquist P | title = RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, viruses, and RNA silencing | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5571 | pages = 1270–3 | date = May 2002 | pmid = 12016304 | doi = 10.1126/science.1069132 | bibcode = 2002Sci...296.1270A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
RNAP was  discovered independently by Charles Loe, [[Audrey Stevens Niyogi|Audrey Stevens]], and [[Jerard Hurwitz]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hurwitz J | title = The discovery of RNA polymerase | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 280 | issue = 52 | pages = 42477–85 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16230341 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.X500006200 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, one half of  the 1959 [[Nobel Prize]] in Medicine had been awarded to [[Severo Ochoa]] for the discovery of what was believed to be RNAP,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1959/ Nobel Prize 1959]&lt;/ref&gt; but instead turned out to be [[polynucleotide phosphorylase]].

==Purification==
RNA polymerase can be isolated in the following ways:
*By a [[chromatography#Column chromatography|phosphocellulose column]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelly JL, Lehman IR | title = Yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase. Purification and properties of the catalytic subunit | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 261 | issue = 22 | pages = 10340–7 | date = August 1986 | pmid = 3525543 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*By [[glycerol gradient centrifugation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Honda A, Mukaigawa J, Yokoiyama A, Kato A, Ueda S, Nagata K, Krystal M, Nayak DP, Ishihama A | title = Purification and molecular structure of RNA polymerase from influenza virus A/PR8 | journal = Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 107 | issue = 4 | pages = 624–8 | date = April 1990 | pmid = 2358436 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a123097 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*By a [[DNA column]].
*By an [[ion chromatography]] column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hager DA, Jin DJ, Burgess RR | title = Use of Mono Q high-resolution ion-exchange chromatography to obtain highly pure and active Escherichia coli RNA polymerase | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 29 | issue = 34 | pages = 7890–4 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 2261443 | doi = 10.1021/bi00486a016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And also combinations of the above techniques.
