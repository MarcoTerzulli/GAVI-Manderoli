'''Queen Māyā of Sakya''' ({{lang-pi|Māyādevī}}) was the birth mother of [[Gautama Buddha]], the sage on whose teachings [[Buddhism]] was founded. She was sister of [[Mahapajapati Gotami|Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī]], the first Buddhist nun ordained by the Buddha.&lt;ref name=Shaw45&gt;'' Buddhist Goddesses of India by Miranda Shaw (Oct 16, 2006) {{ISBN|0-691-12758-1}} pages 45-46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EJT135&gt;''History of Buddhist Thought'' by E. J. Thomas (Dec 1, 2000) {{ISBN|81-206-1095-4}} pages&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhist tradition Maya died soon after the birth of Buddha, generally said to be seven days afterwards, and came to life again in a Buddhist heaven realm, a pattern that is said to be followed in the births of all Buddhas.&lt;ref name=Shaw45/&gt; Thus Maya did not raise her son who was instead raised by his maternal aunt [[Mahapajapati Gotami]].&lt;ref name=Shaw45/&gt; Maya would, however, on occasion descend from Heaven to give advice to her son.&lt;ref name=Shaw45/&gt;

''Māyā'' means "illusion" in [[Sanskrit]]. Māyā is also called ''Mahāmāyā'' ("Great Māyā") and ''Māyādevī'' ("Queen Māyā"). In [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] she is called ''Gyutrulma'' and in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is known as ''Maya-bunin'' (摩耶夫人). Also, in [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] she is known as ''මහාමායා දේවී'' (Mahāmāyā Dēvi).

==Iconography==
[[Image:SiddhartaBirth.jpg|thumb|The birth of Siddhārtha Gautama Buddha, Gandhara, 2nd–3rd century CE.]]

In Buddhist literature and art Queen Maya is portrayed as a beautiful fecund woman in the prime of life.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Her beauty sparkles like a nugget of pure gold. 
She has perfumed curls like the large black bee.
Eyes like lotus petals, teeth like stars in the heavens.
:— From the [[Lalitavistara Sūtra]]&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although sometimes shown in other scenes from her life, such as having a dream foretelling her pregnancy with [[Gautama Buddha]] or with her husband King [[Śuddhodana]] seeking prophecies about their son's life, shortly after his birth, she is most often depicted whilst giving birth to Gautama, an event that is generally accepted to have taken place in [[Lumbini]] in modern-day [[Terai]]. Maya is usually shown giving birth standing under a tree and reaching overhead to hold on to a branch for support. Buddhist scholar Miranda Shaw, states that Queen Maya's depiction in the nativity scene follows a pattern established in earlier Buddhist depictions of the tree spirits known as [[yaksini]].

==Life of Maya==
[[Image:MayaDream.jpg|thumb|Queen Māyā's white elephant dream, and the conception of the Buddha. [[Gandhara]], 2nd–3rd century CE.]]
[[File:Indian Museum Sculpture - Dream of Mayadevi, Mardan (9218153969).jpg|thumb|Dream of Mayadevi, [[Mardan]].]]

Māyā married King [[Suddhodana|Śuddhodana]] (Pāli: Suddhodana), the ruler of the [[Shakya|Śākya]] clan of [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilvastu]]. She was the daughter of King Śuddhodhana's uncle and therefore his cousin; her father was king of [[Devadaha]].

Māyā and King Suddhodhana did not have children for twenty years into their marriage. According to legend, one full moon night, sleeping in the palace, the queen had a vivid dream. She felt herself being carried away by four devas (spirits) to Lake Anotatta in the Himalayas. After bathing her in the lake, the devas clothed her in heavenly cloths, anointed her with perfumes, and bedecked her with divine flowers. Soon after a white elephant, holding a white lotus flower in its trunk, appeared and went round her three times, entering her womb through her right side. Finally the elephant disappeared and the queen awoke, knowing she had been delivered an important message, as the elephant is a symbol of greatness.

According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha-to-be was residing as a ''[[bodhisattva]]'' in the [[Tushita|{{IAST|Tuṣita}}]] heaven, and decided to take the shape of a white elephant to be reborn on Earth for the last time. Māyā gave birth to Siddharta c. 563 BCE. The pregnancy lasted ten lunar months. Following custom, the Queen returned to her own home for the birth. On the way, she stepped down from her [[palanquin]] to have a walk under the [[Sal tree]] (''Shorea robusta''), often confused with the [[Ashoka tree]] (''Saraca asoca''), in the beautiful flower garden of [[Lumbini]] Park, [[Lumbini Zone]], Nepal. Maya Devi was delighted by the park and gave birth standing while holding onto a sal branch. Legend has it that Prince Siddhārtha emerged from her right side. It was the eighth day of April. Some accounts say she gave him his first bath in the Puskarini pond in [[Lumbini Zone]]. But legend has it that [[deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s caused it to rain to wash the newborn baby. He was later named Siddhārtha, "He who has accomplished his goals" or "The accomplished goal".

Scholars generally agree that most Buddhist literature holds that Maya died seven days after the birth of Buddha, and was then reborn in the [[Tushita|Tusita]] Heaven. Seven years after the Buddha's enlightenment, she came down to visit [[Trāyastriṃśa|Tavatimsa]] Heaven, where the Buddha later preached the [[Abhidharma]] to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/maha/mahamaayaa.htm|title=Māyā|website=www.palikanon.com|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sister [[Mahapajapati Gotami|Prajāpatī]] (Pāli: Pajāpatī or Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī) became the child's foster mother.

After Siddhartha had attained [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|Enlightenment]] and become the Buddha, he visited his mother in heaven for three months to pay respects and to teach the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]].

==Cross-cultural analogies==
{{See also|Comparison of Buddhism and Christianity}}

Referring to the [[conception dreams|prophetic dream]] Queen Maya had prior to conception, the life story of the Buddha according to the Pali Canon say that his mother did not engage in sexual activity or entertain any thoughts of other men during her pregnancy. It does not say that Siddhartha was conceived without sexual activity between his parents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org www.accesstoinsight.org]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some parallels have been drawn with the birth story of [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Thundy95&gt;''Buddha and Christ'' by Zacharias P. Thundy (1993), {{ISBN|90-04-09741-4}}, pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

Z. P. Thundy has surveyed the similarities and differences between the birth stories of Buddha by Maya and Jesus by [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and notes that while there may have been similarities, there are also differences, e.g. that Mary outlives Jesus after raising him, but Maya dies soon after the birth of Buddha, as all mothers of Buddhas do in the Buddhist tradition.&lt;ref name=Thundy95/&gt; Thundy does not assert that there is any historical evidence that the Christian birth stories of Jesus were derived from the Buddhist traditions, but suggests that "maybe it is time that Christian scholars looked in the Buddhist tradition for the sources of the idea".&lt;ref name=Thundy95/&gt;

Other scholars have, however, rejected any influence, e.g. [[Paula Fredriksen]] states that no serious scholarly work places Jesus outside the backdrop of 1st century Palestinian Judaism.&lt;ref name=PaulaF26&gt;Fredriksen, Paula. ''From Jesus to Christ''. Yale University Press, 2000, p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Eddy and Boyd state that there is no evidence of a historical influence by outside sources on the authors of the New Testament, and most scholars agree that any such historical influence on Christianity is entirely implausible given that first century [[monotheistic]] [[Galilean]] Jews would not have been open to what they would have seen as pagan stories.&lt;ref name=Eddy53&gt;''The Jesus legend: a case for the historical reliability of the synoptic gospels'' by Paul R. Eddy, Gregory A. Boyd (2007), {{ISBN|0-8010-3114-1}}, pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt;
