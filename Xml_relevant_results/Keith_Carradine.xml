'''Keith Ian Carradine''' (born August 8, 1949) is an American actor, singer, and songwriter who has had success on stage, film, and television. He is known for his roles as Tom Frank in [[Robert Altman]]'s film ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'', [[Wild Bill Hickok]] in the [[HBO]] series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Frank Lundy in ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', and US President Conrad Dalton in ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]''. In addition, he is a [[Golden Globe]]– and [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]–winning songwriter. As a member of the [[Carradine family]], he is part of an acting [[dynasty]] that began with his father, [[John Carradine]].

==Early life==
Carradine was born in [[San Mateo, California]]. He is the son of actress and artist Sonia Sorel (née Henius), and actor [[John Carradine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/77/Keith-Carradine.html |title=Keith Carradine Biography (1949-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal half-brothers are [[Bruce Carradine|Bruce]] and [[David Carradine]], his maternal half-brother is [[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]], and his full brothers are [[Carradine family|Christopher]] and [[Robert Carradine]], all of whom are actors. His maternal great-grandfather was biochemist [[Max Henius]], and his maternal great-grandmother was the sister of historian [[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (historian)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_JEbAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=henry+henius+carradine |title=The National cyclopaedia of American biography |work=Google Books |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carradine's childhood was difficult. He said that his father drank and his mother "was a manic depressive paranoid schizophrenic catatonic—she had it all."&lt;ref name= Wadler&gt;{{cite news |first=Joyce |last=Wadler |title=Keith Carradine's Long Road to 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/theater/23wadl.html |work=The New York Times |date=July 23, 2006 |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were divorced in 1957, when he was eight years old.  A bitter custody battle led to his father gaining custody of him and his brothers, Christopher and Robert, after the children had spent three months in a home for abused children as wards of the court.  Keith said of the experience, "It was like being in jail. There were bars on the windows, and we were only allowed to see our parents through glass doors. It was very sad. We would stand there on either side of the glass door crying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Digby |last=Diehl |title=Getting Personal With Keith Carradine |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19841104&amp;id=0e4vAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=n_sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3804,1522465 |work=Boca Raton News |publisher=The Ledger |date=November 4, 1984 |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised primarily by his maternal grandmother, and he rarely saw either of his parents.&lt;ref name= Rader&gt;{{cite news |first=Dotson |last=Rader |title=I didn't want to fail |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&amp;dat=19910929&amp;id=qbEeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6s4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4980,3938857 |work=Parade Magazine |publisher=Spartanburg Herald-Journal |date=September 29, 1991 |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was not permitted to see him for eight years following the custody settlement.&lt;ref name= Wadler /&gt;

After high school, Carradine entertained the thought of becoming a [[forest ranger]] but opted to study drama at [[Colorado State University]]. He dropped out after one semester and drifted back to California, moving in with his older half-brother, David, who encouraged him to pursue an acting career, paid for his acting and vocal lessons, and helped him get an agent.&lt;ref name= Rader /&gt;

==Career==

===Stage===
As a youth, Carradine had opportunities to appear on stage with his father in the latter's productions of Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Thomas |title=John Carradine says, "I'll never quit!" |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eeweAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eSQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5630,2124268 |work=The Times-News |date=November 9, 1986 |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he had some background in theater when he was cast in the original Broadway run of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' (1969), which launched his acting career. In that production he started out in the chorus and worked his way up to the lead roles&lt;ref name="Takano"&gt;{{cite news |first=Hikari |last=Takano |title=David Carradine Interview |url=http://hikaritakano.co/index.php/audio-interviews/david-carradine |work=Hikaritakano.co |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; playing Woof and Claude. He said of his involvement in ''Hair'', "I really didn't plan to audition. I just went along with my brother, David, and his girlfriend at the time, [[Barbara Hershey]], and two of their friends. I was simply going to play the piano for them while they sang, but I'm the one the staff wound up getting interested in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julie |last=Cirelli-Heurich |title=Keith Carradine back on stage as a man of the theater |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/arts/index.ssf/2009/04/keith_carradine_back_on_the_st.html |work=New Jersey On-Line |date=April 9, 2009 |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His stage career is further distinguished by his [[Tony Award|Tony]]-nominated performance for Best Actor (Musical) as the title character in the Tony Award-winning musical, ''[[The Will Rogers Follies]]'' in 1991, for which he also received a Drama Desk nomination. He won the Outer Critics Circle Award for ''[[Foxfire (play)|Foxfire]]'' with [[Hume Cronyn]] and [[Jessica Tandy]], and appeared as Lawrence in ''[[Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (musical)|Dirty Rotten Scoundrels]]'' at the Imperial Theater. In 2008, he appeared as Dr. Farquhar [[Off-Broadway]] in ''Mindgame'', a thriller by Antony Horowitz, directed by [[Ken Russell]], who made his New York directorial debut with the production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindgametheplay.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013105124/http://www.mindgametheplay.com/ |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March and April 2013, he starred in the Broadway production of ''[[Hands on a Hardbody (musical)|Hands on a Hardbody]]''. He was nominated for the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for his work.

===Film===
Carradine's first notable film appearance was in director [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller]]'' (1971). His next film, ''[[Emperor of the North Pole]]'' (1973), was re-released with a shorter title ''[[Emperor of the North]].'' Carradine played a young aspiring hobo. The film was directed by [[Robert Aldrich]] and also starred [[Lee Marvin]] and [[Ernest Borgnine]]. Carradine then starred in Altman's film ''[[Thieves Like Us (film)|Thieves Like Us]]'' (1974), then played a principal character, a callow, womanizing folk singer, Tom Frank, in Altman's critically acclaimed film ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]''  (1975; see "Music and song writing"). He had difficulty shaking the image of Tom Frank following the popularity of the film. He felt the role gave him the reputation of being "a cad."&lt;ref name= Harris&gt;{{cite news |first=Art |last=Harris |title=Nashville Role Haunts Carradine |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19780430&amp;id=EWcaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PyoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5934,7226078 |work=The Milwaukee Journal |date=April 30, 1978 |accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 Aldrich said "I think that Keith Carradine, if he's careful—I don't think he is careful—and if he's prudent about the selection of his parts, can be a great big movie star. I think that whoever's advising him is making some terrible selections about material. Because I think the guy is gifted, he's talented, he's attractive."&lt;ref&gt;"I CAN'T GET JIMMY CARTER TO SEE MY MOVIE!"
Aldrich, Robert. Film Comment; New York Vol. 13, Iss. 2,  (Mar/Apr 1977): 46-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Carradine starred opposite [[Harvey Keitel]] in [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[The Duellists]]''. ''[[Pretty Baby (1978 film)|Pretty Baby]]'' followed in 1978. He has acted in several offbeat films of Altman's protege [[Alan Rudolph]], playing a disarmingly candid madman in ''[[Choose Me]]'' (1984), an incompetent petty criminal in ''[[Trouble in Mind (film)|Trouble in Mind]]'' (1985), and an American artist in 1930s Paris in ''[[The Moderns]]'' (1988).

He appeared with brothers David and Robert as the [[James-Younger gang|Younger brothers]] in [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s film ''[[The Long Riders]]'' (1980). Keith played [[Jim Younger]] in that film. In 1981, he appeared again under Hill's direction in ''[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]].'' In 1994, he had a [[cameo role]] as [[Will Rogers]] in Rudolph's film about [[Dorothy Parker]], ''[[Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle]]''. He co-starred with [[Daryl Hannah]] as homicidal sociopath John Netherwood in the thriller ''[[The Tie That Binds (1995 film)|The Tie That Binds]]'' (1995). In 2011, he starred in ''[[Cowboys &amp; Aliens|Cowboys and Aliens]]'', an American [[Science fiction Western|science fiction western]] film directed by [[Jon Favreau]] also starring [[Daniel Craig]], [[Harrison Ford]], and [[Olivia Wilde]]. Carradine traveled to [[Tuscany]] in 2012 to executive produce and star in [[John Jopson]]'s [[Edgar Allan Poe]] inspired film ''[[Terroir (film)|Terroir]]''. In 2013, he starred in ''[[Ain't Them Bodies Saints]]'', which won the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival]] award for [[cinematography]]. In 2016 Keith played [[Edward Dickinson]], father of [[Emily Dickinson]], in ''[[A Quiet Passion]]'', a biographical film directed and written by [[Terence Davies]] about the life of the American poet.

In 2016 Carradine returned to star in his fourth [[Alan Rudolph]] film ''[[Ray Meets Helen]]'' alongside actress [[Sondra Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/lesley-ann-warren-keith-carradine-ray-meets-helen-1201689193|title=Lesley Ann Warren, Keith Carradine Starring in 'Ray Meets Helen'|work=Variety|accessdate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music and song writing===
His brother, David, said in an interview that Keith could play any instrument he wanted, including [[bagpipes]] and the [[French horn]].&lt;ref name="Takano" /&gt; Like David, Keith integrated his musical talents with his acting performances. In 1975, he performed a song he had written, [[I'm Easy (Keith Carradine song)|"I'm Easy"]], in the movie ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]''. It was a popular hit, and Carradine won a Golden Globe and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Song|Best Original Song]] for the tune. This led to a brief singing career; he signed a contract with [[Asylum Records]] and released two albums – ''[[I'm Easy (album)|I'm Easy]]'' (1976) and ''Lost &amp; Found'' (1978). In 1984, he appeared in the music video for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s single "[[Material Girl]]". In the early 1990s, he played the lead role in the [[Tony Award]]-winning musical ''[[The Will Rogers Follies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1993-01-03-9301010567-story.html |title=Keith Carradine's Follies |last=Zink |first=Jack |publisher=Sun Sentinel |date=January 3, 1993 |website=sun-sentinel.com |access-date=March 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other TV appearances include ''My Father My Son'' (1988), a television film. In 1983, he appeared as Foxy Funderburke, a murderous pedophile, in the television miniseries ''[[Chiefs (TV miniseries)|Chiefs]]'', based on the [[Stuart Woods]] [[Chiefs (novel)|novel of the same name]]. His performance in ''Chiefs'' earned him a nomination for an [[Emmy Award]] in the "Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or a Special" category.&lt;ref name="Emmy"&gt;{{IMDb title|84997|section=awards|Chiefs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carradine also starred in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Complete Savages]]'', and he played [[Wild Bill Hickok]] in the HBO series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]''.

He met his daughter, [[Martha Plimpton]], when she was four years old, after Shelley and Steve Curry had divorced. He said of Shelley, "She did a hell of a job raising Martha. I was not there.

Carradine married [[Sandra Will Carradine|Sandra Will]] on February 6, 1982.

She hired and then became romantically involved with Pellicano after her divorce from Carradine. According to FBI documents, Pellicano tapped Carradine's telephone and recorded calls between him and girlfriend Hayley Leslie DuMond at Will's request, along with DuMond's parents.&lt;ref name= Wadler /&gt; Carradine filed a civil lawsuit against Will and Pellicano which was settled in 2013 before it went to trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/keith-carradine-settles-anthony-pellicano-651172 |title=Keith Carradine Settles Anthony Pellicano Lawsuit |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |date=2013-10-28 |accessdate=2014-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
