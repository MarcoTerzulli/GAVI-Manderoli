'''''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'''''{{efn|sometimes shortened to '''''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'''''}} is a six-volume work by the English historian [[Edward Gibbon]]. It traces Western civilization (as well as the [[Muslim conquests|Islamic]] and [[Mongolian Empire|Mongolian]] conquests) from the [[Nerva–Antonine dynasty|height]] of the [[Roman Empire]] to the [[Fall of Constantinople|fall]] of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. Volume&amp;nbsp;I was published in 1776 and went through six printings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward |last=Gibbon |author-link=Edward Gibbon |title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |volume=I |url=https://books.google.com/?id=aLcWAAAAQAAJ |year=1776 |publisher=W.

Strahan and T. Cadell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Edward Gibbon |title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |volume=VI |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CSg-AAAAcAAJ |year=1788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The original volumes were published in [[quarto]] sections, a common publishing practice of the time.&lt;/ref&gt;

The six volumes cover the history, from 98 to 1590, of the [[Roman Empire]], the history of [[early Christianity]] and then of the [[State church of the Roman Empire|Roman State Church]], and the history of Europe, and discusses the [[decline of the Roman Empire]] among other things.

== Thesis ==
Gibbon offers an explanation for the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]], a task made difficult by a lack of comprehensive written sources, though he was not the only historian to attempt it.{{efn|See for example [[Henri Pirenne#Pirenne Thesis|Henri Pirenne's (1862–1935) famous thesis]] published in the early 20th century. As for sources more recent than the ancients, Gibbon certainly drew on [[Montesquieu]]'s short essay, [[Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and their Decline]], and on previous work published by [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] (1627–1704) in his ''Histoire universelle à Monseigneur le dauphin'' (1763). see Pocock, ''The Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon, 1737–1764''. for Bousset, pp. 65, 145; for Montesquieu, pp. 85–88, 114, 223.}}

According to Gibbon, the Roman Empire succumbed to [[barbarian]] invasions in large part due to the gradual loss of [[civic virtue]] among its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;J.G.A. Pocock, "Between Machiavelli and Hume: Gibbon as Civic Humanist and Philosophical Historian," ''Daedalus'' 105:3 (1976), 153–169; and in '''[[#Further reading|Further reading]]:''' Pocock, ''The Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon, 1737–1764'', 303–304; ''The First Decline and Fall'', 304–306.&lt;/ref&gt; 
He began an ongoing controversy about the role of Christianity, but he gave great weight to other causes of internal decline and to [[Migration Period|attacks from outside the Empire]]. {{blockquote|The story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and, instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military government was relaxed, and finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians. |Edward Gibbon. ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Chapter 38 "General Observations on the Fall of the Roman Empire in the West"}}

Like other [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] citizens of the age steeped in institutional [[anti-Catholicism]], Gibbon held in contempt the [[Medievalism|Middle Ages]] as a priest-ridden, superstitious [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Age]].  It was not until his own era, the "Age of Reason", with its emphasis on rational thought, it was believed, that human history could resume its progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J.G.A. |last=Pocock |year=1976 |title=Between Machiavelli and Hume: Gibbon as Civic Humanist and Philosophical Historian |journal=Daedalus |volume=105 |issue=3 |pages=153–169}}; and in '''[[#Further reading|Further reading]]:''' Pocock, ''The Enlightenments of Edward Gibbon, 1737–1764'', 303–304; ''The First Decline and Fall'', 304–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==

Gibbon's tone was detached, dispassionate, and yet critical. He can lapse into moralisation and [[aphorism]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Foster|title=Melancholy Duty |url=https://books.google.com/?id=o5fcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63|year=2013|page=63|isbn=978-9401722353 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Citations and footnotes ===
Gibbon provides the reader with a glimpse of his thought process with extensive notes along the body of the text, a precursor to the modern use of footnotes. Gibbon's footnotes are famous for their idiosyncratic and often humorous style, and have been called "Gibbon's table talk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Saunders |editor-first=Dero A. |title=Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |year=1952 |location=New York |publisher=Penguin |at=page&amp;nbsp;23 (Introduction)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide an entertaining moral commentary on both [[ancient Rome]] and 18th&amp;nbsp;century [[Great Britain]]. This technique enabled Gibbon to compare ancient Rome to his own contemporary world. Gibbon's work advocates a [[rationalist]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] view of history.

Gibbon's citations provide in-depth detail regarding his use of sources for his work, which included documents dating back to ancient Rome. The detail within his asides and his care in noting the importance of each document is a precursor to modern-day historical footnoting methodology.

The work is notable for its erratic but exhaustively documented notes and research. [[J.B. Bury|John Bury]], following him 113&amp;nbsp;years later with his own ''History of the Later Roman Empire'', commended the depth and accuracy of Gibbon's work. Unusually for 18th&amp;nbsp;century historians, Gibbon was not content with second-hand accounts when primary sources were accessible. "I have always endeavoured", Gibbon wrote, "to draw from the fountain-head; that my curiosity, as well as a sense of duty, has always urged me to study the originals; and that, if they have sometimes eluded my search, I have carefully marked the secondary evidence, on whose faith a passage or a fact were reduced to depend."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |at=page&amp;nbsp;520, Preface to Gibbon's ''Volume the Fourth'' |editor-first=David |editor-last=Womersley |title=Edward Gibbon – The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |volume=2 |location=New York|publisher=Penguin Books |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Decline and Fall'' is a literary monument and a massive step forward in [[historical method]].{{efn|In the early 20th&amp;nbsp;century, biographer [[Sir Leslie Stephen]] summarized ''The History''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s reputation as a work of unmatched erudition, a degree of professional esteem which remains as strong today as it was then:&lt;blockquote&gt;The criticisms upon his book ... are nearly unanimous. In accuracy, thoroughness, lucidity, and comprehensive grasp of a vast subject, the History is unsurpassable.  It is the one English history which may be regarded as definitive.  ... Whatever its shortcomings, the book is artistically imposing as well as historically unimpeachable as a vast [[panorama]] of a great period.

==Criticism==
Numerous tracts were published criticising his work. In response, Gibbon defended his work with the 1779 publication of ''A Vindication ... of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Edward Gibbon| title = A vindication of some passages in the fifteenth and sixteenth chapters of The history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire: By the author| url = https://books.google.com/?id=tnxbAAAAQAAJ| year = 1779| publisher = Printed for W. Strahan; and T. Cadell, in the Strand.| isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks on Christianity aroused particularly vigorous attacks, but in the mid-twentieth century, at least one author claimed that "church historians allow the substantial justness of [Gibbon's] main positions."&lt;ref&gt;''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge'', vol. IV, eds. S.M. Jackson, et al. (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Book House, 1952), 483–484. [https://archive.org/details/newschaffherzog09haucgoog online].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misinterpretation of Byzantium===
Some historians such as [[John Julius Norwich]], despite their admiration for his furthering of historical methodology, consider Gibbon's hostile views on the [[Byzantine Empire]] flawed and blame him somewhat for the lack of interest shown in the subject throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;John Julius Norwich, ''Byzantium'' (New York: Knopf, 1989); ''Byzantium: the apogee'' (London and New York: Viking Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; This view might well be admitted by Gibbon himself: "But it is not my intention to expatiate with the same minuteness on the whole series of the Byzantine history."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25717 Preface of 1782 online].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Russian historian [[George Ostrogorsky]] writes, "Gibbon and [[Charles le Beau|Lebeau]] were genuine historians&amp;nbsp;– and Gibbon a very great one&amp;nbsp;– and their works, in spite of factual inadequacy, rank high for their presentation of their material."&lt;ref&gt;Georgije Ostrogorski  [https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22gibbon+and+lebeau+were+genuine+historians%22&amp;num=10 ''History of the Byzantine State'' (1986) p. 5 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gibbon's views on religion==

===Criticism of Quran and Muhammad===

Gibbon's comments on the [[Quran]] and [[Muhammad]] reflected his view of the secular origin of the text. He outlined in chapter 33 the widespread tale of the [[Seven Sleepers]],&lt;ref&gt;Rashid Iqbal, (2017). “A New Theory on Aṣḥāb al-kahf (The Sleepers of the Cave) Based on Evidence from the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS)”. Al-Bayān – Journal of Qurʾān and ḤadĪth Studies 15 (2017). {{DOI|10.1163/22321969-12340044}}. pp. 20–47. Retrieved from http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22321969-12340044#&lt;/ref&gt; and remarked "This popular tale, which Mahomet might learn when he drove his camels to the fairs of Syria, is introduced, as a divine revelation, into the Quran." His presentation of Muhammad's life again reflected his secular approach: "in his private conduct, Mahomet indulged the appetites of a man, and abused the claims of a prophet. A special revelation dispensed him from the laws which he had imposed on his nation: the female sex, without reserve, was abandoned to his desires; and this singular prerogative excited the envy, rather than the scandal, the veneration, rather than the envy, of the devout Mussulmans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25717|title=Chapter 50 of 'The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire'|first=Edward|last=Gibbon|website=[[Project Gutenberg]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on Jews and charge of antisemitism===
Gibbon described the Jews as "''a race of fanatics, whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government, but also of humankind''".&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, Edward. "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire", p. 521 in the first volume.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his view Gibbon has been accused of [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eipa.eu.com/category/information-centre/international-relations/anti-semitism/ | title=Anti-Semitism &amp;#124; EIPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of Christian martyrs===
Gibbon challenged Church history by estimating far smaller numbers of [[Christian martyrs]] than had been traditionally accepted. The Church's version of its early history had rarely been questioned before. Gibbon, however, knew that modern Church writings were [[secondary source]]s, and he shunned them in favor of [[primary source]]s.

===Christianity as a contributor to the fall and to stability: chapters XV, XVI===
Historian S. P. Foster says that Gibbon:
:blamed the otherworldly preoccupations of Christianity for the decline of the Roman empire, heaped scorn and abuse on the church, and sneered at the entirety of monasticism as a dreary, superstition-ridden enterprise. The ''Decline and Fall'' compares Christianity invidiously with both the pagan religions of Rome and the religion of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.P. Foster|title=Melancholy Duty: The Hume-Gibbon Attack on Christianity|url=https://books.google.com/?id=o5fcBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16|date= 2013|publisher=Springer |page=16|isbn=978-9401722353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume I was originally published in sections, as was common for large works at the time. The first two were well received and widely praised. The last quarto in Volume I, especially Chapters XV and XVI, was highly controversial, and Gibbon was attacked as a "[[paganism|paganist]]". Gibbon thought that Christianity had hastened the Fall, but also ameliorated the results:

{{quote|As the happiness of a future life is the great object of religion, we may hear without surprise or scandal that the introduction, or at least the abuse of Christianity, had some influence on the decline and fall of the Roman empire. The clergy successfully preached the doctrines of patience and pusillanimity; the active virtues of society were discouraged; and the last remains of military spirit were buried in the cloister: a large portion of public and private wealth was consecrated to the specious demands of charity and devotion; and the soldiers' pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity. Faith, zeal, curiosity, and more earthly passions of malice and ambition, kindled the flame of theological discord; the church, and even the state, were distracted by religious factions, whose conflicts were sometimes bloody and always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted from camps to synods; the Roman world was oppressed by a new species of tyranny; and the persecuted sects became the secret enemies of their country. Yet party-spirit, however pernicious or absurd, is a principle of union as well as of dissension. The bishops, from eighteen hundred pulpits, inculcated the duty of passive obedience to a lawful and orthodox sovereign; their frequent assemblies and perpetual correspondence maintained the communion of distant churches; and the benevolent temper of the Gospel was strengthened, though confirmed, by the spiritual alliance of the Catholics. The sacred indolence of the monks was devoutly embraced by a servile and effeminate age; but if superstition had not afforded a decent retreat, the same vices would have tempted the unworthy Romans to desert, from baser motives, the standard of the republic. Religious precepts are easily obeyed which indulge and sanctify the natural inclinations of their votaries; but the pure and genuine influence of Christianity may be traced in its beneficial, though imperfect, effects on the barbarian proselytes of the North. If the decline of the Roman empire was hastened by the conversion of Constantine, his victorious religion broke the violence of the fall, and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors (chap. 38).&lt;ref&gt;General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire In The West. Fall In The West – The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire by Edward Gibbon. http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25717&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Voltaire]] was deemed to have influenced Gibbon's claim that Christianity was a contributor to the fall of the Roman Empire.  As one pro-Christian commenter put it in 1840:

{{quote|As Christianity advances, disasters befall the [Roman] empire&amp;nbsp;– arts, science, literature, decay&amp;nbsp;– barbarism and all its revolting concomitants are made to seem the consequences of its decisive triumph&amp;nbsp;– and the unwary reader is conducted, with matchless dexterity, to the desired conclusion&amp;nbsp;– the abominable Manicheism of ''Candide'', and, in fact, of all the productions of Voltaire's historic school&amp;nbsp;– viz., "that instead of being a merciful, ameliorating, and benignant visitation, the religion of Christians would rather seem to be a scourge sent on man by the author of all evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dublin review: a quarterly and critical journal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JItKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA208|year=1840|publisher=Burns, Oates and Washbourne|pages=208–|quote=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JItKAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA208&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=ACfU3U2PHcJJoA3dkDDwsI-CJbanilJcVg&amp;ci=104%2C652%2C854%2C302&amp;edge=0 p.&amp;nbsp;208&amp;nbsp;image] at Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tolerant paganism===

Gibbon wrote:

{{quote|The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true; by the philosophers as equally false; and by the magistrate as equally useful.}} He has been criticized for his portrayal of Paganism as tolerant and Christianity as intolerant. In an article that appeared in 1996 in the journal ''[[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past &amp; Present]]'', H. A. Drake challenges an understanding of [[Persecution of religion in ancient Rome|religious persecution in ancient Rome]], which he considers to be the "conceptual scheme" that was used by historians to deal with the topic for the last 200 years, and whose most eminent representative is Gibbon. Drake counters:

{{quote|With such deft strokes, Gibbon enters into a conspiracy with his readers: unlike the credulous masses, he and we are cosmopolitans who know the uses of religion as an instrument of social control. So doing, Gibbon skirts a serious problem: for three centuries prior to Constantine, the tolerant pagans who people the Decline and Fall were the authors of several major persecutions, in which Christians were the victims. ... Gibbon covered this embarrassing hole in his argument with an elegant demur. Rather than deny the obvious, he adroitly masked the question by transforming his Roman magistrates into models of Enlightenment rulers&amp;nbsp;– reluctant persecutors, too sophisticated to be themselves religious zealots.}}

==Gibbon's reflections==
Gibbon's initial plan was to write a history "''of the decline and fall of the ''city'' of Rome''", and only later expanded his scope to the whole Roman Empire:&lt;blockquote&gt; If I prosecute this ''History'', I shall not be unmindful of the decline and fall of the ''city'' of Rome; an interesting object, to which my plan was originally confined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbon |first=Edward |authorlink=Edward Gibbon |title=The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |volume=3 |at=chapter&amp;nbsp;36, footnote&amp;nbsp;43 |year=1781}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although he published other books, Gibbon devoted much of his life to this one work (1772–1789). His autobiography [[Miscellaneous Works of Edward Gibbon#The Miscellaneous Works|''Memoirs of My Life and Writings'']] is devoted largely to his reflections on how the book virtually ''became'' his life. He compared the publication of each succeeding volume to a newborn child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Patricia B. |last=Craddock |title=Edward Gibbon, Luminous Historian |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins Univ.

Many writers have used variations on the series title (including using "Rise and Fall" in place of "Decline and Fall"), especially when dealing with large nations or empires.  [[Piers Brendon]] notes that Gibbon's work "became the essential guide for Britons anxious to plot their own imperial trajectory. They found the key to understanding the British Empire in the ruins of Rome."&lt;ref&gt;Piers Brendon, ''The Decline and Fall of the British Empire, 1781–1997'' (2008) p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The title and author are also cited in [[Noël Coward]]'s comedic poem "[[I Went to a Marvellous Party]]".{{efn|Link to notes on the poem here.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.noelcoward.net/ncmiindex/i1.html#iwtamp&lt;/ref&gt; Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;"If you have any mind at all,&lt;br /&gt;Gibbon's divine ''Decline and Fall'',&lt;br /&gt;Seems pretty flimsy,&lt;br /&gt;No more than a whimsy&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;."}} And in the poem "[[The Foundation of S.F. Success|The Foundation of Science Fiction Success]]", [[Isaac Asimov]] acknowledged that his [[Foundation (Asimov)|Foundation series]] – an epic tale of the fall and rebuilding of a galactic empire – was written "''with a tiny bit of cribbin' / from the works of Edward Gibbon''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=The Foundation of S.

Tepper]] gave one of her novels the title ''Gibbon's Decline and Fall''.

In 1995, an established journal of classical scholarship, ''Classics Ireland'', published [[Punk rock|punk]] musician's [[Iggy Pop]]'s reflections on the applicability of ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' to the modern world in a short article, ''Caesar Lives'', (vol.&amp;nbsp;2, 1995) in which he noted&lt;blockquote&gt;America is Rome. Of course, why shouldn't it be? We are all Roman children, for better or worse ... I learn much about the way our society really works, because the system-origins – military, religious, political, colonial, agricultural, financial – are all there to be scrutinised in their infancy. I have gained perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=25528281 |first=Iggy |last=Pop |author-link=Iggy Pop |title=Caesar lives |year=1995 |volume=2 |pages=94–96 |journal=Classics Ireland|doi=10.2307/25528281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
