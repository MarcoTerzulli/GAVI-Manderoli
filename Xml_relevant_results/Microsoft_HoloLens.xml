'''Microsoft HoloLens''', known under development as '''Project Baraboo''',&lt;ref name="Hempel0121" /&gt; is a pair of [[mixed reality]] [[smartglasses]] developed and manufactured by [[Microsoft]]. HoloLens was the first head-mounted display running the [[Windows Mixed Reality]] platform under the [[Windows 10]] computer operating system.

Along the bottom edges of the side, located near the user's ears, are a pair of small, red [[3D audio effect|3D audio]] speakers.

== Interface ==
HoloLens, through the use of the HPU, uses sensual and natural interface commands—gaze, gesture, and voice—sometimes referred to as "GGV", inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dev.windows.com/en-US/holographic/development_overview|title=Development overview|website=Windows Dev Center|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=March 1, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308061545/https://dev.windows.com/en-US/holographic/development_overview|archivedate=March 8, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaze commands, such as head-tracking, allows the user to bring application focus to whatever the user is perceiving.&lt;ref name="YT gaze"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCPiZlWdVws|title=Microsoft HoloLens: Gaze Input|date=February 29, 2016|publisher=Microsoft|access-date=March 7, 2016|quote=|people=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Elements"—or any virtual application or button—are selected using an air tap method, similar to clicking an imaginary [[computer mouse]]. The tap can be held for a drag simulation to move an element, as well as [[Speech recognition|voice commands]] for certain commands and actions.

The HoloLens [[Shell (computing)|shell]] carries over and adapts many elements from the Windows [[desktop environment]]. A "bloom" gesture for accessing the shell (performing a similar function to pressing a [[Windows key]] on a Windows keyboard or tablet, or the Xbox button on an [[Xbox One Controller]]) is performed by opening one's hand, fingers spread with the palm facing up.&lt;ref name="Restart2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/microsoft-nadella/|title=Restart: Microsoft in the age of Satya Nadella|date=January 21, 2015|publisher=Wired|quote=Each lens has three layers of glass—in blue, green, and red—full of microthin corrugated grooves that diffract light.

Virtual elements such as windows or menus can be "pinned" to locations, physical structures or objects within the environment; or can be "carried," or fixed in relation to the user, following the user as they move around.&lt;ref name="YT hologram"&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVXH5V8MVQo|title=Microsoft HoloLens: What is a hologram?|date=February 29, 2016|publisher=Microsoft|access-date=March 7, 2016|quote=|people=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Title bar]]s for [[Window (computing)|application windows]] have a title on the left, and buttons for [[Window manager|window management]] functions on the right.

In April 2016 Microsoft Created the [https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9nblggh4qwnx Microsoft HoloLens] App for Windows 10 PC's and [[Windows 10 Mobile]] devices, that allows developers to run apps, use his or her phone or PC's keyboard to type text, view a live stream from the HoloLens user's point of view, and remotely capture mixed reality photos and videos.

== Developing applications for HoloLens ==
[[Microsoft Visual Studio]] is an [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] that can be used to develop applications (both 2D and 3D) for HoloLens. Applications can be tested using HoloLens emulator (included into Visual Studio 2015 IDE) or HoloLens Development Edition.

=== 2D applications ===
HoloLens can run almost all [[Universal Windows Platform apps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/development_overview|title=Building 2D apps}}&lt;/ref&gt; These apps appear as 2D projections. Not all Windows 10 APIs are currently supported by HoloLens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/|title=Current limitations for apps using APIs from the shell}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in most cases the same app is able to run across all Windows 10 devices (including HoloLens), and the same tools that are used to develop applications for Windows PC or Windows Phone can be used to develop a HoloLens app.

=== 3D applications ===
3D applications, or "holographic" applications, use Windows Holographic APIs. Microsoft recommends [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] engine and [[Vuforia Augmented Reality SDK|Vuforia]] to create 3D apps for HoloLens, but it's also possible for a developer to build their own engine using [[DirectX]] and [[Windows API]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/holographic/development_overview|title=Development overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;
