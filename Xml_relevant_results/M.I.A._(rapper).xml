({{IPAc-en|ɛ|m|_|aɪ|_|eɪ}}), is a British rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, visual artist, and activist.  Combining elements of [[alternative music|alternative]], [[electronic dance|dance]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[world music]], her early compositions relied heavily on the [[Roland MC-505]] [[music sequencer]] and [[drum machine]], whilst her later work marked an evolution in her sound with rare instruments, electronics, and unusual sound samples. M.I.A.'s music lyrically incorporates a range of political, social, philosophical and cultural references. M.I.A. has embarked on five global headlining tours and is the founder of her own multimedia label, [[N.E.E.T. Recordings|N.E.E.T.]] 

Born in London to [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Sri Lankan Tamil]] parents, M.I.A. and her family moved to [[Jaffna]] in [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|northern Sri Lanka]] when she was six months old. The first 11 years of her life were marked by displacement caused by the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], and she and her family eventually returned to London as refugees. M.I.A. began her career in 2000 as a visual artist, filmmaker, and designer in West London before beginning her recording career in 2002. She was one of the first acts to come to public attention through the [[Internet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=How M.I.A. Reimagined Art for the Internet Age|url=https://www.anothermag.com/design-living/11187/how-mia-reimagined-art-for-the-internet-age|last=AnOther|date=2018-09-21|website=AnOther|language=en|access-date=2020-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; posting her songs and videos on platforms such as [[MySpace]], and rose to prominence in early 2004 for her singles "[[Sunshowers]]" and "[[Galang (song)|Galang]]".  

M.I.A. released her debut album ''[[Arular]]'' in 2005 followed by ''[[Kala (album)|Kala]]'' in 2007, which both received widespread critical acclaim. Her third album ''[[Maya (M.I.A. album)|Maya]]'' was released in 2010 soon after the controversial single-[[short film]] "[[Born Free (music video)|Born Free]]". The album received less favourable critical response compared to her previous records, but was her best-charting effort, reaching the top 10 in several countries. Her fourth studio album, ''[[Matangi (album)|Matangi]]'', was released in 2013 and produced the single "[[Bad Girls (M.I.A. song)|Bad Girls]]", which won several accolades at the [[2012 MTV Video Music Awards]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/one-direction-195-1265214|title=One Direction, Chris Brown, MIA win big at MTV VMAs {{!}} NME|date=2012-09-07|website=NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs {{!}} NME.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She released her fifth and final studio album, ''[[AIM (album)|AIM]]'', in 2016. The [[Biography|biographical]] [[documentary film]] about her, ''[[Matangi/Maya/M.I.A.]]'' (2018), won the World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Award at the [[2018 Sundance Film Festival]].  

Among M.I.A.'s [[List of awards and nominations received by M.I.A.|accolades]] include two [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP) awards, two [[MTV Video Music Award|MTV Video Music Awards]], and nominations for an [[Academy Award]], [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]], three [[Grammy Award]]s and the [[Mercury Prize]]; she is the first person of [[South Asia|South Asian]] descent to be nominated for an Academy Award and Grammy Award in the same year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was named one of the defining artists of the 2000s decade by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in its "Best of the Decade" list in December 2009. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] named her one of the world's [[Time 100|100 most influential people]] in 2009, and ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' ranked M.I.A. on its list of the 75 most influential people of the 21st century. According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', she was one of the "Top 50 Dance/Electronic Artists of the 2010s".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/MIA-1/chart-history/3BB|title=M.I.A.

==Life and career==
===1975–1999: Early life===
Mathangi "Maya" Arulpragasam was born on 18 July 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/mia/43637|title=MIA's baby's name revealed|work=[[NME]]|location=UK|date=23 March 2009|accessdate=2 April 2012|archivedate=17 April 2019| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417074848/https://www.nme.com/news/music/mia-150-1305021|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Hounslow|Hounslow, London]], the daughter of [[Arul Pragasam]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/20/mia-white-country-you-dont-have-to-spell-it-out|title=MIA: 'This a white country, you don't have to spell it out to me'|last=Iqbal|first=Nosheen|date=20 May 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=20 May 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] engineer, writer, and activist, and his wife, Kala, a seamstress.&lt;!-- mother's surname? --&gt; When she was six months old, her family moved to [[Jaffna]] in [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|northern Sri Lanka]], where her brother Sugu was born.&lt;ref name="sawyer"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sawyer|first=Miranda|title=MIA: 'I'm here for the people'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jun/13/mia-feature-miranda-sawyer|accessdate=23 July 2010|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=13 June 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, her father adopted the name Arular and became a political activist and founding member of the [[Eelam Revolutionary Organisation of Students]] (EROS), a political Tamil group affiliated with the [[LTTE]]. The first 11 years of Arulpragasam's life were marked by displacement caused by the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]].&lt;ref name="sawyer" /&gt; Her family went into hiding from the [[Sri Lankan Army]], and Arulpragasam had little contact with her father during this period. She has described her family as living in "big-time" poverty during her childhood but also recalls some of her happiest memories from growing up in Jaffna.&lt;ref name="sawyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MIANirali04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Flash-forward"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Empire, Kitty|title=Flash-forward|work=The Observer|location=UK|publisher=Guardian Media Group|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1438918,00.html|date=20 March 2005|accessdate=30 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maya attended Catholic convent schools such as the [[Holy Family Convent, Jaffna]], where she developed her art skills—painting in particular—to work her way up her class.&lt;ref name="apmia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MIAhightimesinterview"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Fortunato, John |title=I AM M.I.A.

During the civil war, soldiers would put guns through holes in the windows and shoot at the school, what she notes as "fun."&lt;ref name="MIAhightimesinterview" /&gt; Her classmates were trained to dive under the table or run next door to English-language schools that, according to her, "wouldn't get shot."&lt;ref name="MIAhightimesinterview" /&gt; Arulpragasam lived on a road alongside much of her extended family and played inside temples and churches in the town. Due to safety concerns, Arulpragasam's mother relocated herself and her children to [[Madras]] in India, where they lived in a derelict house and received sporadic visits from their father, who was introduced to the children as their "uncle" in order to protect them.&lt;ref name="sawyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="amgmiabio05"&gt;{{cite web|author=Kellman, Andy|title=M.I.A.: Short biography|website=allmusic|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p674864/biography|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate=30 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family, minus Arular, then resettled in Jaffna temporarily, only to see the war escalate further in [[North Eastern Province, Sri Lanka|northeast Sri Lanka]]. During this time, nine-year-old Arulpragasam's primary school was destroyed in a government raid.&lt;ref name="nlfw05"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Harrington, Richard|date=16 September 2005|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/15/AR2005091500697_pf.html|title=M.I.A., No Loss For Words|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=9 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbcmia05" /&gt;

Her mother then returned with her children back to London in 1986, a week before Arulpragasam's 11th birthday, where they were housed as refugees.&lt;ref name="sawyer" /&gt; Her father arrived on the island and became an independent peace mediator between the two sides of the civil war in the late 1980s–2010.&lt;ref name="popmattMay052" /&gt; Arulpragasam spent the rest of her childhood and teenage years living on the [[Phipps Bridge Estate]] in the [[Mitcham]] district of south London, where she learned to speak English, whilst her mother brought the children up on a modest income. Arulpragasam entered the final year of primary school in the autumn of 1986 and quickly mastered the English language. Hers was one of only two Asian families on the estate at the time,&lt;ref name="popmattMay052"&gt;{{cite web|author=Wheaton, Robert|title=London Calling – For Congo, Columbo, Sri Lanka..|work=[[PopMatters]]|url=https://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/mia-0505062.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124220154/http://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/mia-0505062.shtml|archivedate=24 January 2009|date=6 May 2005|accessdate=6 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an atmosphere she has described as "incredibly racist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=OxfordUnion|title=M.I.A {{!}} Full Q&amp;A {{!}} Oxford Union|date=10 May 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZHxzKwwgaY&amp;t=1m46s|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in England and raising her children, Arulpragasam's mother became a Christian in 1990 and worked as a seamstress for the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] for much of her career.&lt;ref name="MIANirali04" /&gt; She worked from her home in London's [[Tooting]] area. Arulpragasam has had a difficult relationship with her father, due to his political activities in the 1980s and complete absence during much of her life. Prior to the release of the first album, which Arulpragasam had named after her father, he emailed her: "This is Dad. Change the title of your album. I'm really proud. Just read about you in the ''Sri Lanka Times''. Dad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McLean|first1=Craig|title=Agent provocateur|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3666998/Agent-provocateur.html|accessdate=9 December 2014|agency=Telegraph|date=4 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; She chose not to change the album title. Arulpragasam attended the [[Ricards Lodge High School]] in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]]. Following high school, she attended Central Saint Martins by gaining admittance through unconventional means despite not having formally applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arthurmag.com/2007/02/11/interview-with-mia-from-arthur-magazine/|title=Interview with M.I.A. from ARTHUR No. 16 (May 2005)|date=11 February 2007|work=Arthur Magazine|access-date=16 August 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, she graduated from London's [[Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design]] with a degree in fine art, film, and video.&lt;ref name="MIANirali04"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mangla, Ismat|title=Not-So Missing in Action|work=Nirali Magazine|url=http://niralimagazine.com/2004/10/not-so-missing-in-action/|date=4 October 2004|accessdate=13 May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513082654/http://niralimagazine.com/2004/10/not-so-missing-in-action/|archivedate=13 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000–02: Visual art and film===
While attending [[Central St Martins College]], Arulpragasam wanted to make films and art depicting [[Realism (arts)|realism]] that would be accessible to everyone, something that she felt was missing from her classmates' ethics and the course criteria. At college, she found the fashion courses "disposable" and more current than the film texts that she studied.&lt;ref name="arthurmia"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arthurmag.com/2007/02/11/interview-with-mia-from-arthur-magazine/|title=Interview with M.I.A. from Arthur Magazine|author=Orlov, Piotr|date=2004{{ndash}}2005|work=Arthur|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maya told ''[[Arthur (magazine)|Arthur magazine]]'' "[Students there were] exploring apathy, dressing up in some pigeon outfit, or running around conceptualising ... It missed the whole point of art representing society. Social reality didn't really exist there; it just stopped at theory."&lt;ref name="arthurmia" /&gt; She cited "radical cinema" including [[Harmony Korine]], [[Dogme 95]] and [[Spike Jonze]] as some of her cinematic inspirations during film school.&lt;ref name="cmmia05"&gt;{{cite web|title=John Singleton – M.I.A. once eyed a career as a film-maker|work=[[Contactmusic.com]]|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/mia%20once%20eyed%20a%20career%20as%20a%20film-maker|date=4 October 2005|accessdate=20 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student, she was approached by director [[John Singleton]] to work on a film in Los Angeles after he had read a script she had written, though she decided not to take up the offer.&lt;ref name="cmmia05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sgmia05"&gt;{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Daniel|title=Interview: M.I.A|publisher=[[SuicideGirls]]|url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/M.I.A./|date=29 December 2005|accessdate=20 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her degree, M.I.A. prepared her departmental honours thesis on the film ''[[CB4]]''.&lt;ref name="miakw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/kehinde-wiley/#_|title=Kehinde Wiley|date=November 2008|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arulpragasam befriended students in the college's fashion, advertising and graphics departments.&lt;ref name="arthurmia" /&gt; She met [[Justine Frischmann]], front woman of the British band [[Elastica]], through her friend [[Damon Albarn]] at an [[Air (band)|Air]] concert in 1999, and Frischmann commissioned Arulpragasam to create the cover art for the band's 2000 album, ''[[The Menace (album)|The Menace]]'', and video document their American tour.&lt;ref name="apmia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nlfw05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbcmia05" /&gt; Arulpragasam returned to Jaffna in 2001 to film a documentary on Tamil youth, but was unable to complete the project because she encountered harassment.&lt;ref name="sgmia05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ggmia"&gt;{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/m-i-a-guerilla-goddess-20051229|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=15 December 2005|first=Mark|last=Binelli|title=Guerrilla Goddess|accessdate=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Arulpragasam's first [[Solo show (art exhibition)|public exhibition]] of paintings after graduating took place at the Euphoria Shop on London's [[Portobello Road]].

Arulpragasam cites the radio broadcasts she heard emanating from her neighbours' flats in the late 1980s as some of her first exposures to her earliest musical influences.&lt;ref name="popmattMay052" /&gt; From there, she developed an interest in hip-hop and dancehall, identifying with "the starkness of the sound" in records by [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[MC Shan]] and [[Ultramagnetic MCs]]; and the "weird, distinct style" of acts such as [[Silver Bullet (rapper)|Silver Bullet]] and [[London Posse]].&lt;ref name="pfMIA05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jackson|last=Reeves|title=Exclusive Interview with M.I.A|url=http://misc.vassar.edu/archives/2008/04/exclusive_inter.html|work=The Miscellany News|publisher=[[Vassar College]]|date=10 April 2008|accessdate=6 July 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005002510/http://misc.vassar.edu/archives/2008/04/exclusive_inter.html|archivedate=5 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In college she developed an affinity for [[Punk rock|punk]] and the emerging sounds of [[Britpop]] and [[electroclash]].&lt;ref name="fusedmag04" /&gt; M.I.A. cites [[The Slits]], [[Malcolm McLaren]] and [[The Clash]] as major influences.&lt;ref name="timeoutmia08"&gt;{{cite web|author=Todd, Bella|title=MIA: Interview|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/timeout-40/features/5781/MIA-interview.html|work=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out]]|date=22 September 2008|accessdate=6 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rebelyellmia" /&gt;

By 2001, Arulpragasam designed the cover for Elastica's last single "The Bitch Don't Work", and went on the road with the band to video document their tour. The tour's supporting act, [[electroclash]] artist [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]], introduced Arulpragasam to the [[Roland MC-505]] and encouraged her to make music, a medium in which Arulpragasam lacked confidence.&lt;ref name="nlfw05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fusedmag04"&gt;{{cite web|author=Pearson, Gemma|title=M.I.A|url=http://www.fusedmagazine.com/Past_Issues/Issue_21/M+26+2346+3bI+26+2346+3bA+26+2346+3b.aspx|work=[[Fused Magazine]]|year=2004|accessdate=4 September 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927005531/http://www.fusedmagazine.com/Past_Issues/Issue_21/M%2B26%2B2346%2B3bI%2B26%2B2346%2B3bA%2B26%2B2346%2B3b.aspx|archivedate=27 September 2007|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; While holidaying together in [[Bequia]] in the Caribbean, Arulpragasam began experimenting with Frischmann's MC-505.&lt;ref name="MIANirali04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="apmia"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Maclean, Craig|title=Agent Provocateur|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3666998/Agent-provocateur.html|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|publisher=The Telegraph|date=4 August 2007|accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She adopted her stage name, "M.I.A.", standing for "Missing In [[Acton, London|Acton]]"&lt;!-- NOT A TYPO. --&gt; during this time.&lt;ref name="Flash-forward" /&gt; In her 2012 book Arulpragasam writes, "M.I.A. came to be because of my missing cousin.

M.I.A.'s next single, "[[Sunshowers]]", released on 5 July 2004, and its B-side ("Fire Fire") described [[guerrilla warfare]] and [[Refugee|asylum seeking]], merging ambiguous references to violence and religious persecution with black and white forms of dissidence.&lt;ref name="mmmia" /&gt; These themes inspired her [[film treatment|treatment]] for the music video, the first she wrote.

Both singles appeared on international publications' "Best of the Year" lists and subsequently "Best of the Decade" lists. The songs "Pull Up the People", "Bucky Done Gun" and "" were released as [[12-inch single]]s and CDs by XL Recordings, which along with the non-label mashup [[mixtape]] of ''Arular'' tracks, ''[[Piracy Funds Terrorism]],'' were distributed in 2004 to positive critical acclaim.&lt;ref name="amgmiabio05" /&gt;

===2006–08: ''Kala'' and world recognition===
[[File:Mia20061.jpg|left|thumb|upright|M.I.A. performing at the Prince in Melbourne in February 2006.]]
In 2006, M.I.A. recorded her second studio album ''[[Kala (album)|Kala]]'', this time named after her mother. Due to [[Visa (document)|visa]] complications in the [[United States]], the album was recorded in a variety of locations — [[India]], [[Trinidad]], [[Liberia]], [[Jamaica]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Eventually the album was completed in the US.&lt;ref name="villagevoicemia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miafadermag07" /&gt;

She has said of the sometimes "unaffected" vocals and delivery of her lyrics, "It is what it is. Most people would just put it down to me being lazy.

===Image and stage===
[[Sasha Frere-Jones]], critic of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' praised the self-made "unpretentious, stuck together with Scotch tape" style that M.I.A. achieves with her Roland MC-505 drum machine and keyboard unit, noting that many people had tried to copy the style since.&lt;ref name="gq"&gt;{{cite web|author=Shteyngart, Gary|title=She Might Get Loud: M.I.A|url=https://www.gq.com/entertainment/celebrities/201007/mia-profile|work=[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]|date=July 2010|accessdate=15 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her considerable influence on American hip hop music as an international artist is described by Adam Bradley and Andrew DuBois in ''The Anthology of Rap'' as making her an "unlikely" hip hop celebrity, given that the genre was one of several influences behind M.I.A.'s "eccentric and energizing" music and that the musician's unclassifiable sound was one example of how hip hop was changing as it came into contact with other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Adam Bradley|author2=Andrew DuBois|title=The Anthology of Rap|year=2010|publisher=[[Yale University Press]]|isbn=978-0-300-14190-0|url=https://archive.org/details/anthologyofrap00brad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Jeffrey H. Wallenfeldt writes in ''The Black experience in America : from civil rights to the present'' that no single artist may have personified hip hop in the 21st century better than M.I.A., in her "politically radical lyrics drawing from widely diverse sources around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey H Wallenfeldt|year=2011|title=The Black experience in America : from civil rights to the present|publisher=New York : Britannica Educational Pub., in association with Rosen Educational Services|edition=1|isbn=978-1-61530-177-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' critic Hattie Collins commented of M.I.A.'s influence, "A [[new rave]]r before it was old. A [[baile funk]]/pop pioneer before [[CSS (band)|CSS]] and [[Bonde do Rolê]] emerged. A quirky female singer/rapper before the Mini [[Lily Allen|Allens]] had worked out how to log on to MySpace.

The chart success of grime-influenced artists like M.I.A. is heralded as a signal in the way that white Britons adapted to a new multicultural and plural musical mix in contrast to bands of the [[Britpop]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andy Bennett|author2=Jon Stratton|title=Britpop and the English Music Tradition|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7546-6805-3|oclc=663973447|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, her work being used as a global resource for the articulation of differently located themes and its connections to many music traditions is noted by Brian Longhurst in ''Popular music and society'' (2007) to illustrate such processes of interracial dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Longhurst, Brian|title=Popular music and society|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7456-3162-2|page=146|oclc=237190093|publisher=Cambridge, UK Polity Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Shteyngart]] writing in [[GQ (magazine)|GQ]] notes that "M.I.A. is perhaps the preeminent global musical artist of the 2000s, a truly kick-ass singer and New York-Londony fashion icon, not to mention a vocal supporter of Sri Lanka's embattled Tamil minority, of which she's a member."&lt;ref name="gq" /&gt;

M.I.A.'s stage performances are described as "highly energetic" and multimedia showcases, often with scenes of what ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' critic [[Rob Sheffield]] describes as "jovial chaos, with dancers and toasters and random characters roaming the stage," bringing various crowds with interests in art, music and fashion.&lt;ref name="bhmia"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rob-sheffield/blogs/Sheffield_May2010/122272/79703|title=M.I.A.: Invasion of the Bona Fide Art Hustlers|work=Rolling Stone|date=28 June 2010|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camille Dodero, writing in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' opined that M.I.A.

===Themes and artwork===
M.I.A. has become known for integrating her imagery of political violence into her music videos and her cover art. Her politically inspired art became recognised while she exhibited and published several of her brightly coloured stencils and paintings portraying the tiger, a symbol of [[Tamil nationalism]], ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka and urban Britain in the early 2000s. Lyrics on ''[[Arular]]'' regarding her experiences of identity politics, poverty, revolution, gender and sexual stereotypes, war, and the conditions of working class in London were hailed as new and unorthodox, setting her apart from previous artists.&lt;ref name="rebelyellmia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mmmia" /&gt; The album references the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and the [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Tamil independence movements]] and features [[culture jamming]], multi-lingual slang, strident and subtle imagery. Her albums' social commentary and storytelling have incited debate on the "invigoratingly complex" politics of the issues she highlighted in the album, breaking taboos while the West was engaged in the 2003 Iraq War in the Middle East during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name="MIANirali04" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stylusmagazine1941" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ftguard05"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Lynskey, Dorian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/apr/22/popandrock1|title=Fighting talk|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=22 April 2005|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M.I.A.

Many related her experiences during recording sessions in Madras, Angola, Trinidad shantytowns, Liberia and London, and were well acclaimed.&lt;ref name="rebelyellmia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miafadermag07" /&gt; The album's artwork was inspired by African art, "from dictator fashion to old stickers on the back of cars," which like her clothing range, she hoped would capture "a 3-D sense, the shapes, the prints, the sound, film, technology, politics, economics" of a certain time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIA Talks Fashion|url=http://www.thefader.com/2008/10/24/stylee-fridays-mia-talks-fashion/|work=[[The Fader]]|date=24 October 2008|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[I-D magazine]]'' described the "bleeding cacophany of graphics" on her website during this time as evoking the "noisy amateurism" of the early web, but also embodying a rejection of today's "glossy, professional site design" which was felt to "efface the medium rather than celebrate it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ashlock, Jesse|title=Trend:Back to the Future|work=[[I-D magazine|I-D]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601094430/http://www.id-mag.com/article/BacktotheFuture/|archivedate=1 June 2008|url=http://www.id-mag.com/article/BacktotheFuture/|date=6 February 2008|accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Chang (journalist)|Jeff Chang]], writing for ''[[The Nation]]'', described a "Kala for the Nation" and the album's music, lyrics and imagery as encompassing "everywhere – or, to be specific, everywhere but the First World's self-regarding 'here'," stating that against a media flow that suppresses the "ugliness" of reality and fixes beauty to consumption, M.I.A. forces a conversation about how the majority live, closing the distance "between 'here' and everywhere else".

===Fashion and style===
[[File:MIA Bonnaroo 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|M.I.A. performing on the [[People vs. Money Tour]]]]
M.I.A. cites [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] art and fashion as major influences. Her mother works as a [[seamstress]] in London. An early interest in fashion and textiles – designing confections of "bright fluorescent fishnet fabrics" — was a hallmark of her time at [[Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design|Central Saint Martins College]]. M.I.A. was a roommate of fashion designer [[Luella Bartley]] and is a long-time friend of designer [[Carri Mundane]].&lt;ref name="nirmagmia06"&gt;{{cite web|title=Luella Bartley &amp; M.I.A|work=Nirali Magazine|url=http://niralimagazine.com/2006/08/luella-bartley-mia/|date=11 August 2006|accessdate=19 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AfrikanBoyCassetterwd"&gt;{{Cite magazine|author=Emmanuel 'BoyWonder' Ezugwu|title=Head2head: Afrikanboy Vs Cassette Playa|url=http://www.rwdmag.com/articles/6794/Head2head-Afrikanboy-Vs-Cassette-Playa.html|magazine=[[Rewind Magazine]]|accessdate=23 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330063018/http://www.rwdmag.com/articles/6794/Head2head-Afrikanboy-Vs-Cassette-Playa.html|archivedate=30 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clothes from her limited-edition "Okley Run" line — [[Mexican people|Mexican]] and Afrika line jackets and leggings, Islamic-inspired and [[water melon]]-print hoodies, and tour-inspired designs – were sold in 2008 during New York fashion week.&lt;ref name="rebelyellmia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miatfash" /&gt;&lt;ref name="miafaokley08"&gt;{{cite web|title=The FADER – Style: MIA's New Fashion Label|work=[[The Fader]]|url=http://www.thefader.com/articles/2008/7/15/style-mia-s-new-fashion-label|date=15 July 2008|accessdate=11 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She commented, "I wanted to tie all my work together.

So this Okley run was an extension of my Kala album and artwork."&lt;ref name="miatfash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2008/10/24/stylee-fridays-mia-talks-fashion/#ixzz0wDOif9Fa|title=Stylee Fridays: MIA Talks Fashion " The FADER|work=[[The Fader]]|accessdate=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Spin'' described her designs as "1000 watt Malcolm McLaren-meets-[[Jean-Michel Basquiat|Basquiat]]", that complimented her personal style that could "run from futurist aerobic instructor to [[New wave music|new wave]] [[pirate]] to queenly candy raver".&lt;ref name="rebelyellmia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spinjd" /&gt;

Contrary to her present style, M.I.A.'s ''Arular'' era style has been described as "tattered hand me downs and patched T-shirts of indigents", embodying the "uniform of the [[refugee]]" but modified with cuts, alterations and colours to fashion a distinctly new style and apparel line.&lt;ref name="ariyammia" /&gt; M.I.A. built on this during the ''Kala'' era with a "playful" combination of baggy T-shirts, leggings and short-shorts. She incorporated eccentric accessories in bold patterns, sparkle and "over-saturated" neon colour to fashion her signature style which inspired flocks of "garishly-clothed all-too-sassy" new-rave girls with bright red tights, cheetah-skin smock and faded 1980s T- shirts. Her commodifying and performance of this refugee image has been noted to "reposition" perceptions of it in the wider public. Hailed as presenting a challenge to the mainstream with her ironic style, M.I.A. has been praised for dictating such a subcultural trend worldwide, combining "adolescent" frustrations of race and class with a strong desire to dance.&lt;ref name="manginomia"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mangino|first=Gabriella Marie|title="To Congo, To Colombo, can't stereotype my thing yo:" M.I.A.'s Politics of Difference|year=2008|journal=Arts and Sciences Honors Theses|series=The Ohio State University.

==Accolades==
[[File:Miamayatour2011peaceandlovea.jpg|upright|right|thumb|M.I.A. performing at [[Peace &amp; Love (festival)|Peace &amp; Love]] during the [[Maya Tour]], 2011 following the release of her ''[[Vicki Leekx]]'' mixtape]]
M.I.A.'s first two albums generated widespread acclaim. ''[[PopMatters]]'' writer Rob Wheaton felt M.I.A. subverted the "abstract, organized, refined" distilling of violence in Western popular music and imagination and made her work represent much of the developing world's decades-long experiences of "arbitrary, unannounced, and spectacular" slaughter, deeming her work an "assault" with realism.&lt;ref name="popmattMay052" /&gt; Some detractors criticised M.I.A. early in her music career for "using radical chic" and for her attendance of an art school.&lt;ref name="ftguard05" /&gt; Critic [[Simon Reynolds]], writing in ''The Village Voice'' in 2005 saw this as a lack of authenticity and felt M.I.A. was "a veritable vortex of discourse, around most likely irresolvable questions concerning authenticity, post-colonialism, and dilettantism". He continued that while swayed by her chutzpah and ability to deliver live, he "was also turned off by the stencil-sprayed projection imagery of grenades, tanks, and so forth (redolent of the Clash with their strife-torn Belfast stage backdrops and [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] cred by association)" while the "99 percent white audience punched the air", admonishing what he perceived as a "lack of local character" to her debut album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reynolds, Simon|title=Piracy Funds What?|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-02-15/music/piracy-funds-what/|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=15 January 2005|accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Robert Christgau]] described Reynolds' argument as "cheap tack" in another article written in the publication, stating M.I.A's experiences connected her to world poverty in a way "few Western whites can grasp". He questioned why M.I.A.'s 2001 Alternative Turner Prize nominated images of pastel-washed tigers, soldiers, guns, armoured vehicles, and fleeing civilians that bedeck M.I.A.'s albums and videos were not assumed or analysed as being incendiary propaganda, suggesting that unlike art buyers, rock and roll fans were "assumed to be stupid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christgau, Rob|title=Burning Bright|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-02-22/music/burning-bright/|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=22 February 2005|accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds later argued that M.I.A. was the "Artist of the Decade" in a 2009 issue of ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Reynolds, Simon|title=Notes on the noughties: Is MIA artist of the decade?|work=The Guardian|location=UK|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/dec/16/mia-artist-of-the-decade|date=16 December 2009|accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music culture writer Michael Meyer opined that M.I.A.'s record imagery, lyrical booklets, homepages and videos supported the "image of provocation yet also avoidance of, or inability to use consistent images and messages." Instead of catering to stereotypes, he felt that M.I.A. "played with them" creating an uncategorisable and hence unsettling result.&lt;ref name="mmmia" /&gt; Critic Zach Baron felt that it had been shown in her career that M.I.A. had "always been adept at using a larger force against itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Baron, Zach|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2010/06/117964/education-maya-arulpragasam?page=all|title=The education of Maya Arulpragasam|date=22 June 2010|accessdate=6 January 2012|work=Capital New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; M.I.A. has been hailed as demonstrating dislocation to be a "productive site of departure" and praised for her ability to transform such a "disadvantage" into a creative form of expression.&lt;ref name="ariyammia"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ariyam|first=Derick Kirishan|title=Imagining Sri Lanka : Expatriated "Revisions" of the Nation|year=2010|journal=Master's Theses, Dissertations and Graduate Research Overview|volume=35|publisher=[[Rhode Island College]]|url=http://digitalcommons.ric.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1035&amp;context=etd|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
{{quote box|quote=I'm not coming at it as a politician, it's my own personal experience.

Or that only politicians are allowed to talk about politics, and that's why we're fucked, because the cycle is constantly kept within that fucking framework. There aren't more people standing up and telling their personal experience ... if a normal civilian comes up and says 'Hey, this happened in my village and I'm not happy about it', we're not allowed to talk about it. You have to follow this bureaucratic bullshit to get any sort of action, and it's all part of this cycle. Like back in the day, we had ideals of revolution and fighting back, and most of the time that shit starts with individual people having personal relationships, these experiences. And now it's so disconnected and the media can paint a picture for you ... they make so much bureaucracy and politics, and I think taking away the personal aspects, the human aspects of these political issues is really wrong. Whether it's the floods, or starving people in Africa, or whatever.

In a video shared on her social channels she said: "I don't usually believe politicians, but I think Corbyn is actually, like, real."

===Media===
M.I.A.'s relationship with some media outlets has been controversial.&lt;ref name="melissakapadiabodi1" /&gt; M.I.A. confronted [[Pitchforkmedia]] in 2007, citing sexism and racist mechanisms as possible reasons for misattribution of some of her work in her career.&lt;ref name="melissakapadiabodi1" /&gt; In 2010, M.I.A. tweeted "Fuck the New York Times," after ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a critical article by Lynn Hirschberg about M.I.A. and the conflict that portrayed the musician as politically naive and hypocritical. Both M.I.A. and several pop culture media outlets were highly critical of Hirschberg's article and reporting. Hirschberg later published a correction, apologising for reporting quotes made by the artist out of order.&lt;ref name="sawyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spinjd"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dolan, Jon|title=Deconstructing M.I.A|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7bCBYl1V2xAC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=MIA+sPIN#v=onepage&amp;q=MIA%20sPIN|date=August 2010|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="impmia"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarahanna|title=In Defense of M.I.A|url=http://www.imposemagazine.com/bytes/in-defense-of-mia|work=Impose Magazinedate=28 May 2010|accessdate=17 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2010/06/lynn_hirschberg_2.php|title=Lynn Hirschberg's M.I.A.

===Philanthropy===

It's not that I got with Ben and then suddenly I was a billionaire. You know? I got with Ben, and I realised that we do come from different worlds, but it's interesting that it is more about the concepts of, again, elitism and power.
